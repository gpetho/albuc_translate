After I have finished with you, my Son, this book which is the most recent of my works in medicine, completed with the addition of the present treatise, and following the exposition of its parts and the statements of its author, I have deemed it fitting to present to you this work which is a part of the art of surgery, namely surgery with the hand.
Since surgery with the hand is a matter of great importance in our times and in our age, and since it is a subject which has been neglected for a long time: except for a few scattered descriptions in the ancient books, which have been altered by the hand itself: there has arisen a great error and hesitation, until the intentions of the art have been closed and its science prolonged. It seemed good to me to restore life to this art with the help of the ordination of this treatise according to its position, declaration and abbreviation: and to bring together the forms of the instruments of cautery and other implements of the art, with the addition of their declaration and the improvement of their preparation which is necessary.
The reason why one does not easily find a good surgeon of his hand in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and the author must exercise himself beforehand in the science of anatomy as Galen has narrated, until he knows the movements of the limbs, their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, lacerations, and the number of each, and their exit, and the pulse of the veins, and quietness, and the locations of their exits
And for this reason Hippocrates said, "A name is nothing in itself, but in its work it is much.
We have indeed mentioned this in the beginning of this book.
For he who is ignorant of the science of anatomy will fall into error, and will endanger human life. As for me, I have seen many who have puffed up with pride about this science without any knowledge or experience
Why did the doctor order the securing of the swelling in the woman's neck with a scrofula, since it involved the incisions of some arteries in the neck? Because of this, blood flowed from the woman until she died between her hands.
And the other physician thought that he should remove a stone which was in the urine, which was causing her pain, and the stone was large. Therefore he came to him and extracted it with the bladder stone Because the man died on the third day.
And indeed I was called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die
And another physician saw that a certain Duke of our land had taken a medicine: and it happened to the black eunuch who was with him that he fractured his leg near the ankle: and the physician, with his ignorance, bound the fracture with nails and pins, and did not allow the wound to drain.
And he died according to his desires. Then he dismissed him after a few days and commanded him not to move the ligament: and he stood thus until the swelling of his leg was gone, and his foot and leg together, and he came to his end
I was called to him again: and I set about resolving the ligament: and there was peace, and he was freed from his pains
But indeed the corruption was confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Therefore the corruption ceased to advance in the limb until it died.
And another physician saw that he perforated a cancerous swelling: and it ulcerated after a few days, until the malignancy of the disease increased with the master himself
When the cancer is pure and arises from melancholic humour, it must not be held together with iron throughout, except in the member which can tolerate it, in order that the whole of it may be excised.
And for this reason, my son, you must know that an operation is divided into two parts: namely, the operation which is associated with health, and the operation which carries the risk in various conditions.
I am excited about all the places in this book where the operation is mentioned which carries terror and fear.
Therefore you must be careful about this, and fear it: so that they do not find pride in speaking falsely, and be dishonest
Receive therefore measure with humility and protection, and the sick with ease and firmness, and use the better way that brings glory to God for the healing and praiseworthy succession: and send away the terrifying diseases that are difficult to cure: and take away the spirits of those who make you fear, so that there should appear no hesitation in your faith and comfort for you
For in this way remains the measure of your glory, and the sublimation in this world, and afterwards to the quantity of your souls
For Galen has said in some of his admonitions. You do not heal a bad disease: do not call a bad doctor by name
I have however divided this treatise into three chapters.
First chapter.
Of cautery with fire, and cautery with acute medicine, a chapter, and arranged from the head to the feet, and forms of instruments, and materials for cautery: and everything that is necessary for the operation.
Second Chapter.
On section and perforation, phlebotomy and packing, wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and things of that sort: and the whole chapter, arranged in the form of instruments.
Third Chapter.
On restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and things of that sort: the whole chapter, arranged from the head to the feet, and the form of instruments.
But before anything else that we remember of an operation, it is necessary to say what is the quality of the dressings and instruments: and in what complexion it should be shown
I say therefore, that the discourse concerning the quality of the cautery dressing and instrument is a profound, subtle, scientific, and occult discourse.
And it has been spoken by many learned men in this matter, and they have disagreed among themselves: and indeed little is sufficient from their discourses, fearing the prolongation of the discourse.
I say therefore, that the cautery is universal in all complexion, which is with matter and without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter
In the hot and dry complexion with matter they disagree among themselves. Some indeed say that the cautery is useful in these. Others have also said that Cauterium is not suitable for an ailment caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat: and it is inappropriate to cure a heat and dry ailment with heat and dryness.
Others have also said that Cauterium causes injury in all heat and dry ailments which occur in the bodies of men: for when you compare the body of a man with fire, and moisten it, you find the body of a man to be cold
I too have heard from experience that this is the case.
It is true that one must not proceed without first having learned, practiced in the last exercise of the Cauterium chapter, recognized the diversity of human complexions, and become acquainted with the causes and effects of ailments, and their times
The rest, however, of complexions is not dangerous: especially in cold and wet ailments. I myself have seen all physicians agree about this: and they do not refrain from using Cauterium in these ailments.
And behold, the sons have said: The secret of treatment by Cauterium with fire is better than the secret of treatment with burning medicine: for fire is simple, whose action does not remain except on the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm any other connected member except for a slight burn.
Burning medicine, however, has an action that extends beyond the member which is being cauterized: and perhaps causes difficulty in the healing of the ailment in the member itself, and perhaps brings about death.
Fire, however, on account of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, except in excess.
I am now convinced by experience, through the length of my service and study with art, and the position over truth of things: and because of this, I am excused from the length of the oration.
And if this is not sufficient, since it is not permitted for this book of mine, I will declare a secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies expelled by it, which expels diseases with philosophical demonstration, agreeable to the thoughts of the wise.
And know ye, my sons, that they themselves dissent in the time when it becomes necessary to make the cautery, and they advise me to make a better time of your work.
I say that the cautery is suitable for all times: for indeed the document grows dull through the passage of time, which is attracted by the cautery.</start_of_turn> And above all, if the cautery is for necessary and severe pains, which are urgent, which do not tolerate delay: for indeed they fear from the fire that arises from the evil which increases more than the slight dullness which the document suffers through the passage of time.</start_of_turn>
And let it not be thought by anyone, my sons, or any doctor, that because of this I do not esteem the learned and skilled physicians, for indeed the sickness which is cured by the cautery is not always the same: and they put this in consequence, and it is not so as they think: for the cautery is not, except in the place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries up humours which are the causes of the disease.</start_of_turn
But indeed the cautery surpasses medicine by the swiftness of its action, the excellence of its operation, and the extent of its mastery: and it is possible that the disease will vanish at some later time according to the complexion of the patient, the location of the disease, and the excellence of the treatment: and that which is prepared in his body from the collection of superfluous humours in him: and that which proceeds from the disease itself in its acquisition from foods and like things, except in the case of those diseases in which the cautery is administered.</start_of_turn
Acute pain in a limb with few superficial wounds, and moisture, like a tooth cautery due to pain, is possible, lest it return in that place with pain. But this is done in few cases.</start_of_turn>
Indeed, the word often returns, for the cautery is the most recent of medicine. It is the right word: not for what they wish for it, for they believe that there is no cure that can be compared with medicine, neither with anything after the cautery.</start_of_turn>
The thing, however, is contrary to that. For the intention of the cautery being the most recent of medicine is not, except when we employ other modes of treatment in some ailment, and these do not confer that healing: we then apply the cautery at the end of everything, and that does confer. From that time forward, because the cautery is the most recent of medicine, not according to the intention which the vulgar people and many learned physicians understand.</start_of_turn>
The ancients said that the cautery with gold is better than with iron: and they did not say that except because of the equality of the gold and the fineness of its substance. And they said that it does not form pus at the place of the cautery.</start_of_turn> But this is not absolutely true. For I have seen that it does not cause this in some bodies without other things.</start_of_turn>
And the cautery with the instrument itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.</start_of_turn But when you apply the cautery with fire from gold, you must not declare that it has been kindled according to the quantity you wish, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches the cold and you add to it the fire from below, it liquefies in the fire, and turns into plates.</start_of_turn
Why does the artificer depart from this work in pursuit of his business? And because of this, Cauterium is made with iron among us more rapid and proximate to the operation, from rectitude to the work.
I also command this chapter on Cauterium to be read, following the chapters: and I command these things from the head to the feet: so that they may satisfy anyone who seeks anything from this.
Chapter 2: On the cauterization of the head in the coronal suture
Here is cauterization is made to the lord of humidity and cold over the brain: which are two causes of sweat, and the multitude of flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and the multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain: and in general all ailments which arise from cold, such as paralysis, and sweat, and seizures, and apoplexy, and things similar to these from ailments.
The method of cauterization is as follows: when the patient is most feverish: when he is evacuated at first with a physician who gives a medicinal salve to the head for three nights, or four, according to the nature of the patient, his age, and his habits.
Then command him to make a mark on his head with a needle. Then make him sit between your hands square, so that you can put your hands on his chest
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes Wherever your middle finger reaches, that is the place to make the burn with the cautery
Then ignite Cauterium with olive oil: thus is its form
Then place it upon the marked place with an incision, and let it descend gradually, so that your hand may withdraw it slowly. Then draw out your hand quickly and look at the place
If you see any amount of bone or herb remaining, then draw out your hand. And if not, repeat drawing out your hand with the instrument, or with another one if it is cold: until you see the bones, as I have said to you.
Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and drink from it, and put it upon the place: and leave it for three days.
Then put upon it butter soaked in oil, and leave the bandage above the place until the eschar is consumed by fire. Then care for it with unguents of four herbs, until it is healed
I have said that the more the wound remains open, the more pus it emits: which is better and more advantageous
And some people say that the skin should be cauterized until the bone is reached: and hold the Cauterium until something of the thickness of an os is burnt.
Then withdraw after that which has been burned from the bone, and then care for it
And some say that it is necessary that the Cauterium should remain until the very end, until it has left an imprint in the bone like a mark of the alphabet, so that the bone is fractured: or that a woman should put an instrument infused with a small letter into the wound: and they say that it should be withdrawn when the vapor of the head escapes from this place for a long time
Then he cares until consolidated.
Neither of two kinds of cautery is used in all men, except in some in whom it is feared according to their temperaments.
And dismiss it; it is better with me for the health of the patient
The head weakens from the continuity of its natural solution: as we have witnessed in the rest of the limbs: and especially when the head of the patient is weak by nature: for the first kind of cautery is more safe and better with me, and this is what is useful: to work with it for the health of the patient.
Head Chapter III.
When in the whole head there occurs a chronic pain that lasts in the patient, and it is accompanied by fever, and swelling, and blisters, and oils, and other things are used for it And especially if it has already been cauterized once with the cautery which we mentioned, and nothing more is added to it: then consider it For if the head of the patient is strong in creation by nature, and is not weak, and if there is inflammation: then cauterize with another cautery under that little bit Then cauterize it over all the hairs of the head with the cautery, so that it does not penetrate the skin, and uncover only the quantity of bone that we have mentioned And cauterize it once with the cautery in the nape of the neck of the head, in the place which is called the uas: and this is the place where the marrow is placed: and raise the mat of hair in this, and do not uncover the bone The sick man finds it on account of that pain which he suffers, and diverse from the rest of the pains of the head.
And I say that this Cauterium is in its place: and it is necessary that it be Cauterium, with which the horns of the head and its occiput are cauterized, and the middle part of the head is cauterized more finely
Chapter III
When it happens in the part of the head that there is pain and heat, or that the pain extends to the eye, and it is evacuated with medicines that soothe the head, and the rest of the treatment is administered as I have said in the discussion of diseases, and it does not suffice for it: then cauterization is done in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with an iron.</start_of_turn>
But as for cauterization with acute burning medicine, that is, that you take a tooth of the other side and burn the surface of the cauterization, and cut off its extremities from both sides.</start_of_turn Then cut off the place of pain in time with a wide vein cut, until there is in that place under the skin, where the tooth is caught.</start_of_turn
Introduce it into that place under the skin, until it is hidden: then bind up above it with a bandage of constriction, and leave it for fifteen hours, then take it out, and wash away the pus. Afterwards put over it a soaked cushion in butter, until the place has healed. Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And if anyone wishes to do this with some of the physicians who burn [medicines], as I wrote in the twelfth tractate, on Physicians who endure.
Burning with iron is indeed done in this way.</start_of_turn> The iron is ignited in this fashion.</start_of_turn>
And it is called Clavius: because its shape is like the head of a key, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small protrusion.</start_of_turn
Then place it over the place and hold your hand: and gradually withdraw the iron with speed: and let the quantity which endures from the thickness of the skin be as much as half of it.</start_of_turn And lift your hand, so that the artery beneath does not burn, and blood flow does not occur.</start_of_turn
Then soak the wound in salt water, and place over the place, and leave it for three days: then place the wound with butter: afterwards care with ointment until it has healed.</start_of_turn>
And if necessary, burn this hemibranium with the second extremity of the knife of Cautery.</start_of_turn Burn from the incision of the artery in this half-brain, not in the old way.</start_of_turn
In the old way of cautery in the half-brain.</start_of_turn
When you have cured the half-brain, when that which we said concerning the treatment of ailments has been done, and when we have said concerning the precautions for diseases, and it does not suffice: and if you see from the disease that it does not suffice with the first cautery with medicine, or with the cautery with fire, then you must burn the Cautery knife until the sign of relief appears on the place of pain with a line whose length is half of a digit, or like this: and put your hand away quickly once, and tighten it until you have cut the artery, and keep it until the bone.</start_of_turn
It is necessary to restrain you, so that you do not cause the continuation of the jaw, which moves during mastication, lest it become swollen or the nerve which moves it be damaged, from which results spasm.
Take also great care of the guarding of the artery which has been cut off, and of the flow of blood from it.</start_of_turn> In the cutting of it there is fear, especially for the one who is ignorant of this and is careless and unlearned: he lets the operation go from his hands at the first.</start_of_turn>
And I shall come with the reminder of the regimen of the flow of blood in the event of an accident from the artery, as it is in this book of mine.</start_of_turn>
If you help from the inflammation which is not sufficient for this Cauterium, and if you help the body of the sick man to tolerate Cauterium in the middle of the head, as we have said, take care of the wound, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, administer Cauterium, as we said in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with Cauterium having two blades.</start_of_turn For it is a better cautery which leaves no mark.</start_of_turn
On the manner of cauterizing in the pain of the ears.</start_of_turn
When it happens in the ear a pain from the cold, and it is cured with solutions, and the rest of the cure as we have said in the treatise, and the pain is not removed, then ignite Cauterium: and that is called Punctum, which has this shape.</start_of_turn
Then point with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it is turned: or around both sides, if the pain is in both.</start_of_turn And prolong thee with the Cauterium from the root of the ear downwards, after you have marked the place with the Cautery: and let the quantity of the Cauterium be ten points in every ear, and as much as that.
And then care for the place until it heals.</start_of_turn>
In this way Cauterize in the Tortura.</start_of_turn>
Chapter VII.</start_of_turn>
The Torment which is cured by Cauterization is not except from the kinds which happen from phlegmas, as we said in the discourse of the causes of diseases.</start_of_turn
And you must Cauterize the kind which happens from exication and spasm of the nerve.</start_of_turn
When you have cured this kind of torment with urine, and purging-pills, and hiccups, and the cure does not suffice, then it is necessary to Cauterize the patient three times with the Cautery: once at the root of the ear, and the second a little lower from the ear, and the third at the junction of the two lips.</start_of_turn
And put the Cautery on the side opposite the infirm part.</start_of_turn For the softening does not take place except in the part which appears healthy.</start_of_turn
And the form of the Cauterization is that you Cauterize with the Cautery itself at the tip of the upper ear under the ear-wax of the little horn: and the other at the ear-root. The length of each is as long as the thumb.</start_of_turn And put your hand away with the Cautery, until the quantity of the middle part of the thickness of the skin is consumed.</start_of_turn
This is the form of the Cauter, and it is of the kind which has a blade whose form precedes it: it is not subtler than water in this respect. And the blade must be of such a size as to suffice for the thickness of the tissue.
Then take care of the place where the operation has been made: until it is healed.
As for cauterization in ancient Apoplexia.
When the ancient Apoplexia has become established, and when your treatment has failed, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize four times over every horn of the head, and cauterize in the middle of the head, as we have said, and cauterize in the back of the head, as it has been shown: and the manner of cauterization must be as we have said.</start_of_turn>
The cauterization is also done with the Cauter over the bone of the stomach: and this is the last method.</start_of_turn
Then take care of the patient, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 9.</start_of_turn
It is necessary to give in the first place for the patient barley flour and large pills which soften the brain.</start_of_turn
Then shave the head of the patient entirely, and place over the back of his head a patch of sponges described in the treatise on patches: and put on some of it.</start_of_turn
This is the way of the Cauter: and do it in the order which I have said.</start_of_turn
If he is healed thereby, it is good. If not: then make for him three incisions on the back of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and place between every incision the width of a finger.
Then care for the Cauterium, as before mentioned.
If however you wish to make an addition, and the patient is tolerant of it: then make for him a Cauterium in the middle Which if you wish to make an addition: then cauterize it over two horns
Then care for it until it is healed: and keep the Cauterium oiled in accordance with the form which has been given
In case of palsy and mollification.
Head X.
It is necessary to proceed in the mollification of the head with lye, and as we have said
Then remove the head of the patient: afterwards cauterize the middle of the head, and the horns of the head, and the back of the head, and three on the bones of the neck.
If however you find in the softening of the body by these many, and the patient is tolerant, and the swelling is great: then make four Cauteriums over the bones of the back, and the last one with a Cauterium, until it burns from the greater part of its surface, and lift up your hand Then care for it until it is healed: and keep the Cauterium oiled.
In case of Epilepsy
The epileptic head is not cauterized, except for the one whose epilepsy proceeds from phlegm.
It is necessary therefore that the physician should temper the violent action of the brain in the first place with opium, and afterwards with the other treatments which we mentioned in the preceding chapter: for when the patient is great or suffers from the action of many medicines.
If, however, the patient is young and cannot tolerate the medicines, there is administered a gargling-drink, and biting medicines which temper the action of the brain, for many days before with the restoration of the appetite of food
Then the head is treated with powder, and afterwards the cautery is applied once in the middle of the head, as has been said previously in its kind: and the cautery is applied once in the back of the head, and over every horn of the head there is applied the cautery If the patient should be strong and tolerant, then the cautery is applied with oil, as has been said previously.
If the patient is young, then the cautery is applied softly, as has been said above.
Method of cauterizing in melancholy.
When the cause of melancholy is corrupt humours, and thick phlegm, then the cautery is applied as has been said in the case of palsy
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of wine which leads to melancholy, and the body of the patient is soft and wet, then give him something which will temper the action of the brain, as has been mentioned in the preceding chapter: then treat the head of the patient, and afterwards make a circle from the centre of the head made of linen.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and the sitting patient is held fast from every side.
Then present the unguents. And it is better from old butter or oil And warm it over gentle fire, as much as the finger tolerates when it is introduced into it Then evacuate it in the middle of his head in a circle, and hold it until it is cold
Do this to the patient every week once, with the rest of his treatment being good, until he is healed
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small holes in it, except that you hold the hand with the cautery: for it will smell.
For this kind of cautery hydrates the brain with its quality
Then place over it a cushion soaked in butter, or fat from a chicken
So cauterize in descending water to the eye
Chapter XIII
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared by the signs which I mentioned in the explanation, then begin and pour out the patient, along with what will temper his head
And keep him away from all humilities, and make him sit in a bath, for a few days
Then order him to raise his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his head. Then cauterize it over two temples with two cauteries, if there is an incipient descent of water in both eyes simultaneously: or from one side only, if there is an incipient descent of water in one eye only: and cut off all veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let there be cauteries in them of a length equal to the width of the temples: and burn from the flow of blood.
If you see that anything from it has escaped, then immediately cut it off with whatever medicine is available: and I shall come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting off of them, and the care of the blood flow.
And when it is cauterized on the bone, under two bones, two last cauterizations are produced
In the ancient tears, cauterize in this way
When the tears of the eyes are ancient, thick: and are upon the nails, and the arteries which are in the exterior of the head, it is verified that that is from the superfluities of cold, phlegmatic: then cauterize with the same thing which I said in the beginning of the descending water, the cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries upon the two temporal bones, and two cauteries in the bone under two bones And if the addition does not suffice, then cauterize itself all around carefully around the eye, over the tip of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
In the wound of the nose, cauterize in this way
When you are treating that, with what we said in the instructions, and the medicine does not suffice: then cleanse, and give in the bath of the sick person three nights: then shave his head, and cauterize it with the middle cautery, with olive oil Then cauterize it with the cautery claw with two cauteries, over two superciliums under the hair slightly.
And guard the artery, so that you do not cut it.
This is the form of the cautery of Claudius.
And this is the way of cauterization in the mollification of the Palpebrae.
When the Palpebra of the eye is softened by humidity or by inflammation: then cauterize the Palpebra with a single cautery, like a lunar cautery.</start_of_turn>
And if you wish, cauterize the upper part of the two upper eyelashes slightly with two cauteries at all times: and draw out from two times: and let the length of every cautery be as long as the length of the eyelashes: and do not bring your hand close to the cautery, but according to the quantity which you must take from the third of the Palpebra.</start_of_turn
Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn
There are two kinds of cautery: either with fire or with burning medicine.</start_of_turn
But in the cautery with fire, it is necessary to warn the patient beforehand so that he may expel his hairs, if there are any which are moving, until they are prolonged and equal.</start_of_turn If, however, the patient has them at the root of their eye: then bind his eyes with wool, so that they do not move, until they have healed.</start_of_turn
When they have healed and are equal, then put the head of the patient in your lap: then sign over the Palpebra of his eye with ink, in the form of the leaf of the Myrtle: and let the beginning of the sign be near the eyelashes.</start_of_turn
Then place the soaked cushion in albumin or: on the mucus of the eyelashes above the eye.
Then apply the cautery, which is of this shape.
Then burn over the figure which you indicated gradually in many places, until the surface of the skin is burnt, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, throughout its appearance
And the sign of the completion of your work is: if you touch the Palpebra of the eye with your finger and pull out the hair at the point of the eye.
Withdraw your hand then: and discharge him in three days.
Then place upon it a cushion with butter, until the eschar is eradicated Then care for it with unguent until it is healed.
If some hair should remain after an hour, and the Palpebra be softened: then repeat the cautery over the place as you did at first.
If they are in the lower parts: then burn the area until the hair is raised to its natural place: and make it even so that the hair does not pierce the eye
It is necessary for the sickly person to remove the hair, until they become prolonged and even Make from parchment a shape like a myrtle leaf
Then take from soap that has been boiled, and from burnt lime without soaking from one pound about an ounce and a quarter: then mix these together with a good hand, and make it so that it does not freeze Then take from the end of the vein above the mark which you made like the form of a myrtle leaf, and place it upon the eyeball of one, or two. And place under the eye the soaked cotton in albumin: and the head of the patient be in your hand.
And place your finger on the mark over the medicine, and press it slightly. And you will move it whenever the patient feels the biting of the medicine: because its biting is like fire.
While therefore you have persisted in this, when you find the biting, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger. When the biting has ceased, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And consider then, if the eyeball is relaxed after the expansion, like that which is raised at the contraction with fire, or with incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat over the medicine on the place where the medicine does not touch, without damaging it, until the operation be accomplished, and the eye be contracted
Then place upon it a cotton ball with butter, until the skin of the wound be scraped away Then care for it with ointment of diaphonius, or something else, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you in the operation, that you take care of the last care, that nothing of the medicine should fall into the eye
Because if the eyeball becomes soft after days, and there is something gritty in the eye from the hair, then repeat the medicine on the place where the eyeball is softened by itself, like you did at first. Then care for it until it is healed
This is the form of the Myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men differ in size and shape Therefore, you must take this into consideration: and it is not concealed by the uprightness of the art, which is the study of this craft
As for the cauterization of the fistula of the tear duct
When you have treated the fistula, when you have done what we said in the instructions for the aetiologies, and the cure does not result: then you must cauterize it according to this method.
Command the patient to put his head in your lap, and hold his head between your hands like this, so that it does not move or shake with his head
Then put the sponge soaked in urine or in the mucus of the hair on his eye: then apply the Cauterium, which is of this shape
Let it be concave, like the shape of a feather from its extremity to the other, as Cauterium is made: and if you wish it to penetrate until the other extremity, or if you wish it to be above, do so as you please
It is better to make it concave for your work
Then express the fistula, if it is open, and extract from it the pus, and dry it up: and if it is not open, then open it up, and extract the pus from it.
Then put on it again the Cauterium, which is made burning slightly.
Hold your hand nearby the Cauterium from the eye to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not slip or trouble the patient: and place the Cauterium on the fat of the eye, and consume it.
If indeed you proceed with the Cauterization from the beginning until the bone, it will be well. Or if not: then repeat the Cauterization once or twice if it does not suffice: and discharge it in three days.
Then apply a compress with butter, and care for it with an unguent poultice until it heals.
If after forty days it does not heal: then apply an acute corrosive medicine above it until the bone is exposed: and then proceed according to what is written in its chapter
And there is another method of Cauterization of fistulas, which some of the first men mentioned. Aim at the location of the fistula and find it: then place under the fistula a small cushion, that is, a cannula of a small size, whose shape is this And pour into it the quantity of drachmas of liquid lead, and keep your hand firmly clasped with the cannula, and do not move the patient at all, so that it does not run, or that the liquid lead should not reach his eye
And it is necessary to place over the eye of the patient a compress soaked in fat or in water.
Lead will consume the place of the fistula, and will heal it with a miraculous healing
And if the fistula is healed, with what we have said concerning Cauterization and treatment, it is good Or if not, it is necessary to administer a nose-opening passage, and reduce the fistula to the curvature of the nose, according to what is proper in its own place
On the manner of cauterizing of lip-fissures.
Many accidents occur in the lip concerning a fissure, which are called Pili, and especially in the lips of children.
When you are treating these fissures, as we mentioned in the discourse about ailments, and the cure does not suffice, then you must cauterize slightly with a small knife, according to this shape
And let the cavity be equal to the thickness of the knife
Then put the fire quickly on these fissures until the cauterium reaches the depth of the fissures.
Then care for it with oil until it heals.
Thus cauterize in the fistula of the lip.
When swelling occurs in the root of the tooth, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then pus forms, and it bursts: afterwards it becomes hardened, and pus runs out, and a fistula forms: then you must treat the fistula itself, and not the swelling, then it is necessary to cauterize according to the quantity which is in the fistula Then introduce the fire into the cavity of the fistula and hold your hand, until the fire reaches the depth of it, and the end of it: do this once or twice.
Then care for it afterwards as we mentioned about the cure until it heals
If it bursts spontaneously, and heals, it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to remove the corrupted bone according to what comes to light in the head
Thus cauterize in the gums and soften the teeth.
When the gums are swollen from moisture, and the teeth are loosened, and care is taken with the physicians, and it does not help: then put the patient's head in your lap.
Then ignite the cautery, whose form will appear afterwards, so that you can place the cautery upon the tooth: and introduce the flame into it quickly: and keep your hand steady, until the patient feels the heat of the fire to have reached the root of the tooth
And lift your hand: then repeat the cautery a few more times, as you please.
Then let the patient rinse his mouth with salt-water, and let him rinse for one hour: and then he shall spit it out.
The tooth will now be firm, and the gums will be softened and dried, and the moisture will be expelled.
Thus the cautery is to be used in toothache.
When the toothache is caused by cold, or if the tooth itself is cold or wet, and the treatment does not help with the physicians: then the cautery must be used in two ways: either with butter or with fire.
The cautery with butter is done by taking butter of the kind which is scraped off the calf, and mixing it with the yolk of an egg, and applying it to the tooth with a spatula Then take a sponge, and put it over the end of the tooth. Then plunge it into the boiling butter: and put it upon the painful tooth quickly, and hold it there until it cools: then repeat it a few more times, until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth
If desired, immerse the lancet in butter, or coat the heel in cold butter, and place it over the aching tooth: and place over it a burning iron until the fire has penetrated to the depth of the cavity.
The cauterization of it with fire is useful, so as to reach the air cavity, or the iron cavity And let there be in its body some breadth, so that the intensity of the fire does not reach the sound bone.
Then the cautery, which will take the form of this: place it over the tooth: and hold your hand until the cautery is cold.
Do this quickly, for pain will depart, or in the same day, or another day.
And it is necessary to impress the impression of the cautery, so that it may fill the sick bone with butter, and keep it for an hour: then spit it out
This is the form of the cautery
The cauterize with whatever extremity you will, as is possible: and this is the form of the cannula.
In this manner the cauterizing of the molars.
When the molars are affected by phlegmas, and by cold humilities, and do not obey digestion by medicines, and you wish to accelerate their digestion: then cauterize the cavity which has this shape.
Having two open extremities, so as to escape the smoke of the cautery from the other extremity: place the burning iron over the tooth once, and a second time, if you do not digest it, until it has penetrated to the depth of the cavity
If the fistula is small: then apply the Cauterium according to the quantity of the fistula.
Then discharge it for three days, and place above it a soaked cushion in butter, until it has recovered what the fire consumed
Then care for it with ointment of teeth, until it heals in the form of a tube.
In the swelling of the belly, and constriction of the breath.
When the belly becomes moist over the passage of the wind, and especially when it is with the coldness of the complexion: then it is necessary to evacuate the patient at once with the physicians who are accustomed to such things.
Then cauterize it in the night at the root of the gullet in a depressed place: and burn, do not bring near the Cauterium to the gullet, nor on the skin, except for something of that sort
Then cauterize it with another Cauterium at the juncture of the neck at the end of its last rib: and let the Cauterium be closed according to the mode which preceded it
Then care for it with that which preceded it, until it heals
In the ailments of the lungs, and of the breast.
When there is cough and pulmonary disease from cold humors, and the patient has neither fever nor phthisis, nor old cough: then cauterize it with two Cauteriums above the epiglottis in depressed places, in lenium, in the groove. And another Cauterium in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the Cauterium be in the form of a tube as it preceded.
If one wishes to perform a cauterization by puncturing with the cautery, which is called Punctum, whose form precedes in the puncture of the ear: there should be punctures from thirty punctures up to almost as many.
Then take care of it with that which precedes, until it is healed
And if there is a cautery having three branches: according to this shape Therefore the cautery will be alleviated with that which is done with the three Cauteries when you make it with that liquid one time
Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn>
When the head of the adductor muscle is dislocated due to humidity, and does not settle back in its place within an hour of its dislocation, until it has become accustomed to its retraction, then it should be displaced by a slight movement, as we have testified to this. Then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation immediately.</start_of_turn> Then the diseased person is laid over his back, or on the healthy side.</start_of_turn Then lift the skin which is in the inside of the Titillico towards the upper parts with your left hand: and if the dislocation has gone inwards.</start_of_turn
Then take a cautery having two handles.</start_of_turn Whose form is like this.</start_of_turn
Then cauterize the skin until it pierces the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will appear with four cauteries.</start_of_turn
And when there is a cauterization with a cautery having three handles, because of the shape of the cauterization, there will be six cauteries in its figure: and there are two handles following the sharpness of the attempt.</start_of_turn
This is the shape of a cautery having three holes.
When one adds this to that mode one, there are eight cauteries in all
Then put over the cautery the fat pigs with salt. Then make fast the sick man calmly, so that he does not move the limb for some time, until he is comfortable
And if the dislocation is towards the upper parts, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it upon the humerus with the hook cautery, or with many punctures
For the connection will be firm, and the moisture will be driven out: and the sick man will be healed.
Method of cauterizing the stomach.
When cold and much moisture are brought into the Stomach, until you have extracted it from its complex, and multiplied the catarrh upon it, and applied the methods of treatment diligently, and do not fear: then it is necessary for the sick man to lie upon his back, to extend his limbs, and to stretch out his hands Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the pectoralis angle measuring the quantity of one finger with a hook cautery, and two lower ones from two sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular And lengthen between each other so that they do not join, when they produce pus.
And the depth of the cautery is the quantity of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin
And let the figure of the cauteries be in this shape without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape: and let the cautery be as this one which makes this cautery to be one according to the shape of the circle according to this shape
And it is cauterized with the stomach punctured, that which returns from this cautery: and it is, that signs above the stomach puncture according to quantity, as much as with encasement: then cauterize itself with the cautery of the puncture: then care for it with the care which preceded until it is healed.
And so it is cauterized with the cold [cautery].
When it happens in the Epate that there is pain from the cold and humidity, or from great wind, until it departs from its natural composition through excessive evacuation, and the infirm is cared for as we have said, and does not increase in it: then it is necessary that the infirm rest upon his belly, and signs with three cauteries according to this figure and this quantity over the Ep below the hypochondria, where the elbow of a man rests: and let there be space between every cauterization according to the breadth of a finger: and let the cauterization be according to the length of the body's rectum: and do not press your hand too much with the cautery.</start_of_turn>
And let the quantity of the latter be such as that which is absorbed from the thickness of the skin, without adding the middle quantity: and let the infirm be standing upon his feet.</start_of_turn
If he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who has extended his limbs and raised his arms.</start_of_turn>
This is the form of the cautery.</start_of_turn
And indeed it is possible that these cauteries may be made with a knife when there is subtlety and prudence in the art.</start_of_turn
And take care that you do not go too far in the cautery, and that you burn the entirety of the skin, because the body is thereby burned throughout, and reaches the intestines: for the skin there is thin, as you know.</start_of_turn
On the method of cauterizing the liver after-effects.
When this happens, and you are aware of it, if the after-effect is in the liver flesh or its covering: if it is in the liver flesh, there is mild pain and slight swelling without sharpness: and if it is in the liver covering, with sharp pain that extends upwards: know that the physician has become weary of its treatment.
Therefore it is necessary for the physician to rest the patient above the navel Then the figure of the after-effect is placed with the cautery: then the cautery is applied which is readily absorbed by the rays. This is its form And cauterize with one cautery until the whole skin is burnt, and it reaches the fat, until the whole wound is healed: then care for the after-effects until healing is complete
And do not let any other kind of cautery be used except that which is learned in the art of medicine: and by the hand of those who have experience in these matters: for otherwise you will hear of many such operations.
In this case, I would rather leave it alone.
On the method of cauterizing in the pleura.
The ancients say that cautery with the roots of aristolochia should be applied to the cold pleura according to this method. And it is like taking from the dry roots of aristolochia a long root, which comes from it, and be as thick as the breadth of a finger Then immerse the limb in oil: and raise it in fire. Then cauterize with one instrument at the point where the furcula joins the neck, and with two small cautery instruments under guidance slightly depressed to the part which is under the beard.
And also two cautery instruments at the point which is between the fifth and sixth ribs depressed downwards: and a cautery instrument at the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach And three cautery instruments from behind: one at the point which is between two ribs, and two at the two sides of the chest, the lower cautery being at the point which is between two ribs.
And do not press the hand with the cautery, but rather let the smell of the skin suffice.
And some ancient writers say that there are certain men who use a cautery like a rod of iron: they burn and throw it into the place between the ribs, until it is consumed by them to the very end, and comes out whole: as we said in the case of the Epiglottis.
But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear lest the patient should immediately die or that a fistula should occur in the place, which has no healing.
In this way cauterize the Spleen Head as follows:
When you are treating the pain of the spleen, when that treatment which we mentioned in the enumeration of diseases has not produced a cure, then you must cauterize in three ways, all of which are straight forward
One of them is to make three cauteries or four in a row according to the length of the spleen, following the figure of the cautery which we mentioned concerning the liver.
And be between every cauterization the quantity of breadth of a finger, or more or less.
And be the manner of cauterization as we said in the cauterization of the liver equally
And do not press the hand with the cauterization: and let the patient lie relaxed above his back.
And another manner of cauterization is: that you have two rings holding the cauterization, as we said in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus: and elevate the skin which is over the spleen, where the patient's elbow bends: and elevate your elevation as much as the width of the patient's body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the patient's body.
Then insert two rings with the fire alight until when the cauterization has penetrated the skin from the other side: then remove the cauterization: four cauteries will remain
And if you wish to cauterize with another cauterization which has three rings.
Then take care of the cauterization after you have sent it away to emit pus for many days: for it is better to confer than to leave anything remaining from the cure
In the case of cauterization for hydrops.
The cauterization does not fall in hydrops, except as it is burned itself.
When you treat hydrops with the methods of treatment which we said in the section on wound care, and the cure does not appear, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauterizations around the navel, one on the stomach, one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two on the back between the vertebrae, and one in the centre of the chest, and one in the centre of the abdomen: and let the quantity of depth of the cauterization be close to the thickness of the skin
Then discharge the opened cautery, so that pus may issue forth over a long period of time.
Do not leave the patient unattended after the cautery has been used: for two intentions must be applied to him at the same time: and it will hasten his recovery with the help of God.
The shape of the cautery which is to be used for the belly is like a nail: as it has been previously described; and that which is to be used for the back is like an olive, as it has been previously described
As regards the cautery of the feet and legs...
When they swell in Hydropsicus, and are filled with yellow water: it is necessary to cauterize over the back of the foot between the heel and the ankle: and hold your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not move it at all
The yellow water will rise up, and the cautery must be in this shape.
Then make on each leg two cauteries at the ankle, and make the cautery with the tip of the cautery: and make the cautery according to the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other above it at the middle of the leg: and make two cauteries over every hip: and discharge the opened cautery without treatment over a long period of time: so that some of the water may remain from it: then care for the limb as we have said before
As regards the cautery in the solution of the belly...
Chapter 5.
When the belly is softened by cold and moisture until the retention and digestion of urine are weakened, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured in the manner of treatment and not by itself: and give the patient the one who tolerates the excessive power of the cautery, then cauterize him with a great cautery over his stomach, according to what has been described in the cautery of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four cauteries around the navel, with a nail-shaped cautery under the navel, and a large cautery over the fat above the loin, or two cauteries.
If the moist humors are excessive, and the patient tolerates it, then burn it with the cautery over the belly and over all the intestines: and perhaps add two small cauteries near the great stomach.
This is a complete and accurate translation of the sentence.
Method of cautery for haemorrhoids.
Chapter 6.
When there are many old haemorrhoids in the rectum, or one, and they are made by gross, cold or damp humours, and are not cured by what has been said, then burn three cauteries over the lower spine below the ribs in a triangular shape, and burn under the navel as if with two fingers
And if you think that his stomach is hardened, and that his food does not digest, and that he vomits fluid from his face, then burn him with a large cautery over the stomach according to what has been said: and burn over the spleen and the other over the tail of the pancreas, with the clamp open for a while: then care for him until he is healed.
Chapter 7
When you excise the carbuncle, then burn the cautery that absorbs the heat Then introduce the burning cautery into the excised carbuncle: and move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood runs: do this once or twice.
If there are many carbuncles, then burn each one individually as we have said Then care for it until it heals, when whatever was given from the unguents has been administered.
If you cauterize it with a great cautery over the burn, that is the last thing to do in treatment.</start_of_turn>
In this way cauterize the fistula in the anus.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XXXVIII.</start_of_turn
When the patient does not obey the section [of the bowel] and the work which we have narrated in its place, and returns from it, perhaps it will heal with cautery.</start_of_turn
When therefore anything happens to a fistula, and it becomes old, pus runs from it, and the putrefied parts become moist.</start_of_turn Therefore it is necessary to explore it with a thin hook.</start_of_turn Then know the extent of its depth with the hook.</start_of_turn
Then make a burn with the cautery, which is like a ray.</start_of_turn Then enter yourself with the burning cautery into the fistula and the amount in which the clamp has entered.</start_of_turn
And repeat the burning of the cautery until all the corrupted parts are consumed, once, or twice, or three times, according to the necessity.</start_of_turn
And keep away from the bowels of nerves, if they are there, or great veins: or if the fistula goes to the body of the intestine, or to the body of the stomach, then keep away from these places altogether.</start_of_turn
Do not do this except when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and think, for it is not penetrating.</start_of_turn
Then care for the place until it is healed.
If, however, the place is sealed and materials are removed from it, and it remains thus for a long time: then you know that it has already healed whole
Or if materials are not removed from it, then you know that it is penetrating, or that bone in its depth is corrupted, or as if that from those things: of which memory will come to the place itself.
In this way the veins are cauterized.</start_of_turn>
When it happens in the kidneys that there is pain from cold, or from large wind, and they are diminished through that from which the patient is suffering, then it is necessary to cauterize them over the marrow over the kidneys, cauterizing every kidney with a cautery claw, of which there must be memory.</start_of_turn>
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the same place.</start_of_turn For there come three lines.</start_of_turn Therefore there are two last things in the cautery.</start_of_turn
In this way the bladder is cauterized.</start_of_turn
When there is weakness in the bladder, and softening from stones and humilities, until the patient does not retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the belly above the bladder, where the hair of the testicles begins, and cauterize from the right side of the belly, and from the left side of it: and let the length of this cautery be as much as the thumb node: and cauterize it with a lower burn, or with two burns, if you like: and let it be according to what preceded the cautery claw.</start_of_turn
On how to cauterize the Matrix.
When cold and moisture are present in the Matrix, and it is hindered by that from receiving impregnation, and its menstrual flow is corrupted, and its progress is delayed, and there is pain in its vicinity, then it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel, as we mentioned in the cauterization of the uterus, and cauterize above the lower cartilage of the loin, or perform two cauterizations: and let the cauterium be blunt.
On how to cauterize the Ancham in dislocation
When moisture of the mucous is exuded at the foot of the Ancham, and is the cause of its displacement from its place: and the sign of that is when one limb hangs longer than the other when compared with the limb at the same level: and the place of dislocation is found in that cavity
Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the diseased part above the foot of the Ancham with a cauterium of a circle: after which you must draw a sign around the circumference of the foot: and let the foot itself fall in the middle of the circle
If you do not have this type of cauterium, then perform three cauterizations with a large olive cauterium: and make the depth of the cauterization according to the amount of thickness of the skin of the whole body.
Then take care of it until it is healed
On how to cauterize in Sciatica
When pain occurs in the bone of the ankle, and the cause of that is coldness and moisture: the physician must treat the patient with that which we have mentioned in the treatise, and not otherwise; for it will vanish. Then it is necessary to remove the patient from the humours by means of foul pills, or artificial pills, or the like. Then cauterize it.
And the mode of cauterization in this is by two methods: either with a cautery with burnings, or with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of them is that one should cauterize over the bone of the ankle itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form. And make the depth good, or bad And there should be space between every two cauteries equal to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be round
When, however, the cautery is made in the middle over the bone of the ankle itself. Then there are four cauteries.
And if you cauterize in a circle, whose shape precedes the form of the dislocation of the ankle, one: so that it should contain the whole ankle
And burn the thickness of the whole skin
This is the mode of cauterization in Sciatica, when the pain is adherent to the ankle itself, and does not extend up to the knee and leg
If, however, it extends up to the knee and leg, then cauterize with two cauteries over the knee, over the place where the patient feels pain there, and cauterize your fourth finger towards the heel: and let the cautery be triangular
The depth of the burn should be in accordance with the depth of the blistering of the skin.
If the patient complains that the pain extends up to the toes, then burn there where the burn of a point, or a triangle, or a square, or many, is sufficient for that area.</start_of_turn>
If he complains of pain under the knee, then burn there with a single lancet.</start_of_turn>
In all your burnings, take care that you do not reach the nerves or great artery, and that you do not cause any lasting damage to the patient's body.</start_of_turn>
I have seen one who was burned on the thigh by those who were burning above the knee, and they completed their burning, and the limb became swollen, until the foot was completely black, and all was perforated and corrupted. Then there followed solution of the belly and death.
If there is pain in two parts together, burn both of them in the same way.</start_of_turn>
And some wise men have said concerning the burning of an abscess that this is its manner.</start_of_turn Make a mark like that of iron, whose diameter is half the palm: and let it be at a distance from the orifice equal to the thickness of the thumb nail, or less. And within this there is to be a third part like itself.</start_of_turn
And there should be space between every mark equal to the quantity of the thumb joint: and let the marks be opened from two parts: and let their height be like a knot, or two knots. And make a handle of iron well adapted to the marks.</start_of_turn
Then it is ignited in fire until it turns red, and shoots sparks: then it is placed upon a cushion over the painful side resting on the sound side. So it is cauterized with three round cautery instruments in one vessel.
Then it is left for three days. Then it is plastered with butter: and the wound is opened for many days. Then care for it with unguent until it is healed
Albucasis says, with regard to this kind of cautery, of the sons of the physicians, we use it little, because of its fearsome appearance: and because of this, few expect it over it
But indeed from the good cautery instruments it has its effect on him who uses it, and finds its place with it
The cautery, however, with the physicians who are burned by it, is like two companions who have a perforated arm, in which the heart of its vein comes out from the air, or from iron, the length of the wall: of which two knots or as many as are in their height.
And let there be space between each of these quantities equal to the thickness of a finger, and let there be an opening below and above: and let them contain themselves inside, according to this form.
Then place it upon a cushion over the painful side resting on the sound side And compress your hand over the cushion much Then pour between two circles of lukewarm water, which is warmed with fire a little, and keep it for an hour: and the patient will endure the biting of it, and even its touch, for indeed he finds biting like fire until it rests.
Then elevate your hand with the instrument, and draw hot water from the whole basin with sweet water: then let it go for three days.
And put butter on it, until the black of the wound has subsided: then let it go for a few days, and pus will come out of it. This is the ultimate remedy.
Then care for it with unguents, until it heals.
If the pain extends up to the hip or the thigh: make for it a basin containing water, as you did in the basin before
This is the way of hot water: and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali, and burnt lime ground together in equal parts: there should be two of each: and put them into a new basin, the lower part of which is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity of the radius: and put under the bottom of the basin another basin filled with water: and pour over the alkali and lime sweet water, which should cover both by a finger: and when you have pressed them with your hand with a good compression: let the basin go, until the acute water of the lower basin has descended.
Then gather up the whole water, and pour it over another lime: and cool, until it recovers
These are indeed strong and acute, which are administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of the rest of the limbs. Because it makes the operation of fire itself
And among the physicians, when they cauterize the basin, even as for testicles, and mastic, and nails, and lime with soap, it is so that both are mixed together.
Galen also reports that an ancient physician treated a wound of the anus and a sciatica: and praised his skill. He also says that no other treatment was needed, and that it was healed by means of a single bath.
He is accustomed to take from the beard of a young man: if one cannot find one of these, take fat, pure and mixed: and apply it to the anus, where the pain is, or to the thigh or hip: and bind it, and leave it for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels relief from the pain Then put him into a bath.
When his body is soft, put him into the bath. For the pain departs, and he is healed
And you know that no other caustic should be used with these medicines, except after the evacuation of the body.
Dioscorides also says that the dung of goats, when burned with vinegar, brings relief to a sciatica: and it burns in this way. Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and apply it to the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and is closer to the heel
Then take the dry goat dung and burn it.
Then put it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished. Do this again. Do not cease doing this until the sense of pain has passed away from the anus, and rest has been taken from the pain
And this method of cautery is called the cautery of Vaccinum.
Of the cautery for the pain of the back
When there is pain in the back from many causes, or from a wound, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter: and the cautery is not useless, except for one kind alone, which is made from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary therefore after evacuation of the patient with foetid pills, and things like these, to make three lines across the back where there is pain, as wide as the breadth of the palm of the hand, and to burn with the cautery five cauteries in every line, or more according to the tolerance of the patient or the extent of his pain: and to make the cautery with the point of the cautery
And if you will, burn three or four cauteries with the middle cautery point, according to this form.
Of the way of cauterizing in the hernia of the abdomen
This disease often happens to young children.
And the sign of its inception in children is: when there is a stricture in the bellybutton with vomiting and elevation, and movement: and you will find it in the last vertebra of the back and the nodes of the back, which begin to bulge out over the rest of the vertebrae
When you see this, and if you wish to make it better, then burn it with the cautery which is in the shape of a circle according to this form.
Capture the cautery over every part of the spondilis equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the circumference of the spondilis with the cautery, make two or three lines, and let the points be close to one another.
Then take care of the place, until it is healed as we have said.
And be careful, do not apply the cautery to the swelling, which is caused by a spasm of the nerve.
In the case of podagra and joint pains.
When the pains of the joints are caused by cold humors, which flow to every part of the body, and when they affect the feet, it is customary among physicians to call this podagra
When it is cured by cold causes of podagra, with the methods of treatment, and not by removing the pain, then the cautery will remove them
And it is necessary to cauterize after evacuation around the joints of the feet with many cautery instruments: and let the cautery be of Olive oil
And if you do not wish to make holes on the face of the foot, then make them with the cautery at the points When the pains rise up to the knee, or affect the other joints, and this happens often, then cauterize over the whole knee with three or four cautery instruments, using the same cautery of Claudius
If necessary, do it more often with this cautery Do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather keep the thickness of the skin around it
If, however, pain ascends to the knee and back: then administer what we said concerning cautery in its chapter.
If pain is only in the hands: then prick around the focus of the nails, as two lines are unrolled.</start_of_turn>
If pain remains in the toes: then prick throughout, over every node and over the palm of the hand.</start_of_turn>
If pain ascends after a day to the cubits or arms: then cauterize both from every part.</start_of_turn
And do not make the patient worse by improper treatment or neglect of medicines.</start_of_turn> For if good treatment is done and the phlegm is evacuated, healing will take place with the help of God along with this cautery.</start_of_turn>
¶ Regarding the cautery of ruptures.</start_of_turn
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicles, and it is imminent: then it is necessary to expel the patient from the diet for a day.</start_of_turn And let him use gentle food, from which the stool will descend from its belly.</start_of_turn
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and command him to hold his breath until the bladder or intestine comes out, or until it appears.</start_of_turn
Then reduce it with your fingers, and sign with the cautery under the rupture over the bone of the pelvis, with the sign that its extremity is similar to half the circumference of the body.</start_of_turn
Then the cautery is applied, its form being such that it shall remain white until it has approached its target, and shall emit sparks. Then the intestine, or the bladder to its cavity Then the hand of the minister is placed over the place, so that the intestine does not escape: and you have opened between the ribs of the patient, and placed under it powder, and a servant over the ribs of him, and another over his chest which holds the hand.
Then the cautery is placed upon the very sign, your hand with the cautery being held straight And hold it there until you reach the bone: or repeat it with it another time if you have not succeeded in reaching the bone from the first attempt until the bone itself
And cautiously observe the escape of the intestine during the process of your cautery, that you do not burn it, and that it escapes through that over the patient or the blood, or great harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is in vain.
And it is necessary that the cautery be fine for infants, according to their measure
Then take care of the remaining parts, until they are healed
And let the patient rest upon his back for forty days, until the wound is healed
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment during the time of his recovery, which will soften his bowels: that the intestine does not escape from its place at the concavities and evacuation.
Then when you wish him to rise after forty days, then manage the loosened ligament and keep it for another forty days
And they do not return from work, neither from the repletion of food and drink, nor from the use of strong medicines.
When one uses this regimen, the body is healed whole
And I shall say that the treatment of ruptures is with an incision in its chapter.
When, however, the ruptures happen in the rest of the belly and are beginning, and one wishes that they should not be added, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let that which is cauterized be as much as three-fourths of it. Then care for the itself, as we have said: and do not add to it.
And some people say that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
When it has been signed with the cautery, and a line is drawn which is along the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line is drawn to the lower side And put your hand in the middle with the cautery clamp
But the first cautery is easier and better
In the case of pains caused by falling or percussion.
Chapter XLVIII.
When in some limb there is pain from a fall or percussion, and the pain persists for a long time, and does not yield to treatment with physicians: then it is necessary to cauterize with a Puncti cautery
And the cautery must be of the size of the limb, and of its proportion, and of its flexibility, and of its toughness, and of the twisting of the part, and of the pain from it
If he has recovered from the first cautery, it is well. If not: then repeat over the said cautery.</start_of_turn>
For the custom of these aches is that they change from member to member approaching them.</start_of_turn> Therefore you must follow them with the cautery until the patient has recovered.</start_of_turn>
About the manner of cautery in Lepra.</start_of_turn
Leprosy, however, sometimes requires great cautery.</start_of_turn And especially the kind of Leprosy which is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: with such a kind you must consider the cautery itself.</start_of_turn
If the Lepra is not serious, and you wish to do something with it as we have said before, and it does not progress: and times over the patient, which includes corruption over his whole face: then cauterize him over the head five times: one in the middle of the head known as the nuchal, and the second below it facing the front near the end of the hair, and two over the two horns, and one behind the earlobe.</start_of_turn
And lastly touch your hand with the cautery lightly, until you leave an imprint in the bone, and the cortex is fractured: so as to alleviate the emission of foul vapors from it. And cauterize also over the spleen as before.</start_of_turn
If however the Lepra is scattered over the patient and appears obvious: then you must cauterize with these cauteries which we have mentioned in the head, and a cautery over the tip of the nose, and two over the two cheekbones, and two over the collarbones, and six over the vertebrae of the back, and one large one over the fatty tissue at the base of the buttocks and one over the middle of the thigh: and two over the armpits: namely one over every armpit, and two over the knees: one over every knee, and two over the upper arms, and two over the elbows, and two over the chest.</start_of_turn
And take care of the nerves that are above the heel, so that you do not burn them.
When you cauterize with the cautery above the anklebone, and also above the stomach bone, and also above the spleen.
Know that the more you add cautery, the greater the bleeding, and the greater the risk of harm
And you know that the sickly man does not feel pain in the cautery, just as he does not feel it in health: because his body is already stunned
It is necessary that the cautery be of moderate size, and of smallness in accordance with the parts and the joints: in accordance with what precedes from the kinds of instruments.
Then take care of the cautery from the flour of herbs with honey, and the rest of the treatment, until the patient is healed.
In this way, cauterize in the groin.
When some limb is stiff, and is being treated with physicians, and oils, and plasters, and it does not heal, then cauterize the stiffened limb with cautery, according to the greatness of the limb or its thinness
Let your cautery not go through the thickness of the skin lightly Then take care of it with unguent until it is healed
When you cauterize anything of stiffness of the hand, and the foot, on the spine of the back near the exit of the nerves that move that limb: and you will remove the stiffness.
But do not be proud of this, except for one who is learned in the anatomy of the limbs, and the exit of the nerves that move the body
How to cauterize in Albaras.
When Albaras has hardened, and no oil from the surgeon's art remains in it: then cauterize above with a deep-seated cautery, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the white is removed, and the colour changes.
Then care for it with barley flour, lentils with oil of rose, and leaves of arnica, and blood from columbine, and blood from hyacinth: from each take one part: mix all these things together, and smear over the wound, and bind in place, until healed
How to cauterize in Cancer
When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it returns
But some wise men say, that the last cautery should be in the middle.
I do not see that. Because I fear that it will ulcerate: and I have seen that happen many times.
It is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we have said: or with multiple cauteries.
How to cauterize in Adubelati
When anyone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturity, or because of excessive fatness, or because of age which is feeble, or because of time, and wishes to hasten the maturity of Adubelati: then cauterize around its circumference with many small punctures Then depart from it. Then depart from it. For it will hasten with maturity
If however you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then ignite the cautery, which has this shape.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelat, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the diseased, in order to soothe the course of the pure blood
Then care for it until it heals.
Thus cauterizing in a soft ulcer.
Chapter 14.
A soft ulcer is not except a corruption in a movable limb, and corrupts it: just as fire consumes dry wood
If therefore you wish to cauterize the soft ulcer in a place where you can use fire with the cautery, then ignite the cautery with many small and large sparks, according as will be convenient in the place where the soft ulcer is
Then cauterize it from all sides until you have removed the whole corruption, and let nothing remain of it inside
Then depart from it for three days, and place upon the cauterized place sulfur which has been ground with oil, until all the eschars have been eradicated, and all the corruption is gone
Then care for it with nourishing unguents which generate flesh
If therefore you see that after three days new flesh has been born which is healthy and has no corruption, it is good
And if not: then repeat the cautery over that which remains from the corrupted places.
And the soft ulcer is treated sometimes with acute medicine. The fire itself arises from the place of the cautery.
The fire itself arises from the place of the cautery.
The fire itself arises from the place of the cautery.

Then release it [the clot], for the bladder is erased with its roots.
Do so with one hand after the other, until you have gone over all that is in the body from hand to hand
Then care for the wound after it has been eradicated, when it generates flesh from its roots.
Regarding cautery in Tremore.
When it happens to anyone to have a tremor from cold in the nerve, or from a quartan fever, or from something else: then it is necessary to cauterize it four times with the cautery, or five on the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra cauterize, and in its belly cauterize, and on its stomach cauterize.</start_of_turn>
The tremor will rest with olive cautery, and the health will quickly recover from cold sickness.</start_of_turn
Regarding cautery of the Albathir.</start_of_turn
Chapter 67.</start_of_turn
When there are expelled from the body of the Albathir pus-like boils, which are caused by corrupted thick matter.</start_of_turn
It is necessary therefore in the first place when they appear to cauterize over every head of the boils with fine cautery with a twig of myrtle whose extremity is kindled with fire.</start_of_turn Or with the root of long aristolochia.</start_of_turn Or with lenticular cautery.</start_of_turn
And when they have been cauterized enough at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they do not increase: they break through the superabundance making the swelling cease, and they are healed from the residue.</start_of_turn
Truth be told, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with a bloodletting.
In the flow of blood from the artery to the wound, cauterization must be done.</start_of_turn>
Many times, blood flows from the artery that has been cut at the wound, which occurs either externally, at the incision of the skin, or by cauterization of the limb, and the like: and this makes it difficult to close it.</start_of_turn
When this happens to anyone, then do as I have said concerning the orifice of the artery, and place your finger over it: and tighten it much, until the blood is held under your finger and does not flow out of it.</start_of_turn
Then put in the fire a small piece of olive oil cauterium, and many in number: and blow over them, until they are ignited gently.</start_of_turn
Then take from among these one, or a few, or many, according to the wound and the place where the artery is ruptured, and place the cauterium upon the wound itself: and when you have moved your finger away quickly, hold the cauterium until the blood is closed.</start_of_turn
And if it comes out with the finger from the orifice of the artery, and you extinguish the cauterium, then take another cauterium quickly, from those which are prepared in the fire.</start_of_turn
Do not cease doing this until the blood is closed.</start_of_turn
Take care, lest you burn the nerve that is there, and do not add any other harmful thing to the wound.</start_of_turn
And know this, that when blood flows from an artery, it is impossible to clamp it off: especially when the artery is large, except with four fingers. Or as with a cautery, as we have already said. Or by extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, the extremities recoil, and the blood is cut off. Or it is bound with a strong ligature Or there are placed above it medical instruments which have the property of cutting off the blood, and are bound with a finger constriction
Whosoever performs an excision with a ligature and a tightening with a bandage, or by position of the burning things, and the like, does not give it sufficient pain, except rarely.
If, however, this happens to anyone who has no physician or medicine present: then he should take hold of the tip of the index finger over the opening of the vein, as we have said, and constrict it downwards, until the blood is overcome from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery itself And the finger should not be moved, but should be held down with cold water or ice, always, until the blood is congealed, and has swollen, and is cut off
And meanwhile consider whether it is necessary to use a cautery or medicine
Of Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds, and like things.
We have said in the first chapter that all ailments in which it is expedient to use a cautery or burning medicine, and the occasions, causes, and instruments of these things
And I place the head there from the vertex to the foot.
And I proceed in this chapter in the same way: as when I am treating the cause of the ailment.
Before I begin this, it is necessary to add that which is in this chapter is from the error of the first chapter concerning cauterization
Therefore it is necessary to be cautious in this handling, because in the operation which is in this chapter, there often falls evacuation of blood with the gut, with which there is pain at the opening of the belly, or incision over the swelling, or opening of the fistula, or cure of the wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and these things are similar: from all of which is associated with tremor, and fear, and falls in many of them.
I warn you, do not be deceived by the appearance of ease in this matter, for often they fall to you in this art as in the case of men with diseases like those of women For there is he who flees with his ailment, and is light to you in the matter: because of the great violence of his disease and the length of his suffering And when the ailment is from fear, it signifies death.
And he who gives you his word, and says to you, hoping for your health, while his ailment is malicious.
It is not proper for you to consent to him who comes to you from that side, whose way of life is like this And be more cautious than your eagerness and your impetuosity And do not presume anything about it from that, except after a certain knowledge has been proved to you which confirms that this is the consequence of a successful procedure
And be diligent in the care of all female patients, in prognostication and indication of that to which it is convenient that health should be directed.
For in this lies your aid to the attainment of fame and glory, and the memory and praise.
May God inspire you, son, your intellect, and do not take away from you direction and inspiration: for this is in his hand
And I have ordered this chapter to be distinguished by chapters, following that which preceded in the chapter of Cautery, from the groin to the feet: that you may be able to learn what you wish from it, and for what you desire
Of the care of water which accumulates in the heads of children.
Chapter I.
Know that this ailment often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without gentleness.
And sometimes also from an occult cause which is not known
And I have not seen this ailment in anyone except children: and concerning all those whom I have seen suffer from it, I have seen no benefit from surgery in it.
And I have seen among children whose head was full of water, and the head would swell up every day, until they could not sit on their own because of the size of their head: and the moisture increased until they died
And this moisture is either accumulated between the skin and the bone: or is accumulated under the bone over the cartilage
And the operation in this case, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the swelling is slight, then it is necessary to make a single incision in the middle of the head, of the length of two knots, until the moisture is cured
This is the shape of a sponge.
If there is too much moisture, and the sponge is large, then make two incisions, according to this shape
If the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that the fluid spills out from every part of the head: and the water is drained when you press your hand into the inside, and it does not remain hidden: then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head, according to this manner.
And after the incision, extract all the moisture. Then string the incisions with silk and wool Then suture it up from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then loosen the ligament, and care for the wound with tension and oiling.
And do not make the head tight with the stitches. And feed the patient with little dry food until the limb is comfortable and healed
And another way of making an incision is to consider the size of the abscess and the collection of water
For sometimes it is in the back more, or in the cheek, or in the right, or in the left.
Proceed therefore with the incision where you see the abscess and the collection of water: and cut it according to what you are able to do
And observe, that you do not cut an artery, and there is no excessive bleeding, and the patient dies from that bleeding along with the evacuation of the moisture
Of the incisions of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When any swelling occurs in the eyes or chest, and the same persists, and no remedy befits it by means of medicines: then the last remedy is that of cutting through both of those arteries.
It is necessary therefore when one desires to cut through them, that the patient abate his head. Then let friction be made with rough cloth, that the arteries appear. Then let the patient tighten his neck with whatever cloth he has. Then consider where the pulse is to be found. And the places where both of them are to be found are those which lie under the ears depressed: and they are rarely hidden, except in some men
Then mark with a cautery above each: and cut through both of them with a knife as keen as possible, incision being made to the bone: and do this through the breadth of the head.
And if one wishes, introduce a sponge under the artery, and cut through towards the upper parts with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers
For when the artery is cut, blood flows out with the pulsation, which leaps inside in great quantity.
If however the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary to measure from the ear to the quantity of three fingers' breadth. Then mark with a cautery, and find until the bone.
And that which must be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps more or less is emitted from it The whole of that depends on the quantity which appears to you from the pain of the patient and the distension of his artery.
Consider the wound then. Then if anything remains on the bone from the scraping, then cut that away so that a callous abscess does not form: then bind up the wound with linen strips
Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in temporary pain.
Chapter 3.
When it happens to a man that he has an ancient headache, or an acute catarrh because of sour humours, and heat in the lacerations of the times, or an old soda, or vinegar, or things like these: and it is not to be cured with the methods of medical treatment, then we are experts in extracting arteries from the times, or cauterizing them as we have narrated
And the method of the operation in the extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hair that is in the times, and grasps the apparent artery in the time. It itself is shown to you by its pulse, and rarely is it hidden except in a few people, or because of the cold.
If it is hidden from you, then the patient should bind up his head with anything he has: then rub the place with rough linen cloth Or pour water over the place with hot water, until the artery appears to you visibly Then take hold of the forceps, as I said before the form. Then scrape with it the skin with ease, until you reach the artery Then project the thumb forward into the hook, and draw it out towards the upper parts, until you have drawn it out from the root, and make the thumb lie flat against the tunics which are under it from all sides.
If the vessel is slender: then encircle the thumb with the tip of the hook.</start_of_turn> Then cut away from that part according to the quantity that the extremities extend, and contract, and the blood flow does not increase.</start_of_turn> For if it is not cut away, and if it is not severed, the blood does not ascend fully.</start_of_turn>
Then evacuate from the blood about six ounces, up to three.</start_of_turn
If the vessel is large: then it is necessary that you tie the thumb in two places with a strong thread, from silk: or from horsehair, so that it does not become putrid before the wound is consolidated, and the blood flow increases.</start_of_turn>
Then cut away the excess, which is between the two ligatures.</start_of_turn Do this in an hour, or after an hour.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, burn the thumb with a cautery until it reaches the bone, with a cautery knife: until the extremities of it are severed, and it remains in the place of the work.</start_of_turn
And it is better to do the work if the patient has a fever, or high complexion.</start_of_turn For the cautery is from a substance that dries up humors.</start_of_turn Therefore it is better to suture.</start_of_turn>
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be closed with old cotton: and that some coarse wool be placed above it.</start_of_turn
And afterwards, it is cared for with dry physicians, who make meat to grow, and with plasters, until it is healed.
If during the operation blood flows out from an artery, then it must be immediately cauterized, or that the opening be closed with silk: and hold your hand tight, until the bleeding stops. If nothing of these is present, then place over the place your finger, until the blood clots And bind the place with cold water or ice, until the pain subsides, and tighten according to what is necessary.
And from this it is easier and more convenient to extract the artery, that is to say, that you cauterize the vein with this cautery which has two blades: and let the pain be similar to an almond Indeed they are of much less pain than two blades. For if they are acute, like two blades, they prepare both with cold: and they do not bite the flesh with speed. When therefore in the case of this, there is some extent of thickness, it is held in the hand of the fire, and is severed more quickly: with this therefore work is better in every way, and easier, and more convenient.
This is the form of the cautery.
And let the space which is between the two blades be equal to the thickness of a finger, after you have signed the two points with the cautery: and remove both the flames from the hand, until they reach the bone, and bite the vein in two places: so that it is elongated which is between the extremities of it For with this cautery the vessel is not closed tightly
Concerning the care of acute and persistent eye tears.
Concerning the care of acute and persistent eye tears.
When tears are persistent and there is discharge from the eyes which are above the external part of the head: there is no need for any medical treatment with doctors, and one should moisten the face of the patient so that it becomes red, and he feels himself walking like ants: and his eyes are swollen, wet, because they are corroded by the tears: and the palpebrae are inflamed from the intensity of the tears. Then the ancients said that this treatment would be performed for these operations and they called it Ense.
And it is necessary to pluck the hairs which are in front of his face for the patient Then make three equal incisions on the forehead, according to the length of the forehead: and the length of the incision should be like two fingers, and one incision should be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of the lower part of the wound, and the third from the other side: and take care to avoid cutting any arteries which are on both sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of your two mandibles, and let the space between the incisions be as much as three fingers together: and prepare a sponge or dry cloth with which to absorb the blood.</start_of_turn>
Then introduce the sponge or two acute extremities into the wound, whose following form is like this.</start_of_turn From the incision which is from the temporal part, up to the second incision: and scrape with it the whole skin which is between the two incisions, with sponge, which is over the bone.</start_of_turn And do the same from the middle incision up to the second incision.</start_of_turn Then extract the sponge from this [wound], and introduce into the first incision once more an instrument which is called the cultellare acute, from one blunt end, not from the acute end. This is its form.
And place its acute side towards the meat and the blunt side towards the bone: and press it in, until it reaches the middle seam: and cut through everything that hangs down from the head to the eyes: except that which appears from the skin itself
Then do the same in the middle seam until another incision.
And when blood has drained out an equal amount, express the place from coagulated blood clots
Then put in every incision a piece of old cotton, and put upon them soaked wool plugs in wine, and oil, or vinegar. And see that there is no formation of a cold abscess.
And on the third day dissolve the ligament, and give a large infusion with warm water. Then care for the wound from its base, and leave the rest to heal: until it is healed
Chapter V
Concerning the care of acute tears and catarrh of the eyes from the inside of the head.
When these acute, acrid, and severe tears occur: and you see their eyes extended, parched, and their aspect weakened: and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs falling out from the eye, and acute pain in the depth of the head, causing pain and sneezing: then take away from these causes whatever does not cause tears, for tears alone are not sufficient.
The best treatment for wounds is this. The best treatment for wounds is to scrape off the front of the wound from the patient. Then make an incision in the middle of the front of the wound, or at the side somewhat by its width, and commence the incision from the left side towards the right side: and let the incision reach the bone: and keep your hand away from the wound which moves with chewing: until the bone is detected: and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the wound with cotton wool or strips of linen Then bind up above with sponges: and soak the sponges in wine and oil, so that no blood clots form
And when you have finished with that, and you see that the wound is bleeding excessively: then it is necessary to anoint the bone until new flesh begins to grow in it.
And then care for the wound with the care of drying which makes flesh grow: like if you took two parts wheat and four parts colophony and prepared from them a plaster: and administer it to the wound when the flesh is growing in it
(The provided text does not include the content of Chapter VI, so I am unable to translate it.)
And concerning the care of the wound in the autumn.
Every wound in the autumn falls into four kinds: either a mineral stone, or one like stone, such as iron and lead: or it is of plant origin, such as chickpea and beans: or it is a fluid substance, such as water, vinegar and blood, and things like these: or something that comes from an animal
When a wound in the autumn falls upon a stone, or a kind of stone that does not come from the earth, and does not grow in the autumn, it exposes the autumn to the earth: if you wash away the stone, then distil from the oil of violets or sage something from the vinegar Then manage the extraction of it [the foreign body], and make it firm with pressure, and apply ointment to the nostrils beside the pressure, after you have placed around the circumference of the ear a plug of linen or wool, and extended the ear upwards.
Many things proceed with this care.
If they do not come out, then manage the extraction of it with force, that is, with fine needles: which are of this shape.
If they come out with the pressure, that is good.
And if not, then manage the extraction of it with a blunt needle of small diameter
If they do not come out by this, then make a hole in the ear with a wire, and introduce the end of the wire into the opening of the ear many times, and apply ointment that is around the wire with fat, so that there is no air except for the wire: then draw it out with your hand with strong traction
Many things proceed with this that we have said If it does not come out in this way: then take from barley or from vomit, that is, prepared gluten, with which ducks are caught, with which you should make the head slippery: and put it in the extremity of the radius after you have enclosed over the heel the middle of the bone downwards: then introduce it into the opening of the ear with ease, after you have evacuated the ear of moisture.
If it does not come out with all that we have said, then prepare to break it, before the bone becomes stiff, or a spasm occurs.
And the method of breaking is as follows: as with a phlebotomy of an infirm person in the first place in the skull: and draw out for him from the blood according to the measure of his courage. Then make him sit down between your hands, and support his golden [ear] towards the upper part, and find the opening of the earwax in the root of the ear near the fatty substance in the depressed part: and let the opening be in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the stone. Then remove it with the instruments.
Then remove it with your hand as quickly as possible, and take care of it, until it heals
If anything falling into the ear is from one of the grains which grow and swell: then carry out its extraction.
If it does not yield to extraction, then grasp a thin, flexible sponge according to this shape
And carry out the excision of that kind from the grains that fall into the ear, and do not make it so, when you think that one of them is already softened by the moisture of the ear, until you have put it against many hurdles: then remove it with hooks, or with fine tweezers, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction alleviates it.
However, in water which enters the ear, it is necessary that the patient perform a sneeze with the head downwards: and immediately pour a little warm fat over the ear: and let it rest upon that ear which is in the water If thereby it comes out, it is good.
And if not: then grasp many stones, according to the length of a finger, tight, soft, and warm them with fire: and let the patient put one of his ears into the opening of the ear: and let him spit out one of his toes from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear Do not cease doing this until all the water is expelled
And thus water goes out like this, so that you take from the charcoal or from the sponge one, and introduce its extremity one into the ear: and raise up the other extremity with fire, until most of it is consumed by fire. And do thus again with another sponge, and make this one much larger, until all the water has gone out: and draw out the same with a tube according as it is said in the stone
In the extraction of an animal that is within the ear, if it is small of body, as a flea, and such as it, take care of it as I said in the explanation.
But if it is of great body, which appears to sense: then manage the extraction of it with the hand and with hooks: and thus it is easier for all who hold it in the ear
And when worms are generated in the ear, when you have treated it as we said in the explanation, and in the treatise on distillations, and it does not yield: then it is necessary to burn the ear in the sun. If anything appears there from the worms, then draw it out with the hand, or with fine hooks.
If nothing appears there, then take a tube, which has a narrow lower part and a wide upper part: and introduce its lower extremity into the ear according to the capacity which the sick ear tolerates: then withdraw it with great suction. Do thus repeatedly until all the worms have gone out.
If they do not obey you in their exit, then smear around the circumference of the tube with grease, as I said in the stone
When they do not go out as we said: then manage distillations which the ancient ones are experts in for the extermination of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion be such as that which flows out with oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here. Like wax, which is made from silver or gold, lower it tightly, in which there is a small hole, wide above
Let it be such that the driving force which is in the curvature of the tube is made of air centered And if you wish, take a ball of cotton, and place it at the end of the tube: then pour oil, or gum, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the tube: and let it be in the ear: then insert the ball of cotton onto the cotton and compress it moderately, until the oil is driven into the curvature of the ear, and the patient feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear, let it be already warmed with a little fire: and beware that nothing is distilled in it which is cold and wet: for medicines do not tolerate that.

As for the care of an inflamed auricle.
When some infants emerge from the mother's womb unpierced.
And sometimes it happens to some people that their earwax is in the ear from a wound, or from being born with it.
And this earwax, when it is in the deep part of the ear canal, does not follow usual methods: and when it happens at the outer part of the ear canal, and follows the usual methods.
That which happens in the deep part of the ear, and which does not understand the aspect of it, is in many situations difficult to heal
And as for that which follows the usual methods, it is necessary to put the ear of the patient in the sun, and to press in it: then if you see the apparent earwax, open it with a fine spatula, whose form is this which follows, let its extremity be in which there is a slight width, whose part is acute: and the rest of the spatula should be soft on both sides: so that it does not hurt the ear
If there is a swelling from meat that has risen in the ear: then hold one finger under the ear, and press with ease until the whole flesh is removed.
If the swelling is deep in the ear: then take a slender needle, thread it, and burnish it with fire: then pass it into the ear meat
If you feel swelling with pain, which an infirm person has with difficulty hearing, try to open it with ease: and be careful, lest you damage the nerves of the ear.
Then put into the ear a wick according to the quantity of the hole you have opened in the eardrum: do this for a few days, until you are certain of the healing of the wound.
Or take a wick, soak it in rosewater, sprinkle it over charcoal that has been ground to powder, and use it like that.
If you have put the wick in the ear and it has become loose: then you must take out the wick, and put in another one, which you will put in a vessel containing rosewater, until the swelling has subsided: then care for it until it has healed
If blood flows: then immerse a sponge or bandage in cold water, and put it on the ear: and use the rest of the treatment which expels the blood stated in the treatise on distillation.
Note: The provided text does not include information regarding the care of the eyes, so I am unable to translate this portion of the sentence.
Chapter 8.
These are the Althelis that happen in the eyes, when they are wet, and when they are dry.
You must hold them with pins or with a finger, and press them out with the thumb from their roots Then place above the wound a piece of sponge.
If blood flows from the wound, then cauterize it with a fine lancet.
Cautering is better after the incision has been made. Many things return when something remains at its root When cauterized with fire, those roots burn and do not return
Regarding the care of the large palpebrae of the eye
Chapter IX
Many things happen in the palpebrae of the eye that assimilate with Crandinis in its hardness and its roughness, and because of this it is called Grand: and it is the accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower palpebrae.
The operation is thus done in the eye, as you will consider, if there is a Grand proceeding from the palpebra, which appears from the palpebra and moves to all parts, and this is easy to do
Find thus above the wound along its width Then scrape away from all around with ease, until it comes loose Then suspend the wound with a thread, and cut it off.
If it is not prepared for cutting, namely when you penetrate the palpebra with an incision that is too small, then it will be harmful to the patient in some way
If the incision is large: then gather it with a suture: and care for it until it heals
And if it is small, it will not cause any harm from it The ointment restores itself and nourishes the body.
If it is large, it hangs downwards into the inner part of the ear, then I reverse the eyelid and suspend the large quantity with a thread: for besides that, I do not approve of incision, and I press from all sides.
For if the eyelid is elongated by incision, that does not harm in any way.
Then I wash out the eye after the incision with salt water: and I care for the place with that which nourishes, until the patient is healed
About the care of the eyelids.
Chapter 10.
The secret is a kind of grease which is generated in the upper eyelid: and most of all it happens in children: and it weighs down the eyes of them, and causes them to be blind in the mornings, and they are not able to see the light of the sun, because the tears run down their faces always, and because of that the tears lie over their face always, and over their eyes they are always wet, and their eyelids are always soft because of the swelling: and the prominence of the secret is seen in the eye, and when you press with your fingers, you feel the secret between your fingers.
And the way to treat it is for the patient to put his head on your lap
Then take a piece of linen and prepare it with oil, and make from it a circle according to the quantity which contains the secret from all sides. Then put it on the eye, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the secret is collected in the middle of the circle
Then find in the middle of that humidity with the spatula some slippery matter that has come out during the incision, and do not make a larger wound than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth
Either it is necessary to find the whole skin, until it reaches Axirnath, in various positions, or Axirnath proceeds from a fissure following the shape of a white frothy substance.
Extract the blood from the hand with the towel which you have plunged between your fingers towards the outside: and you will turn your hand to the right and left, until it is scattered: and be careful, lest you should pierce the thumb, lest you should reach the eye, and cause damage to it.
If, however, you do not see Axirnath at the beginning of the fissure, you add in the fissure a little with ease, until Axirnath proceeds. Then extract the blood, as we have said before
Then immerse the towels in vinegar and water, and place them over the place, and bind them with threads.
And from men there are some who wipe away the salt, and put it into the hollow of the fissure, that the moisture which remains from that humidity may liquefy
Then take care of it until it is healed.
If, however, there should happen in the place of the wound a soft swelling, then take care of it with cold packs but soothing, until it is healed
Regarding the methods of treating the eye, that is, when the eyelid is softened, from which it results that the eye becomes red as it should not be.
Chapter 11.
When the hair of the eyelashes has been added beyond its normal course beneath the natural hair, and is excessive: then it does harm the eye, and makes the methods of treatment of ailments such as excessive tears, the softening of the eyelids, and pus, the cause of the destruction of the eye.
The eye inflammation is treated in four ways. Or by cautery with fire. Or with acute medicine, as has been mentioned in the chapter on cautery. Or by incision and stitching of the Ataxmir Or by means of needles, as I shall say
You must place the head of the patient in your lap Then grasp the eyelid of the eye with your left hand
If it grasps it, that is good And if not: insert the needle through the skin at the lower part of the eyelid, and pass the needle along with the thread to the upper part of the eyelid, and grasp the needle with the forceps.
Then find under the added eyelashes inside the eye, with the tip of the needle at the greater lachrymal gland until it reaches the smaller lachrymal gland
Then draw out the thread, and put under the eyelid a small piece of cotton or gauze: then suture over the eyelid with a burn, which should be like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
However, you must know that the figure should be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this varies in different people.
From this it is evident that the quantity which should be incisions from the eyelid is great, according to the quantity which is softened by the eyelid itself.
Then when the eyelashes are found between two lines which you have marked, and you have reached from the greater lachrymal gland to the smaller lachrymal gland, and there is one suture close to the natural eyelashes, like the thickness of a radius
Then insert the hook into one of the two skin angles. Then excise the whole area Then join together the two lips with a suture, using a needle and a fine thread: and drain the blood, and make fast what has protruded from the threads above the two eyebrows, with some useful substance, if you wish to do so: or if not, do not worry
Then remove the suture and the thread for three days, or four: then care for it
And if you wish, remove the swelling without a suture, and care for it with that which dries and contracts it For the eyelids swell up at the sealing of the wound and the gathering of its parts: but this is better in the future
Such is the way of treating Ataxmir, as the ancients taught us
But indeed, in this is solicitude over the sick person, and it is from a good operation, and not from fear.
And another way is in Ataxmir also: and it is that there should appear on the eyelid a sign like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Then elevate the eyelid with three separate hooks, or gathered together, according to the shape of this sign, and then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this shape, with equality of the incision.
If, however, it is not possible to hold the hook, and it does not agree: then grasp the point where the thread is and insert it in the middle of the sign: and insert another thread near the greater lacrimal gland, and a third thread near the lesser lacrimal gland: and join together the threads between your fingers with equality
Then raise your hand equally high; and elevate the skin above that which is signed for the wound, as we have said.
Then join together two lips of the wound with sutures: and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If there should happen to be swelling at the incision or tear: stop that swelling with an ointment, and do the same with things like it, from settled unguents.</start_of_turn>
And when the eyelashes also swell, as their hairs are turned inward.</start_of_turn
It is therefore necessary to use that which we mentioned concerning the incision: but the suture of both is an artificial one.</start_of_turn About care for Ataxmir with a dog.</start_of_turn
And it is, that you cover the eyelashes, and split the tear which is inside, as I have said.</start_of_turn Then make two needles, or two thin sticks: of which the length is according to the length of the eyelashes, and the width of them is less than the width of the pupil: and put the thread through at the extremities of both from both parts where you hold the thread.</start_of_turn
Then join together each one with some substance over that which remains from the eyelash of the eye, and string two needles from both parts firmly, and let go of it every few days.</start_of_turn The skin will therefore be stretched out to die, and will become dark, and will decay, until it falls away by itself.</start_of_turn
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it away with scissors.</start_of_turn Then care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
When the tissue is firm, raise the eyelids: the hairs do not pierce them.
This is the shape of two nails which you make according to this figure and the quantity in length and breadth.
Chapter XII
Regarding the elevation of hairs piercing the eye with the needle
The operation in this is that you take a fine needle and introduce it into the silk thread, which is soft Then you join the extremities of it and make knots at each end with a fine knot: and let the length of the thread be as much as a palm of the hand
Then you make another fine thread and pass it under this one in a short space, and knot the extremities of it if you wish.
Then you place the patient's head in your hand, and it should be near the cheek so that the operation is clear: because the operation is slight, or even almost negligible
Then insert the needle with the thread at the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you have pulled out the natural hair
Then draw out the hair until above the thread: and introduce into the thread the tip of the hair: if there is one, or two, or three, not more
Then draw your hand away with it, until the hair with the thread comes out of the eyelid with the natural hair.
If, however, the thread is drawn out and the hair does not come out with it: draw out the thread to the lower part, with the thread which you made in it, until the thread comes out of the upper hole, and you see the eye: then you draw out the thread and the needle, and close the eye: and leave the eye closed for two days, or three, until the hair has grown back in its place, and has become stronger than before
If the hair is short, either associate with it a long hair from natural hair, and elevate with it: or dismiss it, until it extends after space, and then elevate it.
Chapter XIII.
When this happens to the eye, it is called the Leporina.
This phenomenon is either natural or accidental
Accidental, therefore, is from the consolidation of a wound, or a section, or a cauterization, and the like
And the mode of operation in this is that you find the consolidation, and separate the edges, and place between them a bandage of lint, and bind them together, until it heals
And do not use in the care of it those things which irritate and harden: for if you do, the Alxatrati will deteriorate more than before: rather use those things which soften, such as barley-straw: and embrocate with water in which aloes are boiled, seed of flax: and oil of thyme, which is liquefied with some oil: and mix with it the bandage, and care for it.
And your skill in care is such that you can prepare everything with ingenuity, so that it does not harden, according to the form which it had at first
And this, indeed, is the operation which we have mentioned, is not without some rectification of the Alxatrati, so that it does not return to its original form
Regarding the care of the Alxatrati which happens in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter 123.
The one that is below [the head], which is truly called Alxatrati. And it is natural, and it is accidental.
It is accidental from a wound, or a fissure, or a burn, and things like these
And the way to operate in this is that you take hold of the needle, which has a doubled thread, and pass it under the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal gland until it reaches the right lacrimal gland, until the thread passes through both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut the thread with a wide knife.</start_of_turn> If therefore the figure of the eyelashes returns according to what is required, it is good.</start_of_turn>
And if not, take hold of the radix, and put it in the fissure, and close it with it: and find two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the two ends of the incisions meet at two angles: until when they gather together they make the figure of these letters, and this is the Greek laudation.</start_of_turn>
Then take away the flesh by the amount which is the width of its apex below, from that which follows the eyelash.</start_of_turn Then join the separated parts: sew them with a thread.</start_of_turn
Then care for them as we have said, of soothing medicines, and ointments, until they are healed.</start_of_turn
And if Alxatrati occurs from a fissure, and suture, or burn: then you must find a flat wound under the eyelashes, even as before.</start_of_turn Then separate between the two lips with a linen strip, as we have said.
And thus the sum of the discourse concerning the care of Alxatrati is this: when it is above or below, that is, when it is in this operation, it is done in the form of Alxatrati.
For itself, it is a matter of various forms: and the skillful artist prepares the wit with whatever method he deems suitable, until he makes the figure resemble the natural form, or almost so, even the patient himself, according as it agrees with the operation and the instruments in their various arrangements
Chapter 15.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
When this happens to many people, it is necessary to consolidate the upper eyelid with the white of the eye, and to keep it away from its natural operations.
It is necessary therefore to introduce the end of the radius under the eyelid, and to lift it up: or to stretch it out with a hook: then cut through the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be as acute as the incision of the spatula, but rather obtuse and gentle: so that it does not irritate the patient during the operation, and that the spatula be easily withdrawn, and that the eye be healed with its own sharpness: and that your incision be such that you seem to be merely scraping away the adhesion with ease, until the eyelid returns to its natural shape, and the adhesion is completely healed
Then pour water salt into the eye, when the eye has bled: or distill it from the sieve which you have made, from zinc dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen strip: and place over the eye lanolin infused with alum: and on the third day use the sieve and solid dressings, until it is healed
On the incision of the nail and the elevation of the carnis lachrymarum.
On the incision of the nail and the elevation of the carnis lachrymarum.
You know that the nail is according to two modes. Or it is fleshy: and it is similar to soft wax, delicate Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or when you grasp it with a hook, it is broken off and does not remain in it
And both of these kinds do not begin, except from the greater lacrimal gland, until it has proceeded slowly, until it covers the useful thing, and excludes light and the movement of the eye
And the manner of working in its incision is: as you place your sickly head in your lap Then open its eyes, and elevate the eyelid with your hand Then gather the nail with a hook of a few doubloons, and stretch it upwards. Then grasp the point with a needle, and introduce it into the hair of the horse, and blood, or fat: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle thin, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce the nail with the needle, and ligate the nail with the thread, and stretch the nail upwards: and remove the outer layer of the nail following the pupil, as if you were shaving it with the nail until the last of it
And then cut the remainder in the root of the lacrimal gland with fine scissors, or with small forceps: and release the natural carnis lachrymalis, so that it does not cause excessive flow of tears from its incision
When the nail extends with a single loop: or with a thread, as we have said. Then it is to be pared back with a blunt spatula, whose form is like this
Beware, lest you touch the sensitive membrane of the cornea with the spatula, and cause a rupture, and perforate the pupil.
Then, after the incision, pour some powdered salt or mix it from barley flour, and leave it in for until tomorrow. Then care for it as is necessary, until it is healed
If the nail is neither sensitive nor does it contain marrow within, and if it does not bleed, then it is to be treated with many medicines, and it will heal as I have mentioned before
If you wish to make an incision, then open the eye of the patient, and take out the sharp and fine spatula, of moderate sharpness, according to this form. And remove the nail from above with care and precision If you see that it is becoming pale and brittle, and that it is cracking, and that it has split in two, then wash it out of your eye with barley flour or with red ochre or with salt: and instill the eye with something until tomorrow.
Then repeat the operation until it is complete Except that there is a soft callus in the eye: then leave it in place, and care for the callus until it is healed
Then repeat the operation above with care until it is healed
The swelling of the tear gland, if it causes great pain in the eye, is to be suspended with a loop, and a portion of it is to be cut away: and do not make the incision at the end, lest you cause the tears to leak out
Then stay in the tear duct with a red sponge, or made from spongewort, until it heals.
Since the incision of the Algardene, and the native tissue in the eye.
Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn>
Sometimes in the eyes of men red flesh is composed, or superposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards: and it absorbs the scarlet of the rose petal.</start_of_turn>
And the operation in this also is that you put your hand in his head.</start_of_turn Then open his eyes, and collect all the flesh with the needles which agree with that: and hold that with a forceps or by hand.</start_of_turn
Then cut the flesh first, until you finish all of it with the chisel.</start_of_turn And burn from the eye, so that you do not damage it during the operation: and let your incision be as we have said in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which you collect the fat, as it will appear after this chapter.</start_of_turn
When you have finished your incision, and have moved all the Algardene, then put the eye out from salt mixed with sand: or distill into it some powdered red ochre, and similar things from the physicians of corrosive matters: and put over the eye a bandage of cotton with alum or gypsum: so as to secure it from the heat of the afterburn.</start_of_turn
If anything remains of the Algardene, and you dominate the warm blood, and time the fever: then let go of the eye, and care for it as it lies down the fever.</start_of_turn
Then repeat over the said part with the operation until it is healed.
Do the same with the added flesh as is done with the natural flesh of the eye of that kind
It is necessary to know, that other treatments for all diseases of the eye are excluded from this operation, both natural and accidental, operating with the instruments: and do not introduce your hand into any part of the operation, until you have verified that the limb can tolerate this operation.
On the collection of the fat from the eye
Chapter 18.
The fat is a red wax which covers the eye, and hinders its operation: and it weakens the eye with the length of the days.
Therefore you must first consider, if the eye in which the fat is, is strong, and is not in any other illness besides the fat: then collect the fat from it
And it is necessary to command the patient to keep his head in your lap
Then suspend those waxes with one or two hooks, according to your prudence: and let the hook be of fine wire, doubled, according to this form, or two hooks graduated in one body, according to this form.
Then collect with fine forceps those waxes with diligence, and wash away the blood an hour after an hour, until you have verified that those waxes have been removed from the eye, and have dissolved: and beware lest you wound the eye with the edges of the spatula
And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation so that you do not injure anything except the waxes.
When you have finished [administering the medicine], then distill into the eye a little of the green or red unguent: so that its sharpness may eat away what remains from the wound.
When it is not possible to collect all of that in an hour, then smear the eye with this [ointment], which will soothe the pain of the eye: and leave it for a few days, until the pain has subsided. And keep it away from heat: then repeat the procedure above until the eye is healed.
This is the form of the scissors.
On the reduction of the Arissa to the nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call the Arissa Fistula which is treated with cautery, or with acute medicine which burns, as she has previously mentioned
If it does not heal, then there is no skill in it: except that you should find the abscess at its origin and evacuate all the moisture which is in it and pus, until the bone is clean
When the bone is thus cleansed, and the cavity is filled with corruption or blackness, then seal it up with an instrument of this shape
This is called the Asperation of the head
Make it from iron without a handle, and let its head be round like an egg, which is pierced with the point of a lime-stone, or with the point of an awl or with a fine point: and put it on the place of the corrupted bone.
Then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand lightly, until you know that the corruption is gone: and do this several times.
Then restore the place with astringent substances.
If therefore the locus is solidified and a carbuncle arises in it, and the course of the disease is severed: and it remains for forty days, and does not recur, and does not abate, and does not happen in that place again: then you know that the patient is already healed.
If not, then it is not in that part, except to reduce the swelling to the size of a pinhole, according to this fashion.
And it is thus, that you perceive the second bone with iron, or with acute medicine: and when it is detected, then grasp firmly according to this fashion, whether the outer extremity be of iron, triangular: and its wood be extended as far as the extremity, like urine
Then place that upon the bone itself: and let it be near the tear-duct: and extend your hand from the eye a little. Then withdraw your hand with the instrument until it penetrates the bone, and feel that it is infirm: thereby that you will know that the wound has come out through that, when you keep your hand on your nose
Therefore then restore the place with astringent medicines that exude, as I have taught you.
When therefore a carbuncle arises in the flesh, and the place is solidified: then the matter which flowed outwards returns to the nose: thus indeed is it easier for it to be over the infirmity
On the reduction of the swelling of the eye.
Chapter 20
When the eye swells up completely, and does not yield to any document, neither by diminution: then it is necessary to dissolve the swelling: then perform a phlebotomy: afterwards apply warm compresses to the sky without making an incision, but with suction.
Then apply upon the eye a unguent made from acacia, aloe, oil, and ochre. Then bind over the eye a patch with many feathers
And as for the feathers, take fine wool, many of them, and fold every feather over four: make many of them: then put one over the other, as many as are needed for the eye: then bind over them with a strong cloth
Do it again with gentle pressure without cutting
Then remove the swelling, and keep the eye closed day and night.
If, however, the ligament is again softened, then it must be bound much more tightly: then remove the ligament after a day and a night, as we have said.
If thus you see the eye again redden, it is good: and if not, then bind over the eye again, the feathers, and the cloth, and the swelling, until it is healed.
About the incision of the edge of the eye
Chapter 21.
When it happens that the ligament is ruptured in the eye, then it comes out and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of sand, and is injured in the shape of a man because of this, and one must cut it: then the operation in this is as follows: and it is that you insert a needle into the root of the ligament from the lower part to the upper part
Then insert another needle into which is double thread from the lachrymal part, and make it penetrate: and remove the first needle according to its position.
Then cut the place of the double thread, and bind with it the part of the ligament around the needle: and bind it tightly.
Then extract the [pointed object] and place above the eye a soaked lamb's wool in the albugine or on the wound: and let it go until the thread comes out with you.
Then care for the eye with this, which soothes it, until the wound is healed.
And when you have tied the thread from every part with a circle of cloth, until you have added the eye a great prominence
Then prick with a fine needle under the eyelid, which will reach the depth of the eye, and cover with moisture the albumin, and let the eye go down, and insert immediately: then tighten it up, until it is healed
On the care of the Alcomnatum.
Chapter XXII.
This ailment which is called Alcomnatum, is not anything other than health which is gathered in the eye, like water that descends and is not the ailment itself.
And the way to treat it is to make the patient sit on a prepared seat, or direct him to sit
Then take his head in your hands from two parts and move it until you feel health going down to the lower parts of your eyes Then fix it, and do not let it go down, and close your eyes: and the patient will see as well as before: and if it does not go down below, you know that it is water
If however the descent of health is not prepared with this which we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands. Then take a fine needle and find with it above the cornea the thickness of the conjunctiva with the tunica cornea in a circle, until the health comes out.
When the patient departs, then distill into the eye a warm water in which was mixed honey: or water in which you have cast barley groats and honey: then care for it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Concerning the care of water which descends into the eye, or a cataract.
This section of the text is not included in the provided text, so I am unable to translate it.
We have spoken of ten kinds of water which are useful in eye-drops, and which are declared and explained by the prescriber, then take that which is most suitable for the healing.
Then you must make the patient sit between your hands square, opposite the light, near the lamp: and bind his eye firmly: then take your right hand, if the eye in which the water is, is the left eye: or take your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then take your right hand almond-shaped, if the eye is the left: or your left hand, if the eye is the right
Then place the tip of the almond near the edge of the pupil over the smaller part of the apparent white of the eye: then push the almond with force: and you will draw back your hand until it penetrates the membrane of the eye: and you will feel that the almond has reached the bottom of the eye
And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the almond be to the depth, the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the black part: and is the rim of the eye You will see this in the pupil of the eye by the clarity of the cornea.
Then put the almond in the place where the water is Then let the lower part of the wound be closed after the upper part.
If water descends immediately, the patient will suffer great damage above that which opened wide immediately, and the wound will be swollen in his eye.
Then rest a little while. If water descends again, then take hold of the wound a second time, before the swelling comes out.
When it has subsided, and does not ascend: then draw out the swelling with ease: and you will rotate your hand slowly.</start_of_turn>
Then dissolve in water something of clear salt of the seed: and bathe with it when the eye is closed.</start_of_turn> Then put over the eye the whole bandage, or wool soaked in warm oil, and alum: and tie with it the sound eye.</start_of_turn
But we, and those who are of our time, put upon it a coarse plaster with alum.</start_of_turn
If it does not obey you, the swelling at the entrance of the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is hard and cold: then you must take hold of the sponge, which is called Alberid, which has this shape.</start_of_turn
Pull it out with the sponge together with it, and do not twist your hand in the hole: and do not omit that you make a little opening for the swelling.</start_of_turn
Then introduce the swelling, as we have said.</start_of_turn
And in addition to this, prepare for the patient a comfortable bed, made in the center, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room: and be kept away from all movement, and from coughing: and give him food that softens the nature of his condition: and do not move his head to the right or to the left at all.</start_of_turn
And let the ligament be according to its usual position until the third day.
And then dissolve it in that dark place, and experience its effect: and make it help the matter And reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
And it must not be done in the hour of treatment, or immediately after incision: but it must be done at some other time, for otherwise the water will ascend too quickly through the swelling area
If however a cold abscess occurs: then it must be dissolved before the seventh day: and rectify it with that which settles the abscess, until it is settled: then dissolve its cause, and put on the oral bandage which should regulate its effect under that place for a few days, while it still exists in that dark place
And then gradually depart from that place and return to its own case.
And know this, that in the field of surgery the pupil must not be absent for a long time: for otherwise he will hear about the operation
And indeed some of those from Alayrach have told us that in Alayrach a great magdanz was pierced, from which water suggets.
But verily no one in our land has done this: neither have I read of it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is new
And these are the forms of the spirits of magdanz, as they remain over those who do not know them.

Chapter 24.
On the care of the native flesh in the nose.
When the native flesh of the nose has been cut by various instruments, there is something which is absorbed by the scorpion's feet: from this there is a cancerous tumor, a stone, and flesh of a dusky color: from this there is what is soft flesh, not of a dusky color.
Therefore, in that which there is soft flesh, not fraudulent, neither cancerous, you must make the diseased part rest between your hands facing outwards, and open the nose through its opening, and push out the tongue into those flesh: then draw them out to the exterior, and cut away what you have seen with a fine sharp instrument from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed
If anything remains of that from whose excision is impossible: then cut it away with a fine instrument with ease, until nothing remains of it If blood therefore dominates, or if there is a thick clot: then oppose it with something which will stop it: or with bad clots, then burn them with the cautery, until the blood is stopped, and remove all the flesh.
Then throw into the nose after the incision of the flesh, water or liquid. If the nose is opened, and there is humidity coming from it until the palate, then you know that it is healed
If indeed the humidity does not penetrate, according to what is proper, then you know that there is still native flesh in the upper bones of the nose, which has not been removed with the instrument during the incision
Therefore you must introduce a thread of fine caliber which has some thickness to it, and tie a knot in it: and place between every knot the quantity of digit, or less: and cause the diseased part to bleed, by sending one end of the thread into the nose with a hook, or in any other way that is possible for you to do after you have made it similar to a burn: and draw out the foul matter until it comes out to the outside, and go out from under the chin.
Many do like him in schools, just as the young Attomus: and it is easy for him who wishes.
Then place two extremities of the child, one that projects over the nose and the other that remains in the nose And hold the flesh closed with knots that are in the limb. Do this until you know that the flesh is closed with knots in the limb
Then draw out the thread: and put in the nose after draining blood the amount that you drank in the Egyptian unguent: do this three days, or more, until the unguent has eaten away all that remains of the flesh
Then put in the end of the matter in the nose a lead cannula for a few days, until it heals.
If, however, treatment is required that demands it, use it.
For the head wound, when oil and other medicines are distilled in the nose, do this from silver or from lead: and let it be like fine pepper, open like a conch, and similar in size
And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a tube
The tube of the instrument for making the head wound is full, closed: which has a handle in its rear, with which you grasp it, when you heat it in oil, or when you wish to put some ointment in it, and in the fluxes.
Head wound.
Many are born in the extremity of the Thelulean nose, and grow large, and increase with days, until the wound becomes like its appearance
And therefore it is necessary, that in the commencement of its apparition, it should penetrate all its tissues. Then place above it, or cauterize, or apply a burning medicine which is in its place.
If, however, its incision is delayed until it has increased in size, then consider whether it is stony, hard, dark brown, insensitive: then do not touch it with the iron: for the tumor is cancerous
Many therefore are the waters which issue from the tumor, which is the cause of great malice above that which it has had
And if the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark brown, and the waters which issue from its incision are possible throughout all of it, then evacuate the patient, and cut it without fear, without pain: and care for the place which exudes and contracts, until it is healed
Chapter XXVI.
Concerning the suture of the nose, and the lip, and the ear.
You know that when resolution of continuity takes place in some cartilaginous matters, it causes little in that operation, except in some men.
It is necessary therefore, when anything has happened from this, that you consider whether it is a wound which has adhered with its blood: and then join the two edges of the wound with suture: then care for it until it is healed
And if the resolution of continuity of the lips has already been separated, and each part is sound: then it is necessary to strip away every part from its apparent skin, until the blood clots Then join the two lips with suture, and string them, and smear above it the blood of a dragon, and olive oil, finely ground: and place above the ground the edge of a plaster of Paris, and any other solid plaster: and leave it bound for two days, or three Then loosen the thing itself, and change the medicine: and discharge the thing, until the threads are severed by themselves. Then take care of the thing with the unguent, until it is healed.
The way of stitching is that you gather the solution of continuity together, or with an obtuse angle, as we say in the gut suture: or gather the solution together with the thread, as you have been told.

Then put over the place a little sponge, or other powdered astringents.</start_of_turn
If it returns again to its original state after treatment, for it returns often, then cut it again in the second instance and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.

Concerning the reason for teeth decaying with iron.
When they gather together on the surfaces of teeth from both inside and outside, and between the gums, their outer layer becomes rough, dark, and sometimes they decay, and black spots appear, until this corruption reaches the gum and causes the teeth to become loose.</start_of_turn
It is necessary therefore that you make the patient sit upright between your hands, and hold his head in your lap, and move the tongue and the teeth, in which you see the outer layer, until something remains of it, and in the same way make of black spots, and yellowness, and brittleness, and other things until they disappear.</start_of_turn
If therefore you remove what is in the beginning of the cause, that is good: and if not, then repeat the treatment on it every other day, second day, and third day, until finally the study of the thing is completed.</start_of_turn
You know that teeth need different rasps of various forms, many figures: according to the preparation of your operation: because the rasp with which the tooth is rasped from the lower part is different from the rasp with which the teeth are rasped between, according to other forms.</start_of_turn
And these forms of rasps are prepared for you, which you will use.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXX.</start_of_turn
Concerning the extraction of wisdom teeth.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary that the dentist remove the tooth from its pain with all his skill, and afterwards to eradicate it. It is not in his power to remedy the pain of the tooth when it is eradicated: for it is a sublime substance. Therefore, when there is no other remedy for the eradication of the tooth, it is necessary to eradicate it, even if the patient dislikes it, in order to establish his health and give him confidence concerning the painful tooth.
Many patients dislike the patient when he eradicates the tooth, thinking that he thereby removes the cause of the pain. But the pain does not vanish until the diseased tooth is eradicated.
We do not wish to be like those who are skilled in phlebotomy, but are ignorant of surgery.
When it is certified to you that the tooth is painful itself, then it is necessary to sacrifice around the tooth with sponges, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is severed from all sides: then move the tooth with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first slowly, until you have crushed it
Then place the large forceps in a good place, and hold the patient's head between your knees: which you have done well, because it will not move. Then extract the tooth according to its right position, so that you do not break it
If it does not come out, then grasp some of these instruments and introduce them under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
If, however, the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary to fill the hole with cloth: and tie it with the end of a fine thread, so that it does not break in the hour of your haste with the forceps.
And it is necessary to be skilled in the art of scarification around the gums from all sides much.
Be strong, and guard your fortitude, lest you be overcome by it, and let some remain of it to return upon the infirm from that which is greater than its first pain.
Do not do that which the unskilled do, the phlebotomists of your faction, in their frenzy, and do not be overbold in its eradication, for we give you that which we have mentioned
Many indeed make them grow worse upon great men's diseases, which are more difficult to cure, and leave none of them, or take away some of them: or take away the whole with some of the teeth of the jaw. Thus have we seen many do
Then it is to be joined after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
If blood flows from any place (for many indeed flow from its place), then there is something from the limb which must be taken away with it: and if this does not suffice, burn it if it does not yield the limb.
The tweezers which you must use to grasp the tooth in the first place are long-necked and have short handles, thick, so that they do not bend when pressure is put upon them: they are like robust handles of tongs, until when they are bound with the tooth, they do not bite themselves, nor bend: short-necked, and are made of iron or hammered out of sheet iron, directed towards the extremity: and in their extremities are teeth, some of which enter into some of them, and bind the constriction loosely, moderately strong
And when the extremities become like the beak of a bird called a ciconia, and are strong constrictions.
Chapter 1.
Of the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jaw bones.
When the tooth remains after eradication, and it breaks something, then it is necessary to apply butter to the surrounding area for one or two days until it softens: then introduce the forceps into the cavity, or graspers: whose extremities absorb the hairs which are called ciconia. This sentence describes the use of forceps in dental treatment. The forceps are used to grasp and remove any remaining tooth fragments or other debris from the treated area.
The handles of the forceps are made like a file or like an awl
If, however, these do not suffice to remove the tooth, then it is necessary to cut above the root and remove the entire pulp, and introduce the small chisel, which is called a chisel, whose shape is like this
The handles of the forceps are short and thick: and they must not be wet, lest they break.
If the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to cut again with other instruments whose shape is like these
The first triangle-shaped handle has some thickness in it
The triangle-shaped handle is thin
And with other instruments and instruments which go before the teeth.
It is necessary to grasp with this instrument which absorbs a large single hair, of this shape, triangle-shaped handle twisted, which has some thickness, so that it does not break: and it must not be wet.
You know that there are many instruments for teeth: and similarly the rest of the instruments do not agree: and a prudent artisan, skilled in his art, will himself find the best instrument for each operation and for the nature of the disease.

If the tooth is dense, from which a part is broken off and affects the tongue, it is necessary to ligate it until the sharpness of that fracture is removed, and it is equalized: and it is flattened, and does not affect the tongue, nor corrupt the speech.
Chapter 33.</start_of_turn>
On the Retension of Teeth with Wire.
When it happens that the front teeth are fractured by percussion or in any other way, and the patient cannot bite without pain: it is necessary to ligate them with wire. For silver is easily tarnished, and putrefies after a few days: but gold never changes.</start_of_turn>
And let the wire be of medium thickness and of such a size as to grasp between the teeth.</start_of_turn
And the form of the ligation is that you take the wire and pass its double through between two healthy teeth: then you tie it with two extremities of the wire between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you have secured it until you reach the healthy tooth of the other side.</start_of_turn And do it again until you reach the part from which you began: and keep your hand steady with wisdom, so that it does not slip: and make your ligation as close as possible to the root of the teeth, so that it does not move.</start_of_turn
And cut off the excess of the wire with shears: and join each end together and bind them easily: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moved tooth, so that it does not affect the tongue: then release the tension as much as remains.</start_of_turn
If however it is resolved or fractured, ligate it with another wire and keep it stable in this way for a whole time.</start_of_turn
This is the shape of a tooth, and the figure of the return of two sound teeth and two moving teeth, like water.
When one tooth, or two after a fall or inflammation in their places, returns as we have said, and remains: this does not happen except by a skillful and experienced artificer
When some bone or cartilage has been adjusted: and it is made like the shape of a tooth, and is placed in its place, from which the tooth is supported and attached, as we have said: and it remains, and serves its purpose for a long time.
Chapter XXXIV.
When this ligament which happens under the tongue is cut, it is either natural, as it is born with man, or accidental, from an injury which has healed badly
And the operation in this case is to open the mouth of the patient in your hand, and lift up his tongue: then cut through that ligament of nerves across the breadth, until the tongue is freed from its retention
If there is something hard and nodular in this, and if that comes from the consolidation of an injury: then pull out that piece of bone, and find that across the breadth, until you cut through the ligament and the knot is freed
Take care that there be no perforation in the depth of the flesh, and that you do not cut an artery there, and that blood flow does not increase
Then wash the wound with rosewater, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Then put under the tongue a piece of linen cloth, which will hold the patient throughout the night: so that it does not solidify again
If blood flow increases, then put a plug over the wound. If blood flow increases, then cauterize the wound with a lancet, which is suitable for this purpose. Then care for the wound as usual until it heals.
Chapter 5.
When there occurs under the tongue a small swelling which absorbs the small ranula, hindering the natural action of the tongue: and perchance it may grow so large that it fills the mouth.
The operation for this is to open the mouth wide open: and consider the swelling.
If there is blood of a red or black colour, hard, which does not yield to the touch of the infirm: do not touch it, for it is cancer
If it inclines towards white, in which there is moisture, then throw into it a fine sponge, and press it down with the thumb, and remove it from all sides If in the hour of your operation blood flow increases, then put over it a plug of felt, until the bleeding stops: then return to your operation, until you have removed it with its complement
Then it shall be bound up with vinegar and salt: and care for it with the usual treatment which is suitable for this, until it heals
Of the treatment of the swelling of two amygdals.
Chapter 6
When there occur between the tonsils, that is, the glands which resemble almonds, which occur outside: and which we call two Amygdals: when you have cured these as we said in the previous section, and they do not heal, then consider this
If there is a hard abscess, of a dark colour, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
If it is red in colour, and its root is large: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather let it alone until it matures Then either pierce it through, or let it rupture by itself.
If it is white in colour, round, and its root is thin: then it must be cut through
And the operation in it is as follows: consider before your operation whether the abscess has become completely calm or shows any decrease: then lie the patient with his head in your lap: open the opening of the abscess with an instrument, and take out the pus with your hands, and pull down the tongue with an instrument of this shape
Do it with silver, or with air, which is subtle like a knife.
When you have finished with the tongue, and the abscess is seen, and has fallen upon your hand: then grasp the instrument, and hold it securely, and extract the pus outwards as much as you can, without pulling out anything from the tunics.
Then pierce the abscess with the instrument which has this shape Like scissors: truly their extremities are curved, so that the opening of each of them is directly opposite the other at an angle: take care that it is not from iron, or wet wool
If this instrument is not present, then pierce it with a needle, which has this shape. It is acute from one side, not from the other side.
And after you have cut one friend, cut the other according to the same kind of incision.
And the patient shall drink cold water, or vinegar and water
If blood flows, let him drink water in which are boiled almond shells: or leaves of myrtle, or things like these from styptics, until the bleeding stops: then care for him until he is healed.
And when there are produced in the gut two other swellings beside the two tonsils. Cut these also according to what I said concerning the incision of the two tonsils equally
I have also treated a woman with a swelling that was born in her gut, which drew towards the stomach, little sense, which I thought would burst her gut: and the woman breathed from her navel, and I forbade her to eat and drink anything: and she died within one or two days
The swelling only ascended as far as it emitted two branches, until it went out through the two nasal passages.
I bound these things together quickly and firmly in one of their hooks And I pulled out from it a large piece of it.
Then I cut off the root where it had come out of the nose
And I did the same for the other nostril
I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue: and afterwards I bound the hook in the swelling: then I cut off a part of it, and no blood flowed from it: the woman immediately began to drink water, and then she ate food again
The incision should not be made from that apophysis for a long time: and the apophysis follows the place which was incisioned until it is prolonged and with it.
Therefore, we must make an incision and cauterize the apophysis between the intestines.
It stood thus from the addition: then I went away from that side, and I do not know what God did with it after me
Concerning the incision of the small apophysis
Chapter 7
When the catarrh descends to the small intestine, and there is an apophysis, and it is long: then it is called a perpendicular one: and if it is in the lower part large and round, then it is called a loop
When it is cured with what we said in the explanation, and the cure does not take hold: and the apophysis is softened from it, and is thin: then it is necessary to make an incision for it
And what is aggregated round about it, and is not of its length, and is bloody, or of a yellowish color, or black, and has no sensation: then it is necessary to make an incision of it For in this there is fear of the sick person
It is necessary therefore when the blood flows according to the mode which I mentioned from the white, and its length, that you make the sick man sit facing the sun: and pull his tongue with an instrument, of which I spoke before: then fix the loop in one hand, and draw the other downwards: and make an incision with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in the incision of two friends
And it is necessary that you do not make an incision from that, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition
If you cut too deeply from this, it causes swelling and speechlessness.
And thereafter, after the incision, use what we have said concerning the two amygdales: and take care of it until it has healed.
If, however, the patient becomes feverish from the incision: then it is necessary to use your skill in cauterization without fear or hesitation
And the manner of cauterization in this is not except with acute water: and it is that you place the head of the patient in your lap. And then grasp his tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned Then take from the water which I have mentioned above and mix with it some burnt charcoal, and apply it not too thickly, neither too thinly, and press out from it the cavity of this instrument which has this shape
And the extremities of it on which the medicine is placed are like the cochlea of a radius
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the limb itself: and the patient lies upon his side, so that the saliva may run out from his mouth from the medicine itself, and not go down into his gut and harm him
And hold your hand with the medicine. And you from the first apply some quantity of an hour over the limb, until you see that it is becoming black, and stop the biting of the medicine.
And if you wish to take away the burn, and cover it over the extremity of the radius, and fill the burn with medicine, and introduce the radius with the burn into the tube, until the burn adheres to the limb itself.
Do this many times, until you achieve what you desire from the cauterization of the limb. Then discharge the dressing: for it itself will grow and fall away in three days, or four.
If you think it will be necessary to change the dressing, change it: after cauterization remove the surrounding skin with butter, and cool with water.
The outside should be dressed with stitches, and the inside with gargles, until healed.
This is a safer and more effective treatment than a deep incision and is less dangerous
And sometimes even the wound itself will heal even better with this than with cautery or incision: for it is healed with fumigation in this way. Take calamine, hyssop, origanum, rue, saffron, chamomile, and fennel, and grind them together in a pot, and pour vinegar over them: let them boil: and cover the pot with a lid: and make a hole in the middle of the pot, above which place an instrument that is concave according to this manner
Make it from silver or brass: and introduce the extremity, in which there is a pomegranate, into the bone of the patient, until the vapor reaches the wound above the canula, until the wound is much obscured
Then repeat over it many times, until it heals.
And be careful, do not make this treatment at the beginning of an abscess. For in the abscess let the heat be added: and do not do this except when the abscess has cooled down
If however this instrument is not present to you, then take a needle and make in the extremity of it bark of willow: so that the bone of the patient does not burn: for the bark of willow hinders the vapor from burning the bone: and this is from a good treatment with safety.
On the extraction of thorns and bones from the gullet.
On the extraction of thorns and bones from the gullet.
There are many bones or fish thorns that adhere to the gullet.
It is necessary therefore to extract what is visible from the gut after the tongue has been moved with an instrument at the edge of the epiglottis, and it must be declared whether there is anything remaining in the gullet
And what is not visible to the eye but is hidden in the gullet, it is necessary to make the abdomen soft before food is eaten in the stomach Perhaps the attached things will go out by themselves.
Or the patient may swallow a soft fragment of bread or a piece of cheese, or swallow saliva; or take a sponge soaked in seawater and bind it in a thread, and then swallow it. When it has reached the place where the thorns or bones are, and they are extracted, they are ejected.
If they do not come out with it as we have said: then use an instrument like this made of lead
It should be thicker than a bean and have a hook at the end which will enter the gullet easily: and it should have its head raised above the level of the gut
And take care not to touch its epiglottis, so that it does not suffer from spasm, and push with all your might so that the bone or thorn, or the thing which has been introduced, is driven out by the physician's hand
Indeed, when the patient has introduced something himself, this is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing: and he should push downwards or draw his hand upwards with the instrument, throughout all this according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it comes out
On the Extraction of the Blood-Sucking Worm.
On the Extraction of the Blood-Sucking Worm.
When the blood-sucking worm is treated with what I have mentioned in the preceding discourse concerning the care of physicians, and it does not yield, then consider in the belly of the patient the root of the worm alone, or at the root of the tongue after you have seized it with the instrument which I mentioned to you.
If, therefore, your hook slips over the blood-sucker, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps from the center
If this is not possible with these means: then take a curved needle and introduce the worm into the belly of the patient as far as the belly itself: then introduce into the curve of the needle a burning iron with fire Do this several times: and let the patient abstain from all water for the whole day.
Then give the patient a complete treatment with cold water, and open his mouth with it: and close his mouth with it, and do not swallow anything from it: and drink water an hour after each meal with your hand The blood-sucker will then depart when it feels the water falling.
If, however, it does not depart with what we have mentioned, then fumigate the patient with vinegar, or with an ass with the instrument which we mentioned in the fumigation of a wound
Do this several times, for it will depart by itself
And the manner of operation in fumigation is that you take all the jars which have dates with fire in them: and the jars are covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole: and insert in that hole the extremity of the instrument.</start_of_turn>
Then project the fumes upwards, and place the diseased limb into the extremity of the tube, and close the limb, so that the fumes do not escape, until you know that the fumes have reached the blood. For the blood vessel immediately ruptures.
If it does not rupture, repeat the fumigation many times.</start_of_turn>
And the patient can endure sitting, and eat salt, and garlic, and does not drink water.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary therefore that he depart with this regimen.</start_of_turn>
And this is the fashion of the instrument with which the blood vessel is extracted from the gut when it ruptures over the vessel itself.</start_of_turn>
It is like pincers, thus: because it has that curvature which enters the gut.</start_of_turn And its extremity is like the beak of a heron which is called ciconia, in which there is the roughness of lime: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.</start_of_turn
Of the opening of the intestines, and their section, and care in general.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XL.</start_of_turn
There are many kinds of intestines, of various modes, according as the memory of their origin comes to mind: and they are diverse in their perforation and their section into two modes.</start_of_turn
One of them is the kind of intestine which comprehends moisture.</start_of_turn
And the other kind is because of the place where it occurs in the body.</start_of_turn
Since the apostema occurs in the head, it is different from the apostema of an accidental nature in the year: and the apostema occurring in a fleshy place is different from the apostema of an accidental nature in the joints: and each one of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And from aposmata there are those which must not be pierced until after the completion of health in the body, and its complement: and there are those which must be pierced while they are raw and do not mature according to the complement.
Like the aposmata which are adjacent to the joints.
Since the apostema when it occurs close to a joint and its duration is prolonged, until it putrefies which is around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: which is the cause of the closer contraction of that limb
Or it is the apostema of a principal limb: since if you delay its perforation until it matures, the bone will bite through either the skin or the bone of that principal limb.
Or it is close to a joint, perforate it therefore while it is immature: and it must not be pierced, as regards the apostema of a raw, incomplete digestion, except when it is close to the joint, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and extends to the interior of the limb, and makes a fistula, or results in its termination which does not heal
It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of the apostema, which is matured according to the complement: and it is in the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and decrease of redness, and pulse, and the sharpness of the apostema of the head: and the rest of the signs.
It is necessary that you make the perforation in a lower place of the apostema, and of greater prominence: and let the perforation be wide in the length of the body, if the aposmata are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of laceration, and strings, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all the places equally, in which there is no reflection.
In these, however, which reflect, use with perforation according to that limb.
When indeed the swelling is in a carnous place: then it is better that you defer the perforation of it until its digestion has been confirmed, as we said according to the addition
For if you perforate it before that, you prolong the course of the infection from it, and there is much pus and discharge, and it may swell up its lips, and its depth.
And some swellings are perforated according to the width of the body for necessity: or according to that which the limb requires
It is necessary, that you administer in small swellings a small perforation, and in large swellings a wide perforation: or multiple sections according to the likeness of the size of the swelling
And there are some swellings in which it is necessary that the skin should be cauterized: and it happens when it is made like a piece of leather, and when it is made at the end, because it is dead: as it happens in many, as in a wound of the dubelet, and of the bubonis
And there are some which are cut through by a section having three angles. And there are some which are like the shape of the leaf of a myrtle tree
Like the swelling of the groin.
And there are some in which an round section and a lunar section are administered: and similar swellings to these are sectioned
That which has no head, like the superficial lenious swellings, must be perforated with a superficial perforation, or only slightly
And it is necessary, when the swelling is great, and has collected much blood, and you perforate it, that you do not remain there and extract the pus throughout that hour: but extract from it a part of it immediately Then apply the poultice until another day. Then remove some of the pus again.
Do this frequently according to the degree of the case: especially if the patient is feeble in spirit, or a woman in childbirth, or a young child, or an old man decrepitus: for the spirit of the animal is dissolved with the evacuation of the poison: and perhaps the patient will die, and you will not know it.
Therefore take heed of this chapter, for it contains great caution
And after you have pierced the abscess, which you will pierce with the poultice, you must drain the wound: and consider it If there is a small wound in the abscess, or if it is a flat section, then give an ointment of linen, or an old coat. And if there is a large abscess, and there are many holes of perforation, then you must introduce into every hole a piece of lint, until they reach the bottom
And if you have excised a part of the skin in the abscess, or if you have cauterized around it: then you must apply an old coat, or like when a bandage is taken off, or cover it with hair without moisture: and keep it tight until the third day
Then remove it, and care for it until it is healed
If however blood flows in your hour of operation, then give cold water, and vinegar, after it has been drunk in a cloth: and put it over the place where the blood is flowing liberally.
If the bleeding persists, then you must administer regimen, and care, and powders, which I have mentioned in many places of this book, and from experience
If, however, it is in the season of the snows, and the seat of the apostematis is of many nerves: then it is necessary to infuse the inflamed swellings with wine, and apply warm compresses: and place them over the seat.
If, however, it is in summer, and the seat is fleshy: then it is necessary to apply soaked sponges with water, or wine and oil, and keep it cold. Until then, as we have said, on the third day you must drain the apostema, and remove it, and administer for its care what is appropriate until it is healed
This is what is necessary to know concerning the treatment of apostemata in general
According to the principles of this classification, as I have said concerning every apostematum, how it is possible to treat it appropriately in each case.
Chapter 41.
Of the excision of apostemata that occur in the head.
Small apostemata occur in the head and are of the kind of nodules which contain veins, which are like sacks: as if they were the breasts of a hen
There are many kinds of them.
Some are fat: and some contain moisture like mud: and some contain moisture like wet earth and stones of various kinds
And in the excision of all of them, and in their extraction, there is no fear, as long as during their excision there is no injury to the arteries
The operation in the excision of these is to learn how to use the instrument which has the form which comes after these, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains
If it contains moisture, dry it out by sectioning according to the length of the superficial section: according to this form.
If there is moisture in it, dry it out by cutting from point b to point g. When the moisture has gone, remove the membrane which contains it, without leaving any residue behind
For much moisture returns if anything remains in it.
Then immerse the wound in Egyptian unguent if there is any: or in water and salt: and anoint with olive oil, and leave it until tomorrow. The wound itself consumes what remains of the membrane.
Then repeat over the wound with Egyptian unguent twice, and three times, and if you are confident that nothing remains of the membrane, then apply olive oil with unguent until it is healed
If it has a swelling node: then dry it out by cutting according to this form, sectioning which has the shape of a cross: and project the veins between the two lobes of the section, and remove it from all sides: and try your skill in extracting the membrane which contains it
If however it makes resistance, the artery is to be treated as I shall tell you afterwards.
And do the same with a stone abscess, by cutting and curing in the same way, as we said before.
And the cutting of a stone abscess is easier: because there is little blood and moisture. And sometimes there are certain abscesses in the head of some people, in which there is no moisture.
That is: because I saw over an abscess in the head of a maidservant, and I found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if it was pierced with anything else, it burst open.</start_of_turn>
In other cases, however, in head injuries, besides these, there are also those which happen in the heads of children, and near the roots of the ears, the section should be superficial.
The section should always be made from below upwards, so as to avoid injuring the course of the blood towards the lower parts
One must take care of these things which are suitable for the case.
Regarding the section of the tonsils in the throat.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 42.
Many wounds of this kind happen in the throat, under the tonsils, and in the groin: and sometimes in other parts of the body.
And over these which arise in the throat, there is one, and many: and they are caused by a blow: and every tonsil is within its own tunic, just as in the nodes and wounds of the head, as we have mentioned
There are many kinds of tonsils And from these there are fatty ones: and there are those which contain humours: and there are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment
In this way, however, as regards the evacuation of a good portion of the humours, whose mark is a colour similar to that of the skin, and which moves to every part, and is not attached to the nerves of the throat, neither to the veins, nor to the arteries, nor is it deep: it should be performed by a superficial incision from the upper part downwards of the body along a line from the b. to the g., and the skin should be stretched out with two lips, or with many threads, if necessary, as we have said in the wounds of the head, and the humours should be extracted gradually.
It is very cautious to avoid the bone or the nerve.
It is not to be rash in dealing with the incisions: so as not to cause damage to the hand with the knife, nor to alarm or grieve the patient unnecessarily.
If however you do cut the bone, or the artery, or are forbidden from the operation, then put in the wound a soaked sponge, or some powder which absorbs blood, and bind up the wound, and leave it alone until the bleeding has ceased, and the wound has been softened: or begin again and let it gangrene.
For indeed blood stops only by tension. Return therefore to your operation, until you have completed it.
Then inquire about your finger with your index finger, whether anything remains of the other small parts: so cut easily and wash away easily.
If indeed in the root of the phalanx there is a large bone: then it is necessary not to cut that phalanx from its root: but rather to bind it with a strong doubled thread, and leave it alone until it falls out by itself without any nourishment
Then apply to the wound a little of the Egyptian unguent which you have immersed. Take care of yourself.
If the whole phalanx is cut through, then it is necessary to gather together the two lips of the wound: and hold them fast, after you have washed away because otherwise there will remain excess.
If indeed there remains excess because of the size of the phalanx, then it is necessary to bring to an end the cutting of its root and to extract it: and administer the suture as we said.
And concerning the parts of the phalanx which contain moisture, pierce them with a superficial perforation: so as to make visible to you the place of maturity of that part: and put the perforation from that which follows below the body, as we said
Then manage after the perforation of the liver with unguent, and like this with other similar things, until when you see the wound has healed: then take care of the liver with the unguent of generation of flesh until it is healed.

Then the secret of the sponge is this: it signifies above the division of the canal from the phlegm which issues from it, when that which is broken is cut off, and the cutting of the piece.
Leave the wound open for a while at some other time.
When the hour has passed in which the inflammation subsides, join together the two lips of the wound with skin only, without cartilage
Then give medicines which make new flesh grow, until the wound is healed
Albucasis says. This is the end of Albucasis's explanation. The exposure is not complete until the patient has expired, because the patient is already dead as a result of the disease. The patient's breath is obstructed by the swelling of the epiglottis, which is why the patient is unable to breathe through the mouth. The patient is therefore suffocating. Therefore it is commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease has passed. And the malice of the disease is three days, and almost like that. Therefore when the malice has passed, the swelling will be gone and the wound can be closed.
And this which I have seen myself, that a handmaid took a knife and put it in her mouth, and it went down into her windpipe.
I was called to care for her, and I found her dead, like a drowned man.
I saw that there was blood flowing out of the wound of her foot I am suspicious that it did not close by itself, nor did it guide itself: and the air was coming out of the wound
Properly, therefore, and of his own will, and cared for himself, until he was well: and nothing happened to the handmaid except that she was thrown into the water. She returned after a day to her former condition.
Accordingly: there is no fear in the Epiglottis section.
Concerning the section of the hernia gutturis.
Chapter XLIV.</start_of_turn>
This hernia is called the hernia gutturis, is a great swelling, according to the colour of the body: and it is very common among women.</start_of_turn
It is of two kinds: either it is natural: or it is accidental.</start_of_turn
In the natural kind there is no cause.</start_of_turn
The accidental kind is of two kinds: one of which is like a swelling of fat nodules.</start_of_turn The other kind is like a swelling caused by the bursting of an artery.</start_of_turn And in this there is fear, and it is not permissible to assume that it is only a wound, except in the case where it is slight: and you must examine it, and investigate it with an instrument.</start_of_turn If you find it like a swelling of fat, and it is not suspected of any other disease: then dry it up like fat knots: and extract it with the thing which contains it from the bag, if it is in a bag: and if not, then explore the whole of it.</start_of_turn Then care for the place with it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Head Chapter XLV.
Concerning the section of the upper parts of the nodes.</start_of_turn
The head is of great variety; and I have already spoken of all the varieties in detail: and it is necessary to state here the difference between the Node and the Exitus, since doubt arises concerning them.
I say therefore, that when the Exitus is hot, and there is fever and pain, until the ebullition of excess is settled and putrefaction is completed: then the fever and heat will cease
But when the Node is concerned, there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains the black bile, which is the natural bag, and is according to the colour of the body: and is the commencement of their disease like barley, and causes swelling like a blister, and is greater or less.
And there are two kinds: either soft or containing moisture. And the colours of moisture are many, as I have mentioned in detail before
It is necessary therefore, when you are dealing with the Node, to examine it, and to inquire about it first with the instrument which is called the Intromissum, according to the form of the latter in the following chapter
And the way of inquiry concerning the apostemata, and all the Nodes, is that you take this instrument and introduce it into the moist place which you find in the apostemata: and you draw out your fingers gradually, until you know that the instrument has pierced the skin Then lastly put your hand according to the measure of the size of the apostematum.
Then draw out the Intromissum, and consider that which comes out in the mark of its incision
If therefore it comes out running moisture, whatever be its colour: then dry it with a superficial section, according as I have mentioned in the other apostemata
If moisture does not issue from the cavity of the Intromissi, then you know that it is fat: for it has a section above it resembling a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you. Suspend it with hooks and scour the skin from every part with ease. Keep the intestines away from it, so that you may extract them whole with the knot.
If, however, the intestine bursts during the operation and it is not possible to extract it whole, much is lost thereby. In such a case, extract it piecemeal until nothing remains of it.
For if anything remains of it, little or much, it returns to the knot according to most
If it incites you, and something remains of it: then put a sponge moistened with corrosive powders on the completion of your work. Suspend the sponge and place above it the soft tissue which rests upon the hard seat, and care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed
If there is a large knot, then split its two lips and care for it with that which adheres to it
If, however, there is a pulsating or non-pulsating swelling: then correct it, and place a compress over the wound and let it go in two or three days, until the sponge decays and the blood boils over: then return to the work which remains from the knot.
Chapter XLVII.
Of the instruments outside which are needed for cutting and perforating.
These are the forms of the Intromissi, and there are three kinds.
There are three of them: the large, the medium, and the small
Let iron nails be driven around the circumference of the square base, so that they hasten the entrance into the apostemate.
These are the forms of experience, and no, that is, perforations: and one of them is called beris, which is, perforating: and there are three kinds.
There is a great one, a medium one, and a small one.
They meet together, so that they may be investigated through the apostemata, and exits, and fistulas, and bubbles from what is between the bones.
And others are round, third, flat, like a large needle which travels under its burr, from citrine, or from air, or iron, or silver
And the best of them are those which are made from citrine.
And there are also experiences made of black lead, which meet together so that they may investigate fistulas, the cavities of which are reflections, as they reflect with their smoothness with those reflections
And there are three kinds of them again For since they are made from iron, they are long, medium, and short, according to the quantity of the diameter of the fistula and the tightness of its structure
The shape of needles, and there are many kinds of them.
For since they are made from iron, they are simple, that is, those which have only one curve: and there are three kinds like liquids, large, medium, and small
And from iron nails are blind: and there are three kinds of them
And from iron nails are those which have two curves, and there are three kinds of them: and from iron nails are those which have three curves, and there are three kinds of them: and all of these are necessary in their place
These are the forms of scalpels which cut and scrape nodes, and their bases. There are three kinds: because they are from large, medium, and small.
Their extremities which make the cut are acute, the other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed like this except when there is an intent to make an incision in the excision of nodes near the fear of the vein, or nerve: and in order that the patient may recover more quickly from the operation than from the excision of the base.
They are made of air, and are like a rod with which alcohol is made: and at the wide end is a hidden Spatumili point: and in this runs inwards and outwards as desired, like liquid
The form of the Spatumili which are conducted between the fingers at the perforation of the base: and the patient does not perceive them: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The air bubbles which are broken when the flow of blood is cut: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
They are made of air, or lemon-yellow, round, of about the length of a liquid: and are transparent.
And it is necessary that these kinds of air bubbles should be large and small with you: in order to cut through blood quickly when necessary, and then when it is not necessary there should be no doctor present.
But do not use these instruments to cut blood in any place of the body, and do not use them except in places of carnation: such as wounds of the leg, and hip, and wounds of the arm, and breast, and belly, and groin, and similar wounds to these, from wounds of carnation, humidis.
And when small instruments like nails are sometimes found alongside the fists of the surgeons, according to their form: from which blood is separated when it flows from the site of the phlebotomy, or at the incision of the nail, or of an artery; and when they are sometimes found alongside the rounded instruments of this kind.
Chapter XLVII.
And when sometimes small instruments like nails are found alongside the fists of the surgeons, according to their shape: from which blood is separated when it flows from the site of the phlebotomy, or at the incision of the nail, or of an artery; and when sometimes found alongside the rounded instruments of this kind.
When the breasts of some men swell during sleep (that is, when they start to become soiled in sleep), until they resemble the breasts of women: and remain after the feeding has ceased.
Whoever dislikes this thing, it is necessary to cut across the breasts with a lunar section, according to this shape from the ridge, to the line, to the edge. Then scrape away all the fat Then apply a bandage of medicinal ointment Then join together the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for it, until it heals
If, however, the breast leans downwards and becomes softened because of its size, like women: then it is necessary to make two similar lunar incisions on the two upper sides, each containing the other at their ends, until one line is greater than the other, according to this shape from the ridge to the line, to the edge. Then scrape away the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and perform what has been said concerning the sutures and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it heals
If, however, you do not wish to perform the incision which is necessary, because of the anxiety of the patient, or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary to apply a soaked bandage under the nail and send it away, until that which remains of the fat has rotted away Then care for yourself until you are healed.
After perforation of the apostematus, which happened under the heel.
Chapter XLVIII.</start_of_turn>
These apostemata which happen under the heel are of the kind of hard stromelas which contain vesicles, and from these are those which contain humors.</start_of_turn
Which are from those which contain humors, must be sectioned with a lunar blade, in this form, from line b to line g, as when it is evacuated from the whole of that which is in the apostematus from the sound, then fill up the wound with wool and let it go until the next day.</start_of_turn
Then care for yourself until you are healed.</start_of_turn
If the apostematus were of the kind of knots of stromelas, then split over it, as we said concerning the stromelas which are equal.</start_of_turn
If, however, pus comes out through this, then administer cautery in it, as we said before.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XLIX.</start_of_turn
Of the perforation of the apostematus which happens through the artery and the vein.</start_of_turn
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin above the wound is consolidated, then much blood comes out from the apostematus: and in the same way blood comes out of the vein also, as it happens in this apostematus and swelling.</start_of_turn
And the signs by which it is recognized that the apostematus and swelling are from the artery and the vein, are: because when the apostematus is from the artery, it is long and aggregated in the depth of the body: and when the inflamed apostematus touches your fingers, you feel as though there is a constriction.</start_of_turn
And that which is from the vein is round in the manifest body.
And the section above this [apophysis] is an error, and especially that which is under the testicles, and the groin, and the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is great danger. It is necessary therefore that its care be taken with iron, and that from the veins also it is in the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary that its care be taken.
And that which is from the veins is from the dilation of the orifice of the artery, is found in the cut section in length Then open the section with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free the vein from the tunics, until it is severed
Then introduce under these [acumen] the needle, and make the vein penetrate until it reaches the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according as you were taught in the extraction of two veins which are in the times
Then pierce the place which is between two ligaments with sponge, until the blood which is in it all comes out, and dissolve the swelling.
Then administer the cure which generates pus, until the ligaments fall away: afterwards care for this with appropriate bandages until it is healed
And if there should be a swelling from the section of the Vein, then it is necessary that you keep your hand steady which is possible from the swelling with the cut Then introduce the needle under the place where you kept your hand steady, and make the vein penetrate: and be in it a double thread, until you extract it from the other side. Then tighten with this the swelling the ligament with good thread: according as I have said to you concerning the ligation of the veins, from two parts with two extremities of thread.
If, however, the thread has been drawn out, then insert an awl with another thread under the whole of the incision: before doing so, tighten your thread in four places.
Then dry the wound in the middle of its course, until it has healed: then cut through the excess of the skin, and let go of what is bound from it
Then place upon it the wool which you submerged in wine, and oil. Then administer care, which is done with compresses and unguents, until it is healed.
Chapter L.</start_of_turn>
As for the swelling which arises from the twisting of nerves.
Thus swelling occurs in the artery and the vein, in the same way it occurs in nerves: that which occurs in percussion, or which arises from excessive work, and in like manner: and it is for this reason that it is most frequent in the armpits, or the calves, and in every place where there is movement of the sutures: and it is a serious swelling.</start_of_turn>
Its colour is similar to that of the rest of the body, and is in various positions without pain: and when it is tightened with tension, it feels in it a feeble tremor similar to sleeplessness.</start_of_turn
It is not a swelling which is collected in the depths of the body, but is under the skin, and it moves to all parts, and does not go forward, nor backward, nor to the front, nor to the back.</start_of_turn
Because it arises from the tissues in the sutures, it is not necessary to suture it with iron.</start_of_turn Perhaps therefore contraction will occur.</start_of_turn
In that case, in the head or in the face, find the skin with the nail.</start_of_turn If there is a small fistula, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from its root.
If it is large, then suspend it with one hand and excise it: then remove it and unite it with a suture: and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Chapter LI.</start_of_turn>
As for the section of an fistula, which happens in the belly.</start_of_turn
Some people suffer from numerous fistulas in various parts of their bodies, such as the thighs, which are called Fungalia because of their resemblance to fungi.</start_of_turn
Their root is fine and their head is large, and their lips are closed.</start_of_turn They arise from a small opening and become large gradually.</start_of_turn
And indeed I saw a man who had two of these fistulas in his belly, which were larger than any others. There was no difference between them, white or black, except for the fineness of the root. They protruded outwards and moisture always ran from them.</start_of_turn
I cut them out and found in one about X and VIII ounces and in the other about six ounces. As for the operation of their incision, consider that if the patient is moist and the color of the fistula is white, moist and the root is fine, then cut it out with a broad spatula and keep your hands away from the fire.</start_of_turn
A great deal of blood is ejected at the incision. Be careful if you are stained with blood, then cauterize it.</start_of_turn
If you see a faint and timid patient at the incision with a knife, then take a lead pencil made of lead and suspend it with the thread athelul: whose method is as we have said, and discharge it in two days.</start_of_turn
Then add in stricture of lead. Then add in stricture of lead. Do not cease to tighten the lead until it breaks by itself without toil.
If the great vessel is of the root, then in its incision there is something of fear and weakness: especially that which is in the belly.
It is true that it is possible to cut through the middle of it. Then cauterize it, so that it does not return
Then care for it until the wound is healed.
And take heed lest you presume to cut through the vessel which is of the color of saffron, little sense, foul aspect: for it is the remnant of cancer: and I shall remind you of cancer afterwards
Chapter 52.
Of the care of the great vessel.
The great vessel arises from multiple ulcers. It proceeds either from rents of the liver which are above the belly: or it proceeds from the intestines, according as happens in other ruptures Or from the blood which flows from the vein, or from the artery, according as is prescribed Or from the swelling which is contracted in it
If it is because of a rent of the liver, and the outlet of the bile: then its color is similar to that of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and appears in various places If it is because of the bursting of the intestines, then its site is as we have narrated, with great variety When you thrust your finger into the wound, it is hidden; then it returns, and often makes a sound. And it swells greatly at the entrance of the bath, and causes great suffering.
If however it is because of moisture, it is soft, then it does not hide when you thrust your hand in, neither is it constricted, neither does it swell.
If it is because of blood, then with these signs the clot appears black at the edge of the nail
If however it is because of dead flesh: then it is a large, thick, hard clot, and it forms according to the quantity of one
If however it is because of wind, then its touch is soft.
And the operation in this is as you consider, if the prominence of the navel is because of blood of an artery or vein, or wind: then you must abstain from its care. For in this is fear and danger, as I told you in the chapter where I said that clots because of an artery or vein are dangerous.
If however the prominence of the navel is because of an intestine or a tumour: then you must extract the sick part, as long as it retains its natural tension, and remain extended Then the signs with the cautery around the whole circumference of the navel. Then order him to lie between your hands over his back Then go round with a sponge swab wide in the circumference of the navel over the place which you marked with the cautery. Then draw out the middle of the clot towards the upper part, with a large hook. Then bind him around firmly with thread, or with a strong silk cord: and let the knot of the ligature be at the apex.
Then open the middle of the extended bone above the ligament. If therefore you see that it has grasped itself by the ligament: then extract the apex, and introduce it into the finger index, and push the intestine into the belly: and if you see a bone, then grasp it with a hook, and cut off its surplus
But if the bone is an artery or a vein: then surround it much. Then return to your operation. And take two needles, and introduce them into the two strong threads: and introduce two needles around the circumference which you made around the bone like a cross, which you make penetrate
Then bind the bone in four places above the needles: and if you will, take out the needles, and loosen the place, until the extended flesh putrefies: and it will fall away by itself: or cut it off when it subsides and putrefies
Then care for it with what is necessary from the unguents, until it is healed
Which if the navel-cord is emitted from the flesh near the bone, or from the humidity: then it is necessary to concave the bone as we have said. And extract the blood, or the humidity, which you find in it.
Then care for it with what is necessary to solidify the place.

As we have said in the explanation of the species of Cancer, and how it is to be treated by physicians: and caution must be taken with it in the treatment with iron, so that it does not ulcerate: and we have said that Cancer is generated in the matrix, and caution must be taken in its treatment.
And they [the ancients] said, when Cancer is in a place where it can be extirpated, as for instance when it is in the breast or the thigh, or in like cases, throughout the limb from the root to the tip: especially when it is in its early stages.
When it is great and advanced, it is not right to approach it closely
I am unable to cure anyone from such a thing: neither can any other go before me who would attempt to do so
And the operation in such a case, when it is in the place mentioned above, is to precede [meaning to make an incision] and to evacuate the tumour by means of black bile several times over Then a phlebotomy must be performed if the swelling persists.
Then prepare the patient for the operation, in which he is placed alongside the operation itself.
Then cover the Cancer with hooks which agree with it Then bandage it from all sides with skin, according to the rule, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not bind it too tightly, but rather express the place, and evacuate the thick blood from your hands, or as much as is possible from the instruments.
If, however, there is a great flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or a vein: then cauterize the vein, until the bleeding stops Then care for the patient with the rest of the treatment, until he is healed
Note: The provided text does not include any information regarding the care of hydrosis, so I am unable to translate that portion of the sentence.
End of Book XIV We have narrated in detail the species of hydrosis, and how water is aggregated: and the signs of every kind, and the treatment with physicians.

If, however, the generation of Hydropisis arises from the affection of the liver: then let your left incision be from the navel for three digits.
If, however, the generation of this arises from the spleen: then let the incision be on the right side: and it is not necessary that the incision should be above that which you wish to place the diseased part, lest there should be excessive bleeding to the place of weakness.
Then perforate with the instrument the whole skin. Then introduce your hand into the incision, and grasp the liver with the Palmili between the skin, and scrape, as though you are scraping yourself: and let the amount which you scrape be as much as an amount of nails, or about this much.
Then scrape until the Palmili reaches the empty place: and that is the place of water. Then extract it, and introduce the instrument into the wound, which has this shape. It is like a tube: it is made of silver, or gold, or gold-leaf, soft, thin: in its lower part is a small hole, and in its sides are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its extremity is cut off, in the manner of a knife, like water: at its upper extremity is a cuff.</start_of_turn>
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends above the instrument, so that the water is evacuated from the water in the middle quantity.</start_of_turn
For if you evacuate more from this than is necessary, in an hour the patient may perhaps die from the resolution of the spirit of his animal: or there may happen to him a fainting which approaches death.</start_of_turn>
But evacuate from this according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what signifies to you the dispositions of the patient from the virtue of his pulse, and from his constitution.</start_of_turn
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water immediately due to the skin which retains the opening above the sac: as I have mentioned before, so that you may perforate it in the manner described.</start_of_turn>
Then repeat the instrument on the other side, if you find the patient tolerates it: and extract also from the water the quantity that remains.</start_of_turn>
Do this for a few days without fear, and take care from error: until there remains from the water little.</start_of_turn
If however you are afraid of the patient, and you discharge from the water a great deal: then take care of him with burying in warm sand, and profuse sweating in a bath and sun, and expect above the seat: and take care of him with physicians of experience, until he is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, and spleen, and liver, after the water has been extracted, according to what I mentioned before.</start_of_turn>
As for the care of children who are born in places where the bladder is not pierced.

If, however, the bladder is in the capture of a captive (obstructed), not cut round, and a part of the bladder is between the capture and the part outside: then it is necessary to stimulate the bladder which is within first, until it is consolidated, and then care for the exterior. For when you care for both simultaneously, the capture is not secured that the bladder may not burst.
And thus also in testicles, black and corrupt swelling. It is necessary therefore that you should evacuate the whole which is darkened and which wants to corrupt, or which is already corrupt
Then apply above all with honey that which is softened with fine meal of barley and powdered herbs
Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
If, however, blood-flow occurs, then administer cautery with lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cautery is therefore useful in two positions simultaneously, that is, for the flow of blood and for a wound when it is corrupted
If the head of a hair is corroded and the whole is destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary to introduce lead into the meat of the penis, so that it may mix with the infirmity above it
With regard to the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of hair, and this adhesion does not happen except in the case when the prepuce is healthy and not in need of circumcision: for when it does happen in connection with a wound or swelling, it is necessary to scrape the area with blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of hair is freed from all sides
If it is difficult to discern these things precisely, then it is necessary to scrape something from the head of hair and from the prepuce When the foreskin is slight, it may be pierced by its own thinness or quickly.
Then separate the foreskin from the head of the glans with a piece of linen cloth slightly dampened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then care for it with a sticky wine, until it is healed

Concerning the care of infants, and the treatment of an error from an accident
Circumcision is not a complete solution for continence, like other wounds: indeed, when it is done by our operation, by our will, and when its use is in young children, it is necessary that we sign in this operation for a better result, and to prevent excessive loss of semen leading to impotence.
I say, that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: because they did not make use of it in their laws, and it is not except that we have learned it through experience
For I have found in my experience a greater part of the artifices, and phlebotomists, who circumcise with a needle, and with scissors: and they use sponges, and bind with thread, and incision with a nail.
I have also tried all these methods, and I have not found a better way of circumcision than with scissors, and with the ligation with thread.
For in circumcision with a needle, much skin escapes. For the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore sometimes the upper skin escapes, and threatens the lower layer: it is thought therefore that it is necessary to make an incision to penetrate the other, and to avoid pain in the future And when the change is made by the affected part, that is, the digits, as the surgeons use them, it is not safe to make an incision at the extremity of the limb; for perhaps it will enter the hole of it.
When the nail has undergone change, perhaps iron has entered, and it corrupts your operation; for the skin of a child is short in nature, and many are born thus, which does not admit of change: and I say that of it
When the nail has undergone change, perhaps iron has entered, and it corrupts your operation; for the skin of a child is short in nature, and many are born thus, which does not admit of change: and I say that of it. When the nail has undergone change, perhaps iron has entered, and it corrupts your operation; for the skin of a child is short in nature, and many are born thus, which does not admit of change: and I say that of it.

Then bind the marked place with a doubled thread. Then bind the lower part with a piece of ligament equal to the upper ligament Then take hold with your index finger and thumb, and keep the lower ligament in place, and interlace between the two ligaments Then lift the skin upwards quickly, and extract the head of the worm. Then let the blood run out slowly (for that is better) and put down powder: and over the powder put a bandage in which the swollen part has been immersed in hot water, pounded with recent honey: and leave it on until the next day: and take care of the rest of the treatment until it is healed
But as for the form of the forceps for the loosening of these things, it is like this
There are two handles and two arms, and do not let the handle slip into the cleft of the claw: and let the length of the two be equal, as is the length of two thumbs of equal size
Indeed the error in loosening is that perhaps the whole intrinsic skin has escaped or a part of it at the incision
Therefore you must extend your hand from your hour with your finger before the excision of the place: and make the incision according to the evenness.
If you are unable to hold the hand with your finger, then extract the hand with the nail and make the incision
If, however, more than three days have passed and the swelling under the worm remains, remove the worm: then leave the wound open until the swelling subsides, and then remove the wound with ease, and make the incision according to what has been prepared: and be careful to take hold from the head of the worm It does not harm him.
It does not harm him. For if it should happen that it comes out from above the measure and reaches the upper parts, it does him no harm.
It does not harm him. For as we have said before, we must wait until he is healed
Chapter LVIII.</start_of_turn>
It does not harm him. For just as we have said before, we must wait until he is healed.
The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by the formation of a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or meat, or similar substances which we have mentioned in the preceding discourse concerning treatment.
And if the stone is not dissolved, and the retention of urine is caused by the stone which is in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary to support the knee over the knee Then they are to be placed upon his back, and the abdomen is to be pulled out from the upper part of the back, and the limb is to be bound tightly as much as possible It is necessary to think that the stone will be expelled from the neck of the bladder to the back: whereupon the urine is absolutely cured
If it does not dissolve as we have said before, and if something remains above the infirmity: then it is necessary to perform the extraction with an instrument which is called a siringa, which is formed of silver, is subtle, flexible, and curved like the quill of a bird in the smoothness of a twig, long in the fashion of a palm of one's hand and a half: to which is joined a fine needle at the head of it.</start_of_turn>
And the method of extracting the urine is as follows: take a doubled thread and bind in its extremity lanum or cotton, a good ligation: and insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the siringa: and pierce with shears if there is anything remaining of the lanum. True, insert into the needle with caution as much as possible.</start_of_turn
Then apply the sponge with oil, or butter, or alum, and make the sick man sit on a seat, and embroke the wound, and pour oil on the wound with warm oil and water.
Then introduce the sponge into the wound until it reaches the root of the wound
Then double the upper part from the navel
Then push the sponge inside the wound until it reaches the belly, and let the sick man feel that the wound has gone deep enough: do not do this according to this order except in the case where the wound is twisted
Then draw out the thread with the wool gradually. The thread follows the wool.
Then draw out the wound, and make the urine run through the opening: and repeat the sponge, and do not stop doing this until the wound is evacuated and the sick man feels relief.
As for the quality of the dressing of the wound with Clepshydra.
Chapter 59.</start_of_turn>
When it happens that there is a wound in the wound, or the blood is frozen in it, or is clotted in it with pus, and the discharge is distilled into the water and medicines: then make use of an instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its form
It is deaf, that is, closed And in it are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side, like urine
And the part which drives it, where that which is driving is located, should be according to the quantity that it desires without addition, until when it is pulled with it something is drawn along with it: and when it is driven out, when it is driven out far off: according to what the Clepshydra does which ejects naphtha, that is, Greek fire in the battles of Mars.
When the humidity is to be projected downwards into the cavity, introduce the extremity of the sponge into the humidity, and draw it out with what drives it upwards, for the humidity is thus drawn into the concavity of the sponge.
Then introduce its extremity into the cavity, as we mentioned in the syringe. Then drive the humidity with what drives it, and immediately the humidity will reach the cavity, as the patient feels it
Form a soft blister in which the cavity is closed.</start_of_turn>
Make it of silver or gold: whose head is like a small dish, and under it the sinus where the ligament is located.</start_of_turn>
Then take hold of the bladder with air, and put in it the humidity which will cause the bladder to swell.</start_of_turn Then bind the two sinuses together with strong thread with a double knot: and warm up the humidity slightly over the fire.</start_of_turn
Then introduce the extremity of the blister into the cavity, then close the hand over the bladder with the humidity until the patient feels that the humidity has reached the bladder.</start_of_turn
If however the patient does not have a bladder, then take a piece of gut and make a circle from it, and pierce it through from all its roundness.</start_of_turn Then introduce strong thread firmly through these holes, as they are being rotated.</start_of_turn Then gather the circle, as they gather alum, and when you have placed in it what you wish of humdities, and oils, and waters.</start_of_turn
Then bind the tissue firmly to the instrument: and do as you would do with a bladder when expressing it with your hand, until moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60
Regarding the extraction of a stone.
We have already spoken concerning the types of stones and their treatment with doctors: and we have spoken of the difference between a stone generated in the intestines and a bladder stone, and the signs of the former: and we have spoken of the method in which the operation is performed with the hand and section: and this is the stone that is generated in the bladder itself: and that which appears in the urine. And I will speak of this with a clear explanation and brevity.
I say therefore, that the stone that is generated in the bladder mostly happens to children.
And from the signs of it, it is known that the urine comes out of the bladder like water in its fluidity: and there appears in it white sand, and it irritates the painful area of the urine, and it works with it, and it hangs over much. Then it is erected, and comes out with the anus in many people.
And it is easy to heal the children of this, until they reach the age of fourteen And it is difficult in old age In young people, however, it is middle-aged, in which there is between these two: and the larger the stone, the easier the cure: and if it is small, the cure is more sparing
When we come to the treatment, it is necessary in the first place to empty the patient with a catharsis, which extracts all the stool that is in his intestines: for it often hinders the discovery of the stone during the examination
Then he shall take the patient with his feet and thrust him forward, and move him downwards: that the stone may descend into the depth of the bladder, or that it may leap from a high place.
Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands rest under his buttocks, so that the bladder may be completely tilted downwards
Then ask him and touch him externally.
If you feel the stone in the space, then immediately seize it with a section above it
If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must pull out the index finger of your left hand if the patient is young: or the middle finger if he is complete; and insert it into his rectum, and ask about the stone, until it is under your finger: and bring it slowly up to the neck of the bladder
Then press above it with your finger, and push it outwards against the place where the section is: and command the minister to grasp the bladder with his hand, and command another minister to extend the testicles of his right hand upwards: and another hand to move the skin which is under the testicles on the part where the section is
Then insert Sponge of the kind that has this shape And find it between the rectum and the testicles, and not in the middle, at the side of the left hip: and let the section be above the stone, and your finger be in the rectum: and make a transverse incision, so that the external incision is wide and the internal one is narrow, according to the quantity that is possible for the stone to pass out of it.
Perhaps the finger which is in the rectum will grasp the stone at the section, and will come out without difficulty
And know that from the Stone [bone] there is that which has angles and margins, whereby its exit becomes difficult on account of these things.
And from this [substance] it is soft, like a gland, and round: and makes its egressus easy.
Therefore, in the fissure [of the bone] where there are angles and margins, add [something] to make the passage easier.
If it does not come out thus, then it is necessary that you bring about an incision above it: or that you bind above it with a bandage whose extremity is like the Moon, which binds upon the Stone, and does not slip from it: or that you introduce beneath it a subtle instrument, with curved extremities
Or if these things do not suffice, then enlarge the opening nearby. If anything from the blood incites you, cut it off with a saw
If there is more than one bone, then impale the large one first to the bone of the buttocks. Then make an incision above it. Then impale the small one afterwards: and do the same if there are more than two
If the great one is hollow, then ignorance is not to cut above it with a great section For it happens to a sick person one of two things, either that he dies, or that his urine becomes excessively concentrated: because the place is not consolidated in any way.
Truly manage its expulsion until it comes out: or bring about a fracture of its fracture with forceps until you have removed it broken
When you have completed your operation, then apply a cloth of wool, aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and place upon it a soaked bandage of oil and wine, or of rose oil and cold water: so that the swelling will subside
Then rest the patient supine above his shoulder, and do not loosen the ligaments, until the third day. When you have finished loosening it, embroider the place with water, and pour much of it in
Then care for it with fine unguents, and with aloe, until it is healed
If, however, in the wound a hard swelling is added, and pus, and similar things: thus also if blood is congealed in the bladder, and is withheld from it by urine: this is known from the discharge of blood with urine. Introduce your finger into the wound, and extract the clot of blood. For if it remains, it causes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and oppose all things which are harmful with what is useful for the cure, until it is healed
And take care in the hours of the cure of the whole thing, as to bind up two thighs, and to apply pressure, which are the causes of the medicines which are placed upon the place
Which if the stone is small, and lies in the meat of the bladder, and appears in it, and hinders the discharge of urine: then care for it with that which I have mentioned before until you reach the section Many times indeed is one excused from section by this cure, for I prove this to you.
And it is that you take a perforator of iron, which has this form, triangular extremities, acute, fixed in wood
Then take thread, and bind with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder
Then insert the perforating iron into the abscess with ease, until it reaches the Perforatorium itself: and withdraw the Perforatorium gradually from the same stone: and make the perforation, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
The urine is indeed immediately expelled.
Then place your hand over that which remains of the stone from the outside of the abscess It itself will break, and goes out with the urine, and the patient is healed
But if these things are not prepared for him, because of something that hinders it: then bind a thread under the stone, and a thread above the stone. Then dry upon the stone within the abscess between two ligatures. Then extract it. Then loosen the ligature, and bind the frozen blood, which forms in the wound.
And it is not necessary to bind a thread under the stone, except when it does not withdraw from the cavity: and bind the other thread above, except when you loosen the thread after the withdrawal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and closes the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to bind the upper thread when you elevate the skin to its proper position, so that the skin returns to its original place, and closes the wound, as we have said
Chapter 61.</start_of_turn>
Of the extraction of stones from women.
Stones are not often formed in women
If, however, it happens to any of them that a stone should form, then its cure is difficult, and is prohibited on account of many things
One of them is: perhaps a woman is a madman.
Secondly, you will not find a woman who will confess to being a doctor when she is chaste or married to men.
The third is that you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially performing operations with her hand.
Moreover, the distance from the stone place [an anatomical landmark] is great: where a deep incision is needed, and there is fear.
If need compels you to reach that point, then you must take a female doctor who knows well how to do so: and few are found
If you desire these things beforehand, then seek a chaste and prudent doctor, and present a skilled female midwife or a woman who has learned a part of this art: make her do everything that is required of her from the inquiry concerning the stone
Firstly, that she is perhaps a madman: then you must insert your finger into her belly and search for the stone.</start_of_turn>
If you find it, grasp it under your finger and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the lower belly of the patient and inquire about the stone after placing your left hand on the vulva and compressing it gently.</start_of_turn>
If you find the stone, then you must gradually move it from the opening of the vulva downwards with all your skill until you have brought it down to the root of the coccyx.</start_of_turn>
Then cut above it at the middle of the vagina at the root of the coccyx from whichever side is most convenient for you, and feel the stone in that place: and do not move your finger from the stone, holding it under it: and make a small incision at first.</start_of_turn Then he introduces radium through the opening.
Then he introduces radium through the opening. If he feels a stone, then he adds to the section a quantity proportionate to the amount of stone which projects from it
And know that there are many kinds of stones Of these there are small and large, soft and hard, long and round having a branch.
You know therefore the kind of these things, as it is signified by this over that which you wish to apply it
If blood flows, then add on the edge a little burnt earth, and keep it for one hour, until the blood is clotted.
Then return to your operation, until the stone comes out: and make ready with me the instruments which I mentioned in the extraction of the stone from the bladder, so that you may aid me in this operation
If blood flows, and you know that the evacuation of blood is from the artery which has been cut: then put powder on the place and bind it with threads: and do not move it: and let go of the stone, and do not extract it Perhaps the woman is too weak. Then care for the patient.
When the acute pain of the blood has ceased after a few days, and the place has become putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone comes out
Chapter 122
Of the incision of the super Herniam aquosam
The swelling is not of the aquosa radix, except for the collection of moisture in the white membrane which is under the testicles containing urine: and it is called a hernia.
And when it is within the proper cavity itself, which the nature has prepared for it in part or otherwise, until it is required: that is, another thing, and is the skin of the testicles between the white fat, which we have mentioned: it does not happen except rarely.
And the generation of these seeds is from the weakness that happens to the testicles: whereupon it flows out to them. And when it happens from a blow upon the testicles
And this moisture has many colors. Or its color is like the slopes of citrons, or it is reddish-bloody, or greenish-yellow, or black like dung, or white like water, and this is better
And the signs by which you know where the accumulation of water is, are these For if it is in the white fat which we have mentioned, then the swelling is round to the length like the figure of an olive: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper cavity itself, then the swelling is round with a part like an olive, and for this reason the man knows that it is another thing.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white fat, then it lies under the skin.
When therefore one understands the color of the moisture, then to experience the color of the moisture in the swelling with the introduction of a square, whose form preceded it According to that therefore as it comes out in the trace of the introduction, judge about that which is between it
When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary to remove the patient, to perform phlebotomy if possible, and to fill the body with liquids.
Then the thing rests upon its back upon a high thing nearby, and put under it many cushions.
Then sit thou on its left side, and command the minister, that he sit on its right side, who shall extend his arm to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part near the navel.
Then take a broad sponge, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along their length, until near the navel: and make a cut according to the equality of a straight line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white membrane which includes the testicles: and scrape it away, or cut it out directly, as thou wilt: and let thy scraping be from that side which hangs down with the greater part. And scrape gently according to the quantity that thou canst manage.
Then pierce the full bladder with a wide perforation, and drain out all the water.
Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the bladder upwards, and do not touch the testicles included: and cut the bladder as thou wilt, either completely or in fragments, especially its broad side slightly For if thou dost not carefully scrutinize it, in its incision there will be no security, that the water will not return
But if anything exterior to the skin comes out in the hour of thy operation: then when thou hast completed the cutting of the bladder, reduce it. Then join together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Then care for it like the rest of the wound, until it is healed
And if thou find anything corrupted from blackness else, then it is necessary that thou bind up the parts which are the support, fearing the flow of blood.
Then remove the testicle with the holder, and extract the seed: afterwards care for it as we have said.
If indeed water is gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two roots: dry therefore the other part equally as you did in the other
And if it is made equal, so that the operation be one, then do so: then draw off the blood. And introduce into the incisions the lancet submerged in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside the lancet another lancet than you submerged in wine and oil, and expand between two testicles, and look inside: and place over them two layers of cloths, and there are sponges: and ligate above with a ligament which is having six like this shape.
Then soak up two cloths, and wash, and apply the carmine ointment, according to this likeness: and let the extremities which are sent forth from the flank, or wet lancet: and gather with the tightening in the lumbar region of the flanks: and one extremity will take over the top of one until the shoulder, and the second will take over at the part of the loin: and two extremities on two thighs below, and two extremities on two groins, and gather the whole tightening in the lumbar region of the flanks.
And when it is medically necessary to sew up this wound with cautery in the place of the incision with a knife: and it is that you take the cautery with a fine knife, and cut with it the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according as we have said: until it is recognized that there is a white sponge containing water: then take the cautery, according to this shape
Like the Greek letters.
Then pierce with it that sponge, and it is ignited, until the total humidity comes out
Then extend the sponge with hooks, and burn away the boils with a gentle flame, and cut through it as much as you can, until you have excised all of it.
And burn from outside, so that the flame does not touch it.
You know that this operation is safer and more lasting than one with excision
If indeed in the hour of excision or in the hour of cauterization there is a swelling, or a blood flow, or something else: then it is necessary to treat that which makes the adversity to you in that matter with the treatment that is suitable for it, as has been said before.
But if the patient is timid and does not expect such an operation because of its horror: then I give perforation as I have said before: and it is that.
When it is certified to you by me that the liquid has ceased: then you must make the patient sit on a raised seat
Then pierce the boil in its lower part with a wide spatula: and make the incision according to the length of the body, and keep the opening wide open until the water has drained out entirely.
Then place on the place of the foot, and ligate it, and let it drain out the remaining water: then care for it until the wound is healed
If however there is resistance to the discharge of the water in the hour when you pierce it: and this is not except for the white pus which makes adversity in the opening of the wound, and hinders the discharge of the water: then it is necessary to introduce a needle into the wound, or an instrument with which the watery humors are extracted, whose form has been described: or to add in the operation of the wound a little of that which has been mentioned.
And know that water returns [to its source] and is aggregated after six months, or thereabouts. When it is aggregated again, it returns in the same way and passes over the sick days of their life.

And perhaps it is a stone swelling, whose colour is dark, and there is no sense in it.</start_of_turn
And sometimes it is from the swelling of the arteries, and the inflation of these: as I have mentioned above concerning its reminder: or from the swelling of the veins.</start_of_turn
That is from the swelling of the arteries, it is known by the arrangement of the swelling, when you press it with your finger.</start_of_turn And it is not proper that thou touchest it with thine hand.
For it is because of the swelling that it is done, it does not vanish by the pressure of the fingers.
It is also possible that over this kind of swelling there may be a cutting, and over the rest of the body: and that is that one should cut through the skin of the testicles. Then stretch out the limb upwards, and draw it out with a white cloth: and cut through the swelling from the belly, and bind the belly: and cut through the swelling when you have freed it from all sides of the limb.
If any limb is consolidated with those native bones, then it is necessary that thou draw out the limb, and cut through it
And if there is an adhesion between something of the bones or in that which is between the bones: then it is necessary that thou free the whole adhesion, and cut through it with a round incision
But if there is a natural bone in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that thou cut through all of that, and draw out the limb, as we have said
When thou hast finished the work, then put in a bandage of wool in the wound which is bound up with silk, and wine: and take care of it with the rest of the treatment, until it be healed.
Chapter 122.
Concerning the care of limbs, which are with Vite.
A swelling is a swollen tumor which fills the limb like a bag, similar to a bladder, with the softening of the testicles: and it makes difficult for the infirm to move and exercise, and to walk.
And in the treatment of this ailment is from fear, because of the thing which precedes it is remembered.
Truly, it is necessary to say that the operation should be performed as they have done previously.

Why do the intestines descend from the rupture to one testicle? The rupture is either from a fistula or an extension of it.
These two species of rupture occur from many causes: from a blow, from a jump, from a sneeze, from elevation of a heavy object, and similar things.
The sign is when it is from an extension of the fistula It happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen immediately: and is equal to the depth of the wound: because the fistula compresses the intestine.
The sign of it is when it is from a section of the fistula, because it makes the pain increase immediately: and the wound is diverse, appearing under the skin close at hand: and this is because the intestine comes out through the fistula, and its course is to the exterior of the fistula
And when it comes out with the intestine, it is called a intestinal hernia, and a bursting: and when it is with swelling.
And when it runs into the intestine and holds it there: and this is with great pain: because it makes the pain worse, and especially when it is pushed out.
And in the treatment of these diseases of the fistula with iron there is fear: because it is necessary to avoid the cause of it.
The mode of operation is to take hold of the main pain of the patient, in order to reduce the intestine back into its own cavity, if it obeys the return of the fistula Then it is laid back over its collar between your hands: and elevate the edges of it
Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the upper part, and dry the entire testicle skin along its length Then fix in two incisions the section of the gut, according to what is necessary to open the section with ease: and the section be according to quantity, as much as is possible, that it may depart from it all the excrement.
Then strip off the faeces, and all that is under the skin of the testicles, until the white belly is detected: then insert your finger into that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white belly and the testicle, and between the second belly and the whole of it to the adhesion which is on the posterior part of the belly.
Then move with your right hand inwards the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white belly upwards, with your left hand: and lift up the gut with the belly up to the part of the section: and command the minister, that he extend the gut upwards: and you will solve the adhesion which is at the back of the complete solution
And inquire with your fingers, that there be nothing there of the intestine in the white belly or hard If however you find something there: then drive it downwards to the lower belly.
Then take hold of the clamp, in which is a thick thread made of ten threads: and insert it at the back of the gut, that is, the layer which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the section: then cut off the extremities which protrude from the thread, until there remain four threads. Then make a loop of some of them over some with the shape of a cross: and ligate with that which we have mentioned, that is the ligament of the gut which is under the skin of the testicles, until it does not have anything of the things which nourish them send to them anything: that there not be an accumulation of bad blood. And lay again the second ligament outside the first ligament, its length being less than two fingers from it. And afterwards two ligaments let go from the sheath, which is under the testicles, as much as the length of a finger; and incline the rest entirely according to the roundness, and take out from it all
And dry in the lower part of the skin of the testicles a section from which blood runs, and heal: thus as we have said before.
Then apply soft wool soaked in oil under the bandage, and put on a bandage: and administer the ligament which we mentioned. And when the white sheath which we mentioned has been cauterized, after its incision there is danger of bleeding from it. It often happens like this. And let go of the ligament until it falls away by itself
If however its case is delayed, then it is to be sewn up with warm water: and put over that which we mentioned, until it falls away
Then take care of the bandage with the rest of the treatment of the wound, until it has healed.
Chapter LXVI.
Of a wound with swelling.
In a wound there must not be anyone who has been reckless concerning its cure with a knife
And the first thing which they say is that it is like what we have said in the chapter concerning the Vite wound. That is, as a bandage is bound up after its section over that which is below: then dry in the middle, and care afterwards with that which opens it up until the bandages fall away: and care for the wound, as we have said, until it is healed
On the disruption that occurs in the groin.
On the disruption that occurs in the groin.
When a disruption occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the place is prominent, and does not descend to the testicles anything from the intestines: and if it descends, it is little, and returns in every hour: however, if it is prolonged with that time, a tear is added in the groin, until the intestines descend into the groin.
And this occurs from the extension of the groin, which is in the groin, as we have said That is, because the groin is extended: then it is softened, and the place is prominent, and the place protrudes.
And its care is with cautery, as its narration preceded.
And sometimes it is cured with iron, in this way: and the patient lies on his back between your hands Then dry the place of the disruption which is prominent and prominent, by cutting across its width, according to the quantity of three fingers wide.
Then string the intestines and those which are under the skin, until the white intestine is detected, which is under the skin following it
Then take a sponge, and put it over the place that protrudes from the groin, and press it into the depth of the belly
Then two places are made prominent at the end of the sponge from the groin, and they are stitched together with one stitch with the other: then the end of the sponge is removed
And do not cut the intestines at all, neither stretch them out or do anything else, as I have told you in the care of intestinal branches.
Then care for the wound. When you have finished cutting the thread, bind up the wound, and restore the part, until it is consolidated
Do not press too hard, and do not add any prominence of the rupture
And the cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to the flesh
Chapter LXVIII.
Regarding the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many people soften the skin of the testicles because of the meat that is between them, and it makes their appearance better.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is treating this case, to make the patient lie down on his back, and to cut away the whole skin that has been softened over the natural skin
Then join together two lips with a suture: and if you will, sew over the excess of the softened skin with three sutures, or four, and tighten the suture.
Then cut between the sutures.
Then care for the care of the remaining wounds until they are healed, and take out the thread.
Chapter LXIX
Regarding Castration
You know that castration is forbidden in our law: and for this reason I will not mention it in this book: and it is not necessary to mention it, except for two cases.
Of which one is that it is in the science of medicine when it is asked about it: and to know its treatment when it happens
And the other is that we often do not approve of castration for some animals, because of our laws concerning them, such as horses, donkeys, and cats, and similar animals.
I say therefore, that the Castration is accomplished in two ways. Or by excision. Or by cutting, and sectioning.
But in that way which is done by attrition, the operation is: we shall make the animal sit in warm water, until the testicles soften and relax, and hang down: then we shall grasp the testicles with our hands, until they are resolved and do not appear under the touch
In castration by cutting and sectioning, it is necessary to hold the animal firmly, and press the skin of the testicles with the left hand.
Then tie the cord, and dry over every wound a single stitch, until two testicles have descended: then cut through them after you have excised both, and do not leave anything outside except for the fine blood vessels that are above the testicles.
And this way of castration is better than that which is done by attrition: for in attrition there is a risk that something will be left behind from the testicles, which the animal may desire for coitus.
Then care for the wound, until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
There are two methods for the care of Hermaphrodites.
A hermaphrodite is of two kinds from the urine One of them is that it appears in the urine which follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, a figure like that of a female vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes the urine runs from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one kind, which is like the female vulva over the belly like small testicles all over: one of them is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles
And the treatment of the three species, two from males and one from females, is: because it is necessary that you cut the added flesh until the impression of them is driven out. And then care for the remaining wounds.
As for the second kind of men from whom urine comes, which is in the testicles, there is no operation, nor any treatment for it at all
Chapter LXXI
Concerning the incision of the tentorium and the protruding flesh in the women's wounds
The tentorium sometimes adds above the natural thing, until it becomes swollen and unsightly: and sometimes it grows large in some women so that it expands like in the males, and persists until the coitus.
Therefore it is necessary to cut away the superfluous tentorium either with one incision or two: and do not delay the incision, especially not at the root: so that there does not occur the flow of blood
And then care for the wound itself until it is healed
The flesh which is born in the belly-opening is called the navel: and sometimes it comes out to the outside like the tail: and because of this some call it a tail-wound Therefore it is necessary to cut the navel as we cut the tentorium, and care for it until it is healed
Concerning the care of the unperforated wound of a woman.
Chapter LXXII
The unperforated wound of a woman is called the alratica, either because it is unperforated, or because it has a small hole It is either natural or accidental.
It is either natural or accidental.
The knowledge of that is done by the aspect of obstetrics, if the opening appears close at hand.
If it is not apparent, then inquire with your fingers or with the aid of an image.
If it is from a fine powder and is close to two teeth: then grasp it, and break it.
And it is like placing two teeth over each other.
Then place your two index fingers of both hands together, and the woman should spread her buttocks. Then stretch out the two lips with force, until the fine powder is broken and the opening is opened
Then take wool and soak it in oil, and put it on the place: and the woman should take every day, so that it does not harden in that place
If the powder is thick and spiky: then it is necessary to remove it with a scraper like the broad leaf of myrtle.
If the opening is from natural flesh: then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and there should be with you medicines that flow blood without causing damage, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus aggregated with alum or chalk
Then give a wide lead pencil so that it does not harden too quickly, keep it for a few days: and give an ointment of dry linen, then care for the rest with treatment until it heals
And when the birth of flesh occurs in the womb with the growth of other flesh: it is necessary that they be cut away in this manner: for as long as there is no cancerous tumor upon the tumor which is in the womb, there is no contradiction with the use of iron in every case.
Chapter 73.
Concerning the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red in women's veins.
Hemorrhoids are indeed tears of the veins, until blood flows out of them in great quantity
When they are thus diminished, hemorrhoids become little hills: and I have already spoken of the signs of these, and of what receives treatment from them, and of what does not
I say, concerning hemorrhoids that are in the belly opening and are not visible: there is no treatment for them with iron
Those which are in the belly opening above which sense is lost, are those which are cured
It is necessary that you put the woman into a cold house Then extend the hemorrhoid with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut away the roots from them.
Then powder over the wounds with powder from one of the cuts without causing damage: like acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus, and the like of these things
Then compel her feet to the wall for one hour Then put her in cold water
If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and nutmeg, and gall, and the like of these things.
Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it over his back.
If blood is shed with it, it is good: and if not, make it adhere to the swollen parts, and blisters, without incisions.
Then take wool, and soak it in the juice of tartar, or in the juice of aloe, or in the juice of mustards, that is, alum, wine of Potiers, and make it adhere to the wound
When the swelling subsides, then care for the place with unguents, until it heals.
But indeed red is like heads of garlic, and is rough in appearance.
It is necessary therefore that you cut away what appears from it, according to what I have said previously: and care for it, until it heals
Head seventy-four.
Regarding the perforation that occurs in the matrix.
Many kinds of swellings occur in the matrix, such as cancer, and stone abscess, and ulcer, and tumours, and carbuncles, and haemorrhoids, and piles, and phlegmas, and abscesses, and fistulas
And I have also mentioned all these ailments and their signs and their treatments in detail: it is necessary to say in this treatise the abscess which occurs in the matrix when it is caused by other swellings, and how to open it with an iron
It is necessary to consider this carefully. Then if the pain of the swelling is acute with percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it turning red: if it falls over its senses, do not attempt to open it: care for it with what helps its maturation, until the acute symptoms have subsided
Then it is necessary that you make her sit upon a seat which beats two seats, and that she recline, or that she be supported upon her back, and that she bring her feet to the lower part of the belly: and that her knees be spread wide, and that she place her arms under her knees, and that she bind both ligaments conveniently to that.
Then the midwife sits on the right side, and manages the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
And it is necessary when you are administering this instrument, that the liver rests upon the deep part of the woman's womb: so that it is not injured by the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and that it does not pain the lower part
But if the instrument is thicker than the depth of the womb, then you must place sponges upon the covering of the deep part of the womb: so that the entrance of the instrument is not completely in the deep part of the womb: and you must place a plug, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and you must hold the instrument, and must rotate the minister of the plug, until the deep part of the womb is opened.
When it appears the opening and the hand touch each other, and is soft and gentle: then it is necessary that you cut her off at the head with a broad spatula.
When the blood is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a soaked sponge in rose oil: or in olive oil, in which there is some astringency: and put the sponge in, and draw out the section from the deep part of the womb
And put externally upon the womb, and upon the flank a wet towel soaked in water, in which there are bad bubbles.
Then he cares for two days with an unguent which agrees with it, until it is healed.
When the matrix and the vulnus have been bathed, let it be cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of lily, or long aristolochia, has been boiled: then return to the unguent.
If the vulnus is hidden inside the matrix, then it is necessary to restrain its cure with iron, and to care for it in the way we mentioned in the discourse
Chapter LX.
Concerning the treatment of the embryos of the womb, according to an unnatural form of birth.
It is necessary for the Obstetrician to recognize at first the figure of a natural birth.
From the signs therefore it is known that when a woman is pressed downwards by the fetus and she wishes to smell the air, and she lets out a fart above what is below concerning the birth, and she hastens the exit of the fetus: then you know that this birth is natural, and that the head is delivered first, and the second with it, or that it is suspended or hanging from the navel
When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press the belly, so that the fetus descends quickly.
For when it descends over the head, the second part descends with it, and they proceed from these superabundances in a good delivery
Whoever is beyond this birth is unnatural and dangerous
For when the fetus comes out over its feet, and its body comes out before the head, and the feet and the hands together, or one leg alone: or that the head and the hand come out: or that the belly comes out: and perhaps it turns over on its neck, and other similar things of an unnatural birth
It is necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent, attentive in all these matters, and to beware of error and negligence: I demonstrate every figure from these [anatomical structures] and their quality, and this is signified by this, and I stand above them.
When the fetus emerges upon its head during natural birth and the head presses upon the woman, and delivery becomes difficult, and the strength of its virtue is weakened: then let her sit down, or let the women hold her: and let steam rise with vinegar and decocted fennel, and with oily substances.
Then the obstetrician inserts his fingers between the ribs of the small space [uterus] and finds the second [uterine] ligament, and he severs it with his nail, until it is cured of the moisture: and he grasps the belly of the woman, until the fetus descends
If it does not descend, then it is necessary to administer a cupping [of vinegar and fennel] to the woman with slippery earth.
Then command her to lie down after the cupping, so that she may be supported: and let her breathe steadily for an hour with her eyes closed and her nose and mouth shut.</start_of_turn> The fetus will immediately come out.
If two hands of the fetus come out at once, it is necessary to reduce them gradually with ease.</start_of_turn> If it does not yield to the introduction, then let the woman sit down and lift her feet up high: then command her to sit down on the earth: and the woman should be held, lest she should fall upon the ground.</start_of_turn
If the hands do not come out and the fetus dies: then cut open the abdomen and extract the fetus: and tie off its hand with a cloth and extract it with equal force: for it will come out by itself.</start_of_turn>
The fetus has emerged from its feet. When the fetus emerges from its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards: afterwards it must be gradually turned over: finally it should be evened out with the other side.
Then grasp one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When it has emerged up to the hips, then order it to bend forward, so that the limbs are compressed together: it will then come out, if God wills it.
And if it does not come out as we have described, then gradually reduce the fetus until you have restored it to its natural position For indeed it will come out on its own when the time is right.
If it is being obstructed as we have described: then grasp from the thick mucus above, and with sponges and salves, and pierce the whole thing through the uterus with a good blow: then draw out with the hand of a woman and the lower part of the belly Then make it sit in warm water, until the afterbirth follows
When its lower parts are softened by the heat, then make for it a sieve of myrrh: and support it. When an hour has passed since it was put on the sieve, then make it sit on a seat Then order it to breathe: and bind its jaws and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with ease For the fetus will come out immediately.
The fetus has emerged from its knees and hands When it has emerged in this form, then gently draw in its hands gradually. Then the woman rests upon her thigh, and her feet hang down towards her: and she lies upon the bed, and clasps her hands together. Then press gently upon her belly Then draw out what is under her feet from the shoes, until it is prepared in the lower part If the fetus does not come out, then grasp her feet and move them with force Then press gently upon what is above the navel until the fetus ascends to the upper part Then insert your hands and equalize the fetus gradually: and command the woman to breathe, until the fetus comes out
The fetus comes out laterally hanging from the hands Skill is in the reduction of her hand If, however, it is not possible to reduce the hand, then lift the woman up and make her walk.
If she is unable to walk, then make her lie upon the bed: and compress her legs with force
Then administer the liniment which you prepared from the slime
If she bears a part, then make her sit upon a seat Then study in the reduction of the hand, and equalize the fetus according to its natural figure: and command the woman to breathe steadily, and tell her to press herself, until the fetus comes out.
The fetus comes out upon her thigh, with her hands expanded, and her face is towards the back of her mother The Obstetrician must hold the hand of the fetus, then slowly turn it around and equalize it easily.
When the edges are equal, then put over it the oil and mucus which we mentioned from the olive and slime.
Then command him to move slowly. When you have done this, then make him sit down on a seat, and command him to lean to his right side Then command him to cough: and make him strain with his chest puffed out
The fetus is ready to come out on the right side When it has descended to the opening of the womb in this way with the second finger, then cut the second finger with your nail until it is evacuated from the moisture.
If it hangs on the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained and does not die.
Then push the fetus inwards, until you place the second finger as it should be: and command the woman to press her hand lightly: for he himself will come out through the easy exit
The exit of twins, or of many fetuses. You know that twins are often born together: and sometimes three and four are born together. This is an unusual thing, and rarely happens.
Five things are outside of nature, and do not dwell together: and they continue to exist, although multiplied, one with another: and they are separated by the navel of each one
And sometimes they come out like a single fetus through a natural exit: easily: and they come out through the difficult exit, as we have mentioned.
If any of these things are difficult at the part, and they reach that which we mentioned from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have narrated: and let there be a sober stewardess, and let her do what she does with ease and delay, and adapt to every figure as she is prepared from the leading mind to safety.
Remember that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and is aborted
When it is formed in the womb one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten: and it has been verified by me that a woman has aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of them were formed
Which is done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore all this must be in the science of Obstetrics. Perhaps it will come to a similar thing like this: oppose it with that which must be opposed.
Chapter 76
On the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you care for a dead fetus with that which I mentioned in the discourse from medicine, and it does not go out, and you must do as with the hand, then you must consider it
If a woman is of sound virtue and is not with any of the accidents from which they are afraid that she will lose her life: then it must be that she rest on the bed, on her back, and that her head be inclined downwards, and her legs be raised: and the minister should hold her hand from two parts, or bind her to the bed, so that her body is not extracted with the fetus
Then moisten the os matrice with oily things with high mucus, and fennel, and linseed seed.
Then let the obstetrician wet his hand with these oils and mucilages, and then introduce it into the matrix with ease. Then seek the place where the ribs rest from the fetus, and the convenient location for it
Consider therefore then, if the fetus is ready to descend over its head: then fix the ribs to its eyes, or to its neck, or to its mouth, or to its palate, or under its beard, or under its chest, or in the neighboring parts of the ribs, and under the hypopontes.
If however the descent is over its feet, then in the flanks, and the middle ribs.
And it is necessary to hold the hook with the right hand: and place the handle of the hook in that which is between the little finger of the left hand: and introduce it with the hand with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places which we mentioned, until it reaches the desired thing.
Then fix the other hook, or the third one if necessary: so that there is an equal contraction, and does not incline to the side.
Then extend the extension equally, and do not let the extension be only according to the straight line, but rather move towards all parts, so as to alleviate its exit: just as it is done with a tooth in its extraction
And it is necessary in that which is between these, to soften the extension Which if it is retained from that side, then let the obstetrician grasp any finger with oil, and introduce it from the side, so that it may recoil with that which is retained
If therefore the part of the fetus comes out, then exchange the hooks to another place which is higher: do this until the fetus comes out completely
If, therefore, the hand departs from its place before the other, and reduction is impossible on account of its adhesion: then it is necessary that the former should be included over the latter. If therefore the hand departs before the other, and reduction is impossible because of its adhesion: then it is necessary that the former should be included over the latter.
If the fetus's head is large, or if adhesion occurs to it on egress, or there is water collected in its head: then it is necessary that the surgeon insert between the fingers a thorny sponge and press it against the head, and extract the water: or break it with the instrument called Almisdac, which has a form similar to that of the other instruments in this chapter.
Similarly do as in the case of a large-headed fetus: then it is necessary that the membrane be separated from the head: or that the head be extracted with the forceps, as we have said Then draw out the bones with forceps.
If the head departs and adheres to the rib cage: then it is found until the moisture which is in the chest is expelled.
If it does not complicate, and does not yield to extraction: then truncate the head as much as possible, as far as possible.
If the lower part of the belly is affected by swelling, or there is swelling in it: then it is necessary to perforate it, until the moisture from it is expelled
If the fetus lies above his feet: then its traction is easy, and its direction towards the maternal bones is smooth.
If, however, it adheres to the belly, or to the chest: then it is necessary to extract it with the bandage which you included over your hand: and find the belly, or the chest, until the adhesion is relieved
If, however, the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns: then the Obstetrix inserts his left hand inside. If the mouth of the uterus is open, then he inserts his hand into the depth of the uterus, and seeks with it the head, and pulls it out with the fingers until it reaches the os of the uterus: then he inserts into it one or two fingers and pulls them out with it.</start_of_turn>
If the os of the uterus is closed, because of a thick clot that has happened to it: then it is not necessary to labour above it, but it is necessary to administer an effusion of fluids, fatty: and administer plasters: and sit in waters which soften and moisten.</start_of_turn>
If the fetus is over its side, then it is possible to equalize it: then it is administered what we said concerning the fetus above.</start_of_turn
If it is not possible to do this, then it is done hastily, and it is extracted.</start_of_turn
And it is necessary that you do not let anything out of the second part entirely.</start_of_turn>
When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said concerning the postpartum calices which happen in the uterus.</start_of_turn
If bleeding occurs, then descend into the waters of styptics, and administer the rest of the treatment.</start_of_turn
And indeed I saw a woman in whose womb a fetus had died: then she was impregnated above her with another, afterwards another fetus also died.</start_of_turn This happened to her after a long time there was a clot in her navel, and it became inflated, until it opened: and it began to emit pus.</start_of_turn
I have been called to his aid, and I have treated him for a long time: and it has not healed.
I have placed above him some strong adhesive plasters: and it has come out of its place.</start_of_turn> Then some days passed by, and it came out again.</start_of_turn> I am amazed at this, since there is no bone there.</start_of_turn>
I think that these were the bones of a dead fetus.</start_of_turn>
I asked about the wound, and I extracted many bones, the woman being in a better state of health: and I have treated it thus for a long time, and it has healed in a small quantity.</start_of_turn
And I did not confirm this foreign body, except that in it there is knowledge, and an assistant with an artificial hand for the cure.</start_of_turn
Chapter 77.</start_of_turn
¶ On the forms of the necessary instruments for the extraction of a fetus.</start_of_turn>
Two additional things are introduced into the cavity of the bone, so that it opens when you reverse two Vertigines.
Here below is the form of the Strictor, by which books are equaled, which has two hooks in two extremities of two sticks that are equal.</start_of_turn But it must be known that this Vertigo must be subtler than the Strictor: and that it may be made either of ebony or of seasoned wood.</start_of_turn
And the breadth of every stick is like two fingers: and the margin of each of them is like a thumb, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two sticks are two projections of the same kind of stick, which are fixed in both, whose length is half a palm and a little, and the breadth of each is like two fingers, or less.</start_of_turn
Two additional things are introduced into the matrix of the bone, so that it opens when you reverse two Vertigines.
Two additional things are introduced into the cavity of the bone, so that it opens when you reverse two Vertigines.
They are made from the wood or bone of the tooth, or according to the likeness of pincers Two additional things are introduced at its extremity, as mentioned above: and the length of each additional thing is like the palm of the hand, and the width of each is like two fingers.
When you thus reverse two Vertigines, then make the woman sit on the lectum, with her feet hanging down, and open what is between her thighs. Then introduce these two additional things together into the cavity: and you hold the lower extremity of the instrument between her thighs Then open your hand with the instrument, like you do with pincers, equally according to the quantity that you wish to open the cavity of the bone, until the Obstetrix does what he wishes
The other form of the Vertigines is like the ancient form of the Impelling Force which drives the fetus forward
The shape of the Almond, which counters the large head: and it is assimilated to the pincer, which has teeth at its extremity, like the above.
And when it is bent, like the pincers according to this form, like the above, which has teeth like saw teeth, with which it incides and counteracts
The form of the neighbour who has a spinna (needle) one.
The form of the neighbour who has needles two.</start_of_turn>
The form of the spatula which has two extremities to bind the head.</start_of_turn
The form of two spatulas also of the hands.</start_of_turn
These instruments are all used, and the more they are multiplied in kinds, and are prepared by the artificer, the more rapid is the operation and the greater is its excellence among men, because of their quantity.</start_of_turn
Do not disdain any of these instruments, because they are prepared for you.</start_of_turn It is not excusable that these are necessary.</start_of_turn
Head seventy-eight.</start_of_turn
About the extraction of the second.</start_of_turn
When the second is retained during delivery, then it is necessary to pull down the lower parts, so that it may retain its breath.</start_of_turn Then do you make him groan with constraint: and stretch out your hand over his bone, and grasp his breath.</start_of_turn If he thus departs through this, it is good.</start_of_turn
If not: then take hold of all, and pierce in the belly a hole: and place in it herbs that will open the bone, such as calamus, rue, and fennel, chamomile, and alum, and cassia gum, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them over fire.</start_of_turn
Then place an embolus of Arundis over the opening of the coloplast pot, and the other extremity in the bone of the uterus: and keep it there until the vapor has escaped to the cavity of the uterus.
Then make a seal, as we have said before It will come out easily by itself.
If, however, it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then order the Obstetrician, that he immerse his hand in the bowels of the belly, or in thick mucus. Then he introduces it into the belly, and seeks with it the Second When he has found it, then he grasps it, and pulls it out slowly
If, however, it be an appendix in the depth of the belly, then he introduces the hand, as we have said before, until he has found the Second: and he pulls it out slowly, until it is found. It must be drawn out straight, so that the womb does not tear from the pulling. It is necessary therefore that it be moved with ease to the right and left sides: then add in quantity the attraction. It will obey you then, and will be cured, and will go away from the adhesion
If the bone of the uterus is contracted, as we have said before: care for it with sealing, and with a pot with herbs.
If, however, it does not come out with all that we have said: do not be rash in your handling of it in your attempt to extract it.
It is necessary, however, that what comes out to the bone of the uterus should be bound to the woman's hip bone. Then bind up the wound with unguent tetrapharmacon It will be putrefied on this side after a day, and will dissolve and depart.
When it has putrefied, it will emit a foul odor from the belly and head, and will cause illness. Therefore, it is necessary to apply appropriate fumigations to it.
Some of the ancients have experience with fumigation using naphtha and powdered gypsum.
The way in which a woman is fumigated during the retention of the second and menstrual periods.
It is done like a lamp, or from a wick: and the wide end is placed over the flame: and the fumigation is placed over the berries: it should be held there until the fumigation has been consumed; and do it again
Chapter LXXIX.
Regarding the unpierced animal.
Many boys are born with unpierced holes, whom I have treated with subtle sponges It is necessary therefore that the midwife pierce that hole with her finger: and if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula: and take care not to touch it
Then put over it fat infused in wine and wax Then take care of it with nails until it heals
If indeed it is to be pilled, then put in the hole a lead cannula for several days, and take it out when the child wants to urinate.
And also the piling of an animal may occur from the consolidation of the wound, or from a fistula. It is necessary therefore to drain that consolidation, and then care for it as we have said above concerning the treatment and lead
On the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
On the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Fistulas which occur in the lower part are Nodulation and Swelling which arise close to every limb: either in the space of one part or in several parts.
When the nodulation has been removed, it is opened up, and white aqueous moisture or subtle pus flows out from it
And when there are penetrating fistulas from these things. They are recognized as penetrating by the discharge which comes out of them, by the swelling, when the patient vomits; and sometimes they come out with worms
And there are fistulas from these things when they are penetrating up to the belly and up to the marrow of the bone And they are penetrating from these things up to the hip joint, and up to the node of the buttocks
From this, however, it is known that a penetrating fistula up to a limb, even if not penetrating, is when you put your finger on the limb and press slightly into the fistula from the air or with iron: when there is no distortion
When there is distortion, then introduce into the fistula a slight lead weight, or a hair from a horse's tail, until you feel pressure, or a hair on your finger
If you do not feel the pressure, neither does anything come out of the discharge, neither swelling, nor worms as I have said: then you know that it is not penetrating: suffice it therefore for treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating up to the belly or up to the bladder: then its meaning is the escape of urine from it, and the prohibition of this so that the place may be consolidated with the doctors.
If it reaches the hip joint or the hip bone: then its sign is that it will cause the limb to hang down, if there is no twist in it up to the bone. And there is pain around the part, and pus always comes out of it; and it does not heal with medicine, neither is it consolidated with ointment.
In all these penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure: the cure for them is toil and perseverance, from the fools of doctors who make them.</start_of_turn>
But in those which are neither penetrating nor old, hope for healing is expected with rest: as I have said before, and as I have proved: that the patient should lie between your hands over his back, and lift his limbs up to above his hips, and that his hips should be inclined towards his belly.</start_of_turn> Then introduce lead or air, if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know where the limb hangs down.</start_of_turn>
If the patient feels pain around the part, then it is necessary to insert your finger as an index into the part.</start_of_turn>
If you feel the limb being pierced by your finger itself, as well as between your finger and the flesh, or between the flesh and bone: then you know certainly that it is penetrating: it is not in vain that we have said that it does not heal.</start_of_turn>
They say that in some people the wound heals by itself, and with the expectation of treatment, that is, to apply a subtle cautery according to the size of the fistula, and to introduce the flame into the fistula until the pain around the part ceases.</start_of_turn> Then do it again two or three times, until you know that all the added flesh that is like the twig of a bird's feather has been consumed.</start_of_turn
Then care for the wound with butter until the fatty tissues depart: then care for the wound with unguents generating flesh and solidifying it.
If it heals well, that is good.</start_of_turn>
And if not, then it will not heal with any other treatment.</start_of_turn>
And if it comes out, and does not remain until it reaches your finger, which is in the armpit, and is between the space of your armpit and your breast, or if there is a thick piece of flesh adhering to it: then make an incision at the surface of the skin following the fistula, then dry the skin from the start of the incision, and dry with the finger which is in the fistula until the drying reaches the extremity of the finger, and the finger is freed and falls off.</start_of_turn>
Then soften the filtered tissues which absorb the bristles of the quill of birds, so that nothing remains of them.</start_of_turn>
If however it bleeds, and you solve between you and the operation that you should cut away those tissues: then it is better that you do this quickly, either by cauterization with fire or with acute medicine.</start_of_turn>
For indeed cauterization with fire aggregates good habits, adds nourishment to those tissues which have been added, and closes the bleeding, and dries the humors.</start_of_turn
Then care for the wound with butter or poultices until the place emits pus, and the fatty tissues depart in pus.</start_of_turn
Then care for the wound with solidifying and generating flesh unguents: these are medicines which have stypticity and drying qualities.</start_of_turn
When restoration is complete, then healing follows: and not by repetition.
When the fistula persists deeply within the body and extends from the superabundance of the body: then insert your finger into the rectum and inquire concerning it.
If, however, you feel resistance, and between you and the other there is a wound of fat or flesh, and it is close to the penetration: then there is no operation in that, except according to the measure of trust and hope.
For indeed in that one must administer three things: either that you cauterize it yourself, as we have said: or that you cut it away, until you have reached its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert instruments and perform the cure from the next time And do not proceed too much with the incision, lest you cut through the tissue containing the rectum, and cause an excessive discharge of feces without the patient's consent. Then care for that as we have said.
Perhaps indeed it will heal: or you will lengthen that wound, and cleanse it when it is dry until it is close to the rectum, as we have said, or with your finger, or with an acute instrument. Then remove the bloody flesh which is in the incision, until the bone is clearly visible with the scalpel.
Then attempt to restore the entire wound with the incision, and the upper orifice where consolidation has occurred: and the fistula will remain open in the inner part of the anus, and will be less harmful over the infirmity.
And when you suture the fistula in this way: and it is when you insert your finger into the fistula: and it is on the side of the rectum around the surface of the body with skin and margin of the rectum: then grasp the perforation at the tip, which is like a nail, that is, prepared for cutting through the skin, in this shape And introduce into the body the involucrum of five threads, and circle them around. And introduce a tension with a thread into the fistula, until its concavity follows its course
If there is a perforation in the inner margin of the anus, then withdraw the thread from that opening: so that you may introduce your finger into the anus, and withdraw the end of the thread, and join the two ends together: and tighten both of them, and let that go on one day, or two days: and the more the thread has gone into the flesh, the more tightly you must tighten it, until those parts of the flesh which are between the two ends of the thread have become soft and fallen away: then care for the wound, until it has healed and become whole again.
If, however, the opening of the fistula is not a perforation: then make it penetrate in whatever way you prepare it, except that it should not be in very deep And do not make it penetrate too deeply, for you may thereby cause damage to it
Then do as we have said, until it has healed
Make a sponge-shaped cushion for the fistula, whose curvature is acute at one end and obtuse at the other, so that it does not damage that which is not necessary, like urine
Chapter 81.
Concerning the stitching of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from the incision of them: and the care of the incisions.
There are hemorrhoids of two kinds. Either they are within the anus, like the stones of a pomegranate or plums: or they are like the seeds of a date palm And there are small and large hemorrhoids: and blood always flows from them, and there is one, and there are many of them And there are outside the knee, and at its extremities.
And these which are outside the knee, are for the most part a few drops of moisture from which yellow bile or blood flows slowly: and they are according to the colour of the body.
And the treatment of that which is inside the knee, is that you must urge the patient to walk: and evacuate, until the anus comes out, and there appear to you be little ones. Therefore do you also suspend with hooks: or hold with your finger And then strike at the root of them.
If indeed they do not remain in the loop, because of the moisture of them and their softening: then cover them with coarse cloth, or with wool felt, and draw them out with your fingers And then strike at the root, and powder over them after incision whatever fine powders are warm, that they may remain in place like cauterization. Or cauterize them according to what has been said in the chapter of cauterization. And then care for the knee until it heals.
And if the anus does not come out, then instill the patient with a small enema in which there is a little biting, so that it may be driven out quickly, when the patient presses himself
If indeed the little ones are outside the anus, then the matter is easy and light: and it is as if you grasp them with your finger, or grasp them with a loop, and strike at them. And then care for the knee as we have said, until it heals
And he who dislikes incision with the sword, must know how to administer suture according to this manner. Grasp the slippery thread and introduce it into the wound. Then draw out the little thread towards the upper part, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the opposite side: and pass two extremities of the thread through the lower part of the needle, and let them lie parallel: and tighten the little thread with a strong suture. Then knot the thread and draw out the needle.
Do this with all the little threads, and let go of one: do not keep it, as it may cause excessive bleeding.
Then place above any soaked dressing on the blood-soaked area, or on cotton wool, and place it above the wound: and command the patient to rest. Then let go of it, until it is healed.
When the little threads are healed, care for the incisions with unguents, and remain with the patient until healed
(End of excerpt Many times these occur from the swelling of the bowels, and the constriction of the natural order.)
When these things are present, and do not yield to medical treatment: then it is necessary to apply sponges soaked in vinegar or with your finger, until they become soft, and the outer layer is removed, which hinders the healing.) Then care for the wound, until it is consolidated as it should be.)
If, however, they do not consolidate: then repeat the wound with greater reason than before, until they bleed much, and are then cleansed; care for the wound again until it is healed.)

Chapter 82.
Know that the Almirmar is not except a round node according to the colour of the body, like the head of a nail: and it is found throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and the fingers: and it arises from the matter of pain in walking.
Therefore it is necessary to cut away what is around the nail, and to hold it with forceps or with a needle, and to eradicate it from its root
Then care for it: and if you wish, cauterize it according to what is before mentioned in its chapter.
And from the heel there is a small, rough, filtered, round elevation on the surface of the body. And they often happen in the hands of children.
And its care is to extend the heel and cut it through: or to ligate it with a silken thread: or with a hair, until it falls off.</start_of_turn> And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said before with fire, or with acute medicine: and thus the heel will be eradicated both forwards and backwards, not backwards only with the instrument which I have mentioned.</start_of_turn>
There is also a small, filtered elevation, large, on the surface of the body, which is wide downwards: and when it is affected by cold, it is felt in it like the bite of a flea, and it is found throughout the body: and most of it happens in the hands.</start_of_turn
And its care is to take a needle from the wing of a gull, or a strong feather: and put it on the Flea, until the circle of the needle contains the circumference of the Flea.</start_of_turn Then withdraw your hand with the cannula until you have severed what is around the ant: and place it into the depth of the flesh, and extract the ant from its root.
If you wish, do this with an air cannula or a metallic one, according to this form.</start_of_turn>
Let the upper part of the cannula be at the level of the nail which is being grasped, so that it may be both grasped and withdrawn easily.</start_of_turn>
And if you wish, burn the ant according to what is stated concerning the cautery of the mole in the chapter on cautery.</start_of_turn>

When the testicles are swollen from silver, or gold, or blown glass, or malleated.</start_of_turn
And when these instruments are of small or large size, according to those in which they are administered.</start_of_turn

Large testicles.</start_of_turn
The upper part of this cannula, that is, the head in which the uterus is tied, should be broad according to this manner: and there should be a distinction so that the uterus is tied like water, and the lower extremity which enters the belly should be deaf, that is, not open, soft, yielding, drawn to thinness: and on one side there are two holes, and on the other side a single hole.</start_of_turn
The width of the opening should be according to the length of the rays, neither too large nor too small. And let there be a space in which to place the instruments from the belly of the animal: or from parchment of the wing, which is according to the form of the asofrat of the hen. And its root is the palm of one.
The hole is pierced with many holes as it turns around, and there is space between every hole the size of a finger Then insert into the hole a strong thread from a strong thread, which is from ten threads, or about these, and join with it as with an asofrat. When it is thus placed in that space, string it in the head of the clip between two points of constriction. And then clip it with it.
This is the form of the circle which is here depicted, and of the holes
The quality of the clipping with it is: that you implement both the belly or the belly from the medicine, which is warmed according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance: and take care that it is neither too hot nor too cold, nor too cold.
Then the patient is placed on his back, and lifts his legs upwards: and place under it the intestines, that is, the skin over which people lie, or linen.
Then join the extremity of the clip with bile, or with alum or with the mucilage of barley, or similar. Then insert it into the belly with ease Then take hold of the belly with two hands and press it out with your thumbs, until it has evacuated all that is in the clip into the intestine
Then extract the Clistere, and elevate the patient's limbs towards the wall.
If the physician thinks it is necessary to remove it, then hold it as much as possible.</start_of_turn> If he sleeps all night with it, it is the most harmful thing.</start_of_turn>
But if you wash the Clistere with the solution of the bowels, and it comes out: then repeat the Clistere until it is healed.</start_of_turn
If there are hemorrhoids or painful swelling in the rectum, then let the Clistere be gentle and soft, from the Clisteres which are used to treat children.</start_of_turn
And this is the way of the gentle Clistere which is not strict on the skin.</start_of_turn
Head wound.</start_of_turn
I have spoken in the discourse about the treatment of wounds which agrees with the book, and I will speak here of the treatment of them with the hand and with the help of physicians.</start_of_turn
I say therefore, that wounds are varied according to that from which they arise, and according to the place where the wound falls.</start_of_turn
The wounds which arise from many things are like the blows of a stone: or the cutting of a sword or knife: or the percussion with a spear or wood or arrow: and like these from many things.</start_of_turn
But wounds which arise from the place of the body are like a wound which falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the limb: and like these from many things.</start_of_turn
I am also reporting on the treatment of certain wounds, in order to set out the ratiocination and rule concerning the rest of the wounds.
I shall begin with simple head wounds: for the memory of compound wounds will arise at the commencement of the third chapter
Thus I say. When a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from a piece of stone or something similar, and if only the skin is torn: and it is a great wound, and the time is great for an inflamed swelling to increase: then stop, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately: and do not delay this: and extract from him from the blood according to the quantity of his virtue: if there be nothing to prevent it, especially if there be little blood issuing from the wound. And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wound
And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wound And let the patient be warned against repletion, and wine, and coarse food
If, however, anything hinders the reduction [of the swelling], then let him abstain from food, and not approach meat or drink water
And place upon the wound if it happens to him a swelling of blood, a bandage infused in saffron alone, or with wine in which there is a styptic.
If, however, you are secure from the swelling being increased, then place upon the wound, if it is accompanied by blood, and it has not changed its nature, powder which I will tell you of later: and if it has changed its nature, then place upon it some unguent, until it is healed
If, however, the wound is great, or is from a cut with a knife, and the like: and the lips of it do not adhere by means of little hairs, then adhere them together with sutures, according as I shall tell you in the chapters concerning the sutures of wounds within
If, however, a vein has been detected by the bone, and hangs loose, and its retention is not possible, except in a small suspension: then cut it off. Care for the vein with the physicians, and restore it in the place of the skin, and command the patient to eat nourishing food, such as heads of garlic and cooked wheat, until the pulse returns: and similar things.
If you find in the flesh putrefaction, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the whole putrefied part, and throw it away: then care for the remainder
If, however, in his veins is an artery, or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by the physicians, then inquire about the artery. If, therefore, you find it unseamed, then sew it up with Spatumili, or bind it up. If necessity compels you when it does not confer what we have said, then burn it, until the blood is severed
If, however, these wounds are small and simple: then the matter is easy and light: so that you may powder over them this powder: because it consolidates them before they change them with air.
Method of applying the powdered medication.</start_of_turn> Recipe for olive oil, dragon's blood and burnt lime. Take one part of each, mix them thoroughly, and sprinkle over it: apply it to the wound and bind tightly, until it adheres well and clots with the blood.</start_of_turn>
Then stretch it out over feathers, and let it go, and do not soak it until it remains, for it will not adhere.</start_of_turn So it is not erased by this medicine until it has healed.
When it has made the stone sole, when there is neither of these in the present [ointment], and even dragon's blood does the same operation in many great wounds, when it happens that it is put on these and bound over, and there are recent wounds with their own blood, which have not altered the air.
When it has altered the air somewhat by its alteration, especially when it is in summer, then it is not in the position of this powder to retain its efficacy: therefore you must care for it along with this [medicine], so that you put upon it some digestive unguent: or you put upon it balls made of barley flour, made with water and honey, until they discharge pus Then care for the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If indeed it happens with a fractured bone in a limb, and it is small, then extract that with a hook: and I will tell you about the treatment of head fractures in this [text].
Of wounds of the head.
If indeed a wound happens in the head, then there is no difference between it and a wound of the head when it is simple.
If indeed a nerve or an artery is cut: then if it is a nerve, it is not in its wisdom to remove it, except as a remedy for its causing excessive bleeding, such as saffron, and rue, and things of that kind. For they know nerves, and they drive them away.
And do not put anything cold upon the wound in any way: for the substance of nerves is cold, and their continuity is with the brain, which is the soul of members: and this is how it is healed by physicians, such as stone dust with sweet water infused with some oil of almond, or with rose oil, and thiosin, when it is washed away even with sweet water: and the rest of the mineral stones, in this way, and moist unguents.
If, however, a wound is large, then manage the suture: or bind its lips with wool. Then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
If, however, the wound is deep, or if it lies in a recess of its lower part, in which pus is collected, then perforate it at a depressed place in that area.</start_of_turn
If, however, it has been cut in the wound, and blood flows from it: then separate it, or dry up the blood, and bind it: or cauterize it, if need be.</start_of_turn>
If, however, some of the intestines or all of them have been cut through, and the guts are hanging out: then gather the lip of the skin with the suture over the top of the gut, and do not touch the gut, but rather equalize it, and reduce it to its natural position.</start_of_turn> Then bind it tightly with a bandage, and let it go in a few days.</start_of_turn Then care for it with unguents in which there is stypticity and drying, until it heals.</start_of_turn
If, however, a wound has made an imprint in the bone, then examine it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract them all, or whatever can be separated from it: and what cannot be prepared, leave it, until the wound has healed, and the swelling has subsided.</start_of_turn
If, however, the wound has been burned, then powder over it the powder which I have mentioned.</start_of_turn If, however, bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula has formed: then care for it as is mentioned in its own chapter.</start_of_turn>
Of an ulcer in Spatulis.
If there is percussion of the lance or knife, and its blood is deep, then consider it seriously. If blood comes from the ulcer when the patient breathes, then you know that the ulcer is mortal
If it is not deep and blood comes with it: do not at once put powder on it, neither bind it up, lest the blood remain in its depth and be fatal. Put on it a strong unguentum and heal it in two days.</start_of_turn>
If there is no unguentum there, then put in the mouth of the ulcer a little wool, so that it may absorb what comes out of it from the humilities: and make the patient sleep over the ulcer so that it may heal what is gathered in it.</start_of_turn
If after three days, or more, the patient does not have a spasmus or tremor of the cord, nor a bad stricture in his breath, and has all the other symptoms good, then you know that the ulcer is healed.</start_of_turn Treat it with care and with remedies, and with other cures, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If in the end its healing is excused, and it always opens, then you know that there is a fistula.</start_of_turn Treat it from its chapter.</start_of_turn
And if the ulcer is from a wound of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it as if it were sutured, if it is large: or with powder if it is small.</start_of_turn
If, however, he has made an imprint in the bone, and it breaks off from it: then inquire about the nail, and prepare to extract that fragment, if it is separated. If it is not separated, then leave it, until the nail softens, so that the extraction may be easier.
The rest of the nails which have become loose in the other limbs, judgment concerning these is in the treatment, is the judgment which we have mentioned.
Concerning the nails of the belly, and the exit of the intestine, and the evacuation of them.
The fracture which happens in the belly is great, medium, or small.
From the great, indeed when the intestine comes out, or the number of intestines.
Therefore comes the introduction of the intestines, and the suture is more difficult and arduous
And the small fracture also becomes difficult in another way Therefore, it follows that the reduction of these is more difficult if you do not promptly restore them to their place in their introduction: for they become swollen, open, and thickened: therefore the entrance of them becomes difficult
Therefore, it is better to fracture the medium than the large or small: for with the medium, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is with the other two kinds
You know that the suture of the belly is according to four modes
Two sutures are common for the suture of the belly, and for the suture of the rest of the limbs: and two other sutures communicate with the rest of the limbs alone Truly are these things proper with the sutures of the belly: and I tell you one also with its explanation and declaration.
When a wound is small and something comes out of the intestine through it, it is difficult to reduce it: then that is because of one of two things. Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we have said: or because there is an inflation in the intestine because of the cold of the air.
When it is like this, it is necessary to heat it up, so as to soak the sponge or the cloth wet in warm water only Or boil in water a little barley, some pepper and some spike, and embrace with these the intestine, until the inflation is resolved.
When it makes this drink which has a astringency: and it is better than plain water in resolving the inflation.
When the inflation has been resolved, then moisten the intestine with the water in which it has been boiled, or with oil For in this way it makes the entrance of it with a little thing more gentle.
If however it is excused its return after this cure, then find in the disruption a little thing, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
The first cure is better when it is prepared, than a section: and does not make a forcing to cut after necessity and the defect of the instrument.
Let one part be acute, which is a circle, and the other part not acute, and the extremity soft should not be like that of Spatumilis, but rather be more obtuse like chaff: and that is like the almond, as the drink is like that.</start_of_turn>
When the wound is thus increased, and the intestine is introduced, then it is necessary to reduce it according to its natural form in its own place, if possible above it: for that is better.</start_of_turn>
When the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the patient lie upon his back, and raise his legs higher than his head. If it is in the upper part of the belly: then place his head high, and his chest higher than his lower parts
Similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly: then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which the wound is should be higher than the other part.
It is necessary in large wounds and in medium wounds.
In small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you
Then make present between your hands a more pious minister who holds the entire disruption with his hand: and join his lips together. Then draw from it that which follows the suture something after something: and this is the common way of stitching one.
And it is necessary to take an awl or the number of awls according to the quantity of the wound's breadth Then let go from the extremity of the disruption the quantity of the little finger, that is, the physician: and fix the awl one beyond what you put into the vein in two extremities of the skin, when two extremities are put through the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from another part, and you have gathered up two extremities of the skin, and two of the veins: and there are four orders formed
Then string with double thread around the circumference of the awl several times from two parts together, until two lips of the wound are gathered together by a decent aggregation.
Then let go of the length of the finger also, and fix in its place another one: afterwards draw back the thread with the needle, as you did with the first needle. Do not cease to do this until you have completed the constriction of the whole wound
And let there be medium-sized needles between the length and the thickness: because the fine needles easily slip through flesh: and the thick ones are difficult to pass through the skin: therefore it is necessary that there be medium-sized ones in the thickness, and length.
It is not to be permitted that the needle be fixed at two contiguous parts of the skin close to each other: that the flesh should not be pierced too quickly, and that the wound should not be opened before its consolidation, and that it should not be prolonged even with the suture, for fear of hindering the consolidation of the wound
Then cut off the ends of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient during his sleep: and put over it little balls of wool from all around, which will hold the ends of the needles: and let go of them, until you know that the wound is consolidated
And this kind of suture with needles of this sort is more convenient in small wounds For it is sufficient in the suture of these to make use of one needle, or two, or about as many as are needed.
The second suture is more common, that it joins together four extremities: two of skin and two of fat in one wound, with a needle in which the thread is equally distributed in thickness and length.
Then when you have pierced with the needle the four extremities, reduce the needle from the part from which you began, so that the retouched thread may fall from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture be like the suture of cloth which we make when we string up cloth, and put between every suture as much of the length of the smaller finger as is necessary
Men know this suture.
When such a suture has been made, men know that it is sufficient to bind up what has been wounded by the knife, which has caused a wound on the belly, and which has been torn away from its substance by the greater part of the palm of one hand: and that it has escaped from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and that there is a tear in the middle of the belly.
Therefore, I put it outside the wound for twenty-four hours
It was consolidated in the space of about fifteen days: and I cared for it, and it healed: and afterwards it remained sound for many years, being in its proper place.
And the doctors said that it would not heal
And by a miracle, I cured it without ointment Because I was in a place where unguent was not to be found, neither was there any of the physicians there I put upon the wound a coat of wool twice a day, and I bathed it with honey water until it healed
There are two kinds of sutures which I shall tell you about according to the narration of the sermon.
And it is like this: you begin with a sharp suture: and you pass the point from outside to the inside part
When you have thus pierced the skin, and in the wound you have made a loop according to the length and breadth of the whole body: you draw out the point of the needle in the side in which you put it in, and you make the point penetrate from the inside part to the outside in the opposite side.
When you have thus made the point penetrate, then make it penetrate once more in the same place from the outside part to the inside: and draw out the point which is in this side, and make the needle penetrate from the inside part to the outside in the opposite side: and make it penetrate just as you made it penetrate in the point of the needle which is in the side, until it penetrates the whole thing
Then commence from this side also from the same limb, and bring your finger along with the extremity, which is from the heel on the other side, and extract the point from the skin as it has penetrated.
Then reduce the limb to this side also, and bring your finger along with the extremity which is on the other side, with the heel: and extract the point from the skin which has penetrated, and make that part whole again and the other: and make that part whole after the other, until your entire limb is whole according to this example.
And the end of this suture is that you make your sutures like those which are made for the skin: so that you make one from one side of the limb and the other from the other side, until you have completed it.
The second kind of proper suture which Gale has said.
This is how he has said it, that you must make your sutures like some of the physicians do, because they collect every part in proportion to itself, and apply one extremity to the other extremity, and the heel to the other heel. And that is how it is done according to what I have told you.
It is necessary that you make the point of the needle penetrate from the outside inwards in this part, and that you draw out two extremities of the limb. Then withdraw the point and make the needle penetrate from the outside inwards through two extremities of the limb, namely both of them
Then withdraw both of them, and make them penetrate both from the inside outwards through the two other extremities which are on the opposite side
And this is the best way of making a suture, and is the suture which requires remembering
This is indeed the word of Galen.
Some have said this. The suture of the belly is corrected with two squares. That is, insert one thread into each of the two squares: and begin with the insertion of the needle from the side which is towards you, and make it penetrate until it reaches the opposite side, according to the suture which is to be made in the skin equally
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly: then the suture of that is more difficult than that of the rest of the belly
The judgment of the healing of a wound is the judgment of the rest of the wounds.
That is, when you follow the wound with its own blood, before it changes itself: and reduce the intestines, and touch it, and place over it the powder of burnt barley.
If the air has already changed the wound: then place over it some unguents which are present, until they make pus: and the threads fall out, and they are solidified with earth, and the matter is healed. Then care for it in the same way as the care of the rest of the wounds, until it is healed.
But if there are no medicines at hand, then place over it immediately, from which it begins to emit pus, a little bit wet: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
For you will not find any other medicine in many conditions, when the wounds are simple.</start_of_turn>
If however you are afraid that the wound communicates with the principal parts in the lesion, then you must plunge fine wool yarn into lukewarm oil, or in rose oil: and put it around the circumference of the parts which are between the groin and the flanks.</start_of_turn
If he feels pain, or swelling, or corruption in his intestines (for such things often happen to him), then let him drink a cluster of black vinegar, warm: especially if the corruption has already progressed in the intestine, and an opening has been made through to its cavity.
You know that that which is from the great intestine is easier of healing: and that which is from the small intestine is more difficult of healing.
But the intestine which is called the jejunum, does not recover from a wound which has happened to it throughout: and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and the magnitude of them, and because of the fineness of its body, and nearness to its own nature of nerves
If however the wound proceeds from the spleen, and follows this, then reduce it according to your reduction which you make of the intestines equally
If however it has passed beyond that space, and has become black, or dark: then it is necessary that you tie it up with a thread above the place which has been denigrated by it, so that the blood does not flow. For in the spleen are veins and arteries.
Then cut through that which is beyond that ligament, and place two hanging threads from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so as to support above its attraction, and extraction of it from the case of the spleen, and the emission of the pus of the wound.
Remember the wound which has happened in the Intestine.
When a disruption happens in the Intestine, and it is small: then it is possible, that it may be healed in some people: because I saw that which was wounded in the middle of his stomach with the lance, and was ancient: and the wound was made into a fistula, and came out of it through egestion, and there was swelling
I appoint the treatment until such time as I am not occupied with his/her cure: neither shall I cease to subtilize him/her until he/she is cured and his/her place is consolidated.
When I have completed my task and consolidated my place, I fear over the patient lest something should happen to him through the action of some evil thing in his body: and nothing should happen to him from that evil thing.</start_of_turn> And I remain in better arrangements, eating and drinking, and hoping, and I have bathed, and I have exercised myself in my diet.</start_of_turn>
And some of the experimenters say that when a wound occurs in the intestine and is small: then it is necessary to bind it in this manner.</start_of_turn> And it is like taking large ants.</start_of_turn Then join together two lips of the wound, and put an ant on one of those which have an open bone over two lips of the wound.</start_of_turn When you have done this, and have bound up the bone, cut off its head, and it will adhere to it, and will not dissolve.</start_of_turn
Then put another ant near the first one, and do not cease doing this until you have done as much as the whole wound.</start_of_turn
Then reduce the wound and its pain.</start_of_turn These ants remain annexed to the intestine until the intestine is healed, and is not injured by any sharp thing.</start_of_turn
And it is possible to bind the intestine also with a fine thread: which has been taken from the intestine of an animal, and is annexed to it when it is introduced into the belly.</start_of_turn
And it is thus, that thou shalt receive the extremity of this son from the intestine, and it shall be excarned much. Then bind in the extremity of his limb a thin linen thread which is wrapped around it Then introduce that limb into the gut, and sew it together with it. Then reduce it to disruption.
And this manner of stitching with hooks and gut is not without risk, save according to the measure of trust and hope.
Thou knowest, a great and bulky wound, especially if it be in one of the fine intestines: then there is no wisdom save a slight cutting, and there is no healing of it altogether
About care for wounds and fistulas.
Thou knowest, that every wound, or abscess when it grows old and becomes hardened, and becomes a wound, and does not consolidate, and emits pus always, and does not burst: then it is called generally in every part of the body a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.</start_of_turn>
And a fistula is indeed according to truth a filtered nodulation, hard, white: with which there is no pain, which has the nature of the wing of a bird: and for that reason they call some of them Risati, that is, wings.</start_of_turn
And in some hours it is humid, which emits pus.</start_of_turn And perhaps it bursts in some hours.</start_of_turn And when it is this humid matter is much, and is little, and is large, and is soft.</start_of_turn
And I say before you, whenever I have mentioned an ulcer, that no ulcer whatsoever that does not heal by natural means, neither is it born in that flesh, is anything other than through one new cause.
And one of these is because of the scarcity of blood in the body: or because of the wickedness of the blood: or because between itself and over the lips there is tough flesh, hindering the birth of flesh: or because there is much pus and dirt: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the material that issues from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is inappropriate for its treatment: or because corruption is falling in the region, which is a kind of pestilence: or by the nature of the region itself, as it happens in Caesaraugusta, in which there is great difficulty in digesting food and the healing of wounds is delayed by nature: or because there is one bone, or many bones.
And I have stated all of these causes and signs and their treatments with the physicians in the discourse: and it is fitting for you to write the treatment of fistula and hernia, which is done by one operation with the hand.
You know therefore that fistula can occur in all the members of the body. For there are fistulas which extend to great veins and arteries, or nerves, or fat: or to the intestine, or the bladder, or to some of the ribs: or to some of the vertebrae, or to some composition of joints: such as the hand and foot. And there are those which arise from the proximity of the principal limb and the like
For such fistulas are according to this manner: they arise from difficult and non-healing ailments, and do not receive treatment, and the care for them is laborious and ignorant
If, however, any fistula does not reach these parts which I have mentioned, and if you hope for its recovery and trust in its treatment, and wish to attempt its healing, then attempt it from the air or from the iron, for the fistula tends in this way. Inquire about it with the physician herself.
If, however, in the Fistula there is tortuositas, then you must investigate it with a slight weight of lead. For the lead, on account of its slightness, will alleviate the harshness of its body and will curve around the tortuositas.
If the Fistula has many orificia, it is not possible to make a significant sign upon it with a slight weight Therefore clench from the opening of the orificia towards the other opening of the orificia.
For the humidity that you clench with will go forth from the other opening of the orificia and will run out from the body.
Then inquire precisely in what way it is possible for you: whether it is an os or a nerve, and whether the Fistula is long or short: or whether it is a single Fistula which has many orificia, and is stretched over all of it, with the sum of your strength: with your inquiry which you make to the patient, and the finding of pain in compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and symptoms of the accident.
When you have stood in all these positions truly, then you will come to the cure according to your confidence: and it is that you consider then, if the apparent Fistula is close to the juncture, or far from the juncture from a nerve, artery, vein, or any place which I have mentioned to you: then dry the Fistula according to what has been said before in this narration, and take away what is in it from filtration, and corrupted blood, which is born from the tissue in its opening, or the pus, and similar things: and care for it until it is healed
If, however, the Fistula is of great depth and is according to the rule: then it is necessary to cut away the part in depth as much as is possible Then loosen her from all corrupted flesh.
Then administer unguents bound up in acute medicines: and introduce them until they reach the depth of the fistula which you have comprehended with the iron: do this until the acute medicine has eaten away everything that remains in the depth of the fistula from corruption.
Then restore her with unguents which generate healthy flesh, until she is healed.
If she does not heal thereby, then burn her according to what we have narrated
If indeed the cause of the fistula is bone, and you suspect this: then inquire about it, and dry it up as I have told you: if you are not forbidden by anything from the bone, or nerve, or main limb, as we said
If indeed it is found that the bone is in some degree corrupted and black: then burn it until the corruption is entirely gone Then care for her with that which nourishes her, until she is healed.
For if she does not heal, and pus comes out like she used to: then you know that you have not reached the entire eradication of the corruption.
Therefore take care of this secondarily, and make an investigation of the cause of it, and loosen her with all your strength
Then restore her. If indeed she heals, that is good: and if not, then you know that the corruption is in a deep part of the body, which you have not followed. It is not enough for you in this matter, except you dismiss her like the nature of things.
If indeed the small bone is corrupted, and you think it possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps which fit to it
If there are many bones, then you must perform attraction on them all, and do not leave anything out with your skill.
If, however, there is some moisture in them [the bones], and there is no fear of incision, or of error: then you must cut through those moist parts and flesh, if there are any, and free the bones.
If you are not prepared to extract the bones at this hour, then put over them something which will cause putrefaction to it: and leave it until it has putrefied, that is until the soft parts surrounding the bones have rotted away from the bones and the moisture
And keep the cloth so that it does not harden. And be cautious as you make the incision in your operation. If you wish, put over it, if you will, some sulfur which has been ground with oil: or immerse it in Egyptian unguent, or in some other unguents of your choosing
For when these moist parts putrefy, and are separated from the bones, the swelling will subside, and the attraction of the bones will be restored
If, however, there is a large bone, such as the shin bone or the thigh bone, which are corrupted: then take away that part entirely, until the blackness and corruption have vanished And then restore the cloth.
If, however, that which is corrupted is a large part, and the corruption has extended to the marrow of the bone: then it is necessary to cut through it completely, and to cut away all that is corrupted: then care for it until it has healed
And I tell you, what happened to me in my leg: that you may take it as an example and an assistant for your operation.
A youth of about thirty years of age suffered pain in his leg, because something had become loose within his body, that is, from within, until it reached the thigh, and there was discharge of great quantity: there was no external cause.
It has been prolonged thus long as with the mistake of the physicians, until the abscess opened, and many materials came out together with it.</start_of_turn> And after that, his recovery took place, until the thigh was ligated, and many holes were made in it: from which all sorts of pus and moisture were emitted, and the body was moistened.</start_of_turn>
He was treated by many physicians for two years, and no art of hand was found in this matter until I saw him, and I saw that his thigh was black, and that various matters were flowing from his holes in great quantity: even all the hair of his body was falling out, and his complexion was yellow.</start_of_turn>
There was an attempt to reach the cavity of one of his wounds, and the attempt reached the bone.</start_of_turn
Then I examined all his holes: and I found that they were all communicating with each other throughout the thigh.</start_of_turn
I treated him accordingly, and I cauterized over one of those holes, until I reached a part of the bone: and I found that it was corrupted: it was corroded, discoloured, rotten, and perforated, until it had penetrated as far as the marrow.</start_of_turn
I extracted what was detected from the bone, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.</start_of_turn
And I concluded that there was no other blemish in the bone except that corruption, which I excised and cauterized.</start_of_turn> I have eradicated it.
Then I order restoration of the wound with consolidated spaces for a long time with the physicians. It is not consolidated yet.
Then I tried, and found upon the second examination: and I observed continuous corruption with the bone: and I saw that there appeared to me also from that corruption
I am making an attempt to restore it It is not restored yet
I found therefore again on it, and I did not cease to cut the bone piecemeal, and I attempted to restore it: and it is not restored, until I cut from the bone round about the palm of the hand, and I extracted that with the marrow
Then I restored it with the physicians, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and no further operation was necessary concerning this matter, except for the disposition of the weakness of the patient, and his little tolerance, and my fear of death for him: because it was happening to him at all hours from the excess of vomiting of bad evacuations.
He is now healed completely: and was made in the place of the broken bone, and a good disposition was made of the body: and its strength returned: and it rested in its dispositions: and did not cause him any hindrance in walking or any other movement from that time forward
If, however, the prominent bone in the body which I have just fractured is: then it is necessary to support it thus: take hold of the ligament and bind the bone at its extremity: and command someone to extend it upwards: and put another ligament from a thicker thread than the first ligament.</start_of_turn> Then bind the ligament over the flesh which is upon the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you draw the meat downwards: and you will find the meat over the place where you wish to cut, so that it does not damage the meat.</start_of_turn>
Place wood or a board under the lower bone in the center: for when you do this, it will not hinder that the saw will freely cut the corrupted flesh.
The incision should be made close to the corrupted area, but not on the concave side of the bone, for it should not be visible to the eye and must not impede the cutting of the saw
If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, it must be continued with the rest of the limb: and the corruption is in the middle or at the end: then remove the flesh from all sides of the whole limb Then place wood below.
Saw from the first part where the corruption is, until the incision continues to the other side: and let the incision be as far from the corruption as possible, as we have said before.
If the corruption is at the joint, saw through the corrupted joint, and saw the bone where the incision continues on the other side.
If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in that place except by abrasion.
If the corruption is in the palm of the hand or in the heel: then things are difficult there However you must inquire about the nature of the corruption. And scrape it away as much as you can in any way that seems good to you, and with any ingenuity that will not harm the vein or nerve
You must know that there are many saws and cutting instruments for bones of various sizes, preparations, thicknesses, lengths, degrees of brittleness, and rarities Wherever necessary, one must prepare an instrument suitable for each kind of operation.
You know well that these operations are significant above the kind of instrument which is inappropriate for them, when one has long studied them And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony of the methods of treatment: for then you will find for every disease that which thing is suitable from instruments concerning all diseases
I am firm in the last of this chapter concerning the number of instruments, which I have placed as examples for which you inquire, and the test which you will experience on others.
The Shape of the other Scalpel
The Shape of the Scissors for Sutures Its head is like the head of a star-shaped key: and its points are like the points of the needles for embroidery
And it does not fit, except when it is grasped with the head of the sutures, when they are broken, or when the bone is wide, and great
The Shape of the Larger Scissors
The Shape of the Small Scissors
The Shape of the Scissors which has a concavity
The form of the rasping of another is subtle.
The form of the rasping of another is acute at the extremities
The form of the rasping is slight, subtle in its grasp.
This is like the rasp of a saw, and the extremity is like a saw: it appears in many places because of the cause of the bones.
The form of the rasping is that which coincides with the cause of its perforation by bones
Its extremity is triangular, and the extremity is acute.</start_of_turn>
Like that of India And it is like this with regard to the rasping, the cutting, and the sawing.</start_of_turn>
As for the incision of the extremities, and the suture of the bones.</start_of_turn>
The extremities putrefy, either by an external cause, or an internal cause.</start_of_turn
When therefore you have treated the disease with medicines, and it has not cured: and if you do not cut away the corruption of the limb without causing any further damage: then you must cut away that limb until the corruption has ceased, in order that the patient may be saved from death or from the greater defect of the limb.</start_of_turn
And the sign of this is that the limb is blackened, until it is consumed by fire: or putrefies after blackening: until that putrefaction has ceased from that limb, and has spread throughout the body.</start_of_turn
Properly therefore with the incision itself, and likewise if the cause of the corruption is from a percussion of some venomous creatures: such as a scorpion of the sea, and vipers, and spiders, and the like.
If therefore the corruption, or the percussion, is at the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and not leave space for the corruption, so that it may reach right up to the remainder of the hand.
And likewise if it happens in the palm, then cut off the palm from the root of the bone, and not leave space for the corruption, until it has seized in the bone of the forearm
And if it comes to this, then cut off the forearm at the elbow in its joint
But if the corruption has passed and you see it around the elbow: then in this is the death of the patient. And to manage beyond this from treatment, is the quantity of the poison.
And likewise do the same with the foot, when the corruption comes to the finger, then cut off the finger at one of the nodes: and if it has seized in the heel, then cut off the whole foot And if it reaches the knee, then cut off the thigh at the knee joint
If the corruption has already passed beyond the knee, then there is no remedy in this, except dismissal, and to leave the patient to die.
And the manner of cutting off a limb, or preserving it, is that you bind the ligament below, which you wish to cut: and bind the ligament above in the place. And extend one ligament downwards: and extend the other ligament upwards. And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a sharp knife, until the whole flesh is detached Then it occurs, or it returns.
Then it occurs, or it returns. And it is necessary that you place oil from all parts of the sponge around the wound, and do not touch the healthy tissue: and it will arrive that the patient's condition will worsen with the added injury, and the swelling will grow cold.
If, however, there is an internal flow of blood during the operation, then cauterize the place quickly: or put above it some powder that will absorb the blood.</start_of_turn> Then return to your medication until completion.</start_of_turn>
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and care for it, until it heals.</start_of_turn
And I tell you what happened to me in my foot, namely that this is what happened to me.</start_of_turn
That is, because in my foot there was a black spot, which was caused by an inflammation that resembled a fire: and the corruption began in my finger, until it reached the whole foot.</start_of_turn
Therefore I extracted the man from his ailment, after I had cut out the corruption from the limb with the help of an instrument, because of the pain, and the inflammation: and it healed at the junction, and was healed.</start_of_turn
And when a long time had passed, the same corruption happened to him in the thumb of his hand.</start_of_turn
He came to me, and I attempted to cure it with what I found among the physicians after the restoration of his body: but the superfluity did not disappear, and it began to spread to another finger: until the corruption reached the hand itself.</start_of_turn
He called me to amputate his hand: and I did not do that, hoping for the disappearance of that superfluity: and I was also afraid of the death of his hand at the incision.</start_of_turn Wherever there was a wound on a man, it was above the case.
When he had fainted from me, he was brought back to the earth: and he came to me because he was eager, and he put his hand entirely into my wound: and he was healed.</start_of_turn>
And I do not believe this narration, except as an aid concerning that which falls from the kind of this disease: and as a signification of what is signified, and according to how it is done.</start_of_turn
About the care of bones, and the quality of blistering with physicians.</start_of_turn>
When something breaks in some limb by a cut, and the space of the break is prolonged until collection of pus forms: then it is burst, or pierced, and what is in it is ejected, and what remains in it is like a wound: and the skin which is above it is like a thin membrane which has been stripped off: and it does not go to the end in its corruption, neither does it reach the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it is called a Sinus and not a Fistula, truly, but if its space is prolonged until corruption is impressed in some of the parts of the limb, then it is called a Fistula, or swelling.</start_of_turn
And its care is to cut the whole skin as it is rolled back: and especially when it is stripped off, and made like a membrane: and trust that it does not stick to the place because of its corruption.</start_of_turn
If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere and not leave a lasting result of its corruption: and if there is hardness in the skin from the flesh, then care for it with blistering: and consider it as a Sinus.</start_of_turn
If it is great, and the pus which comes out of it is foetid of odor: then clench it with aegyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and zinc, equal parts being gathered in a vessel: and they are boiled over fire until the medicine turns red. And it comes to a state of thickness like honey.
Then take from it what is needed: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clench it with vinegar: and string its orifice, and give the medicine to it in the quantity of two hours
Then draw it out with pressure: do this for several days, until the sinus is healed and the stench is gone.
And when it is clenchized with vinegar and water, when it is not present this medicine: then take ashes of wood or the ashes of ilic tree: and sprinkle them over water. Then let the patient drink, and clench it with these things until you are confident that the sinus is broken
If the patient is not tolerant of the aegyptian medicine, neither of vinegar and water, then clench it with water and honey, to which something of ground zinc has been added Or clench it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey to heal and cleanse: and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is excess of astringency and dryness in it.
When you have done this often, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has passed away: then clench it with that which makes meat appear in it.
And it is fitting to take from gypsum plaster of Daphne: and dissolve it with rose oil and wine vinegar: or clench it with some medicine, and smear over it other unguents, whose properties are written in the treatise on unguents.
If the opening of the sinus is narrow, so that a cannula of the clister cannot enter: then widen it with a small iron; or place within it a piece of lint soaked in Egyptian unguent, or in basilicon unguent, until it is widened.
And in like manner if it is a large opening, then gather its lips together with sutures; and let go from it the quantity which enters the clister without adding more.
And in like manner if pus runs from the opening, let it be raised upwards: then dry it in the lower part which is in it, so that it runs downwards: for pus, when it is congealed in the depth of the sinus, hinders the generation of flesh in it.
If it is not possible to dry the sinus round about downwards, then try to prepare the limb with the preparation which runs out of it with ease as is prepared. Try that no pus remain in it at all: and take solidifying medicines which are placed over the sign, suitable for this purpose And extend them over the edge of the cloth. And let the cloth be of such a quantity as to cover the whole sinus Then enter with forceps directly at the opening of the sinus, widening the opening of the sinus slightly. Then spread out from the soft tissues on the other side of the cloth, according to the size of the opening: and place it over it in a long position away from the opening of the sinus, so as to alleviate the discharge of pus from it: and do not put too much cloth, except after a few days once it has become one
He who is above the opening of the sinus must move in every hour, so that it may go out what is gathered in it from the pus: and know whether that which runs out of it is much or little, or digested or undigested.
And thus consider again the position of the sinus itself, whether the master of the limb feels pain there, or whether there is no pain there, and whether there is swelling there, or whether there is no swelling there.
When you thus advance your treatment in this way, and wash away the matter which comes out of the opening of the sinus, then you will know whether the sinus is adhered, or approaches adherence: then you must remove it in its entirety, or within three days: and when you have removed the ulcer, then change the dressing, and renew the ointment.
If, however, something exits from the sinus after a long space of time with a subtle flow, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing approaches, because there are people from whom meat is tardily generated in their ulcers, and there are those who act contrariwise to this.
If, however, something exits from the sinus after many days with undigested pus, then you know that the sinus is not adhered
If thus the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its condition is prolonged: then add in the execution of your treatment, truly let the physicians do what they must, that there be moisture in their medications and dryness in their application: like aloe, when added in excess gives an additional moisture.
And from the last of all, when you have cured it, take aloe and dissolve it with rosewater, and apply it over the old wound in its substance.
Then bind it up with it, and use it.
And thus it is done like this action when there is no aloe available, honey, when you boil it, until it is softened, and use it with it.</start_of_turn> Or take myrrh, and aloe, and olibanum: grind them all together, and mix them with honey while it is over the fire.</start_of_turn> Then draw a line above the middle of the wound, and string the wound over the Sine: and draw the line with honey which you have boiled, until it is absorbed: and powder over the wound of the same kind, and place upon it the dressing, and string it.
And when it is administered in that ointment of long aristolochia, and roots of heavenly lily, and is lily: and barley of herb, and centaurea. Use either simple or compound unguents, and sponges themselves: and powder over the honey which I have mentioned, and use that.
If it be prolonged the sinus and does not heal by this treatment: then you know that there is corruption in its depth: or that it makes an impression in the bones, or in the other hard parts, or ligaments: then treat the fistula according to what has been said before
Of the treatment of panaritis and nails drawn out, and incision of the added digit, and section.
Panaritis is a swelling which arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it arises in the other fingers.
When it is prolonged and neglected, it becomes inflamed and produces pus: until it has rotted the root of the nail: and perhaps it has rotted the whole, and perhaps the corruption has extended to the bone, whereupon there is a foul odor: and the nail becomes broad and the color of it becomes dark
When you have treated it as we have said above, and the cure has not taken hold: then it is necessary to cut away with the knife the whole remaining part of the nail Then cauterize the wound afterwards. The cautery is very useful indeed.
If indeed the bone is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the excess of nails impinges on the meat inwards, and they begin to pierce the very flesh, and cause pain: then it is necessary that you place a small radium under the nail which is piercing the flesh, and push upwards: and cut away the flesh with ease, and place over that which remains of the flesh from the burning and corroding doctors, until it is all removed. Then care for it with the nails, until it is healed.
If however corruption has occurred in the bone, then it is necessary that you cut away that bone and extract it: for it will never heal as long as it remains corrupted in that bone
And if you see the corrosion and corruption advancing in the finger, then cut it at one of its nodes, as has been previously mentioned concerning its reminder Then care for it, until it is healed
If however the nail should become brittle or broken: and if there is pain in that, then it is necessary that you draw out the diseased part at first Then dry the nail with sharp Spatumili from above downwards to the end.
And take care, lest the incision should reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will thereby cause the addition of pain to the already existing pain, and will be the cause of the decay of the flesh in that place.
Then care for the place with that which sits on the pain.
The finger which has been added which is born in the hands of men, perhaps is all flesh: perhaps in some of them there are bones, and perhaps in some of them there is a nail: and some of them are born in the root of the joint, or is the nature of it in some node of the finger He who is born in the middle of a fingernail does not move: and he who is born at the junction of the fingernail may perhaps move.
He who is born of flesh is fleshy, and his section is easy.</start_of_turn> As for that which is at the root with a broad spatula.</start_of_turn>
But as for that whose birth is at the junction, its cure is difficult.</start_of_turn Abstain therefore from its incision.</start_of_turn
But as for that which is born in the finger at the end of the nails, then it is necessary that you cut through the flesh first with a round incision up to the bone.</start_of_turn And then draw out the bone with one of the accompanying chisels.</start_of_turn And then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn
Consolidation however which happens to the fingers downwards happens often either by the nature of man, that is, it is born with it, or by the consolidation of a wound, or by the burning of fire, and the like.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary therefore to dissect away this consolidation until the fingers regain their natural shape.</start_of_turn Then put between them nails, or soaked bands in warm oil: so that they do not consolidate too quickly, and separate them: or put between them a thin sheet of lead, until the place has consolidated as it should.</start_of_turn
And in like manner if there be consolidation of some finger with the palm, then dissect away that consolidation according to what is prepared and convenient for the figure of the limb.</start_of_turn
On the Incision of Varices.
The veins involved are swollen, large, and filled with melancholy humors which occur in various parts of the body: and most frequently in the thighs, especially in the thighs of laborers and those who are on the move, and in the limbs which bear weight
It is therefore necessary to administer an excision of the body with black bile somewhat mixed with strong evacuation
Then let there be a bloodletting of the patient with ease of basil.
The cure for these therefore is with iron, in two ways One of them is to cut them open, and draw out the black blood. The other is to elevate the vein, and draw out all of it
The incision itself is done in this way. The thigh is grasped in the first place with warm water, until the thick blood has dissolved Then the limb of the patient is bound from the upper part of the hip down to the lower part of the knee with the varicose vein between. Then the vein is cut through in one place, or two, or three wide sections
And extract the blood upwards from the lower part of the thigh to the upper part, and from the upper part let there be bloodletting of the patient at first Then dry the wound downwards until the amount of blood which has escaped is equal to that which is needed, and as the patient can tolerate the pain.
Then bind up the limb: and command him to abstain from foods which generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and this will be helpful to the patient
The elevation of that is done in this manner. If the limb is swollen with many hairs, elevate it above the level of the heart. Then introduce it into a bath: or embolize it in the limb with warm water, until it turns red, and expel the veins: or exercise a strong exercise, if there is no bath present, until the limb becomes warm
Then dry the skin along the section of the vein: or at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and remove the vein from all sides, until sensation returns: and it is at the return of sensation that the vein has turned from red to black When it has gone out of the skin, tie up the vein like a cord
Then introduce radium under it, until it rises up and comes out of the skin: suspend it with a piece of gauze, fine
Then dry the other section nearby by three fingers. Then remove the skin from the upper part of the vein, until sensation returns Then elevate the limb with the radium as you did before, and suspend it with another piece of gauze, as you did before
Then dry the other section, or several sections, if you wish Then elevate, and cut the last section near the heel
Then draw out the limb to the section which is above it
And do this until you have drawn out the limb from the superior section, or from all the higher sections, until when it comes out completely: then cut the limb
If, however, it does not obey you to extract it, and you must elevate it: then introduce an awl with a strong double wire, and bind it, and extract it. Or introduce it under that radium and withdraw your hand to every part until it emerges. Take heed, lest you should perforate it.</start_of_turn> For if it is perforated, it becomes difficult for you to elevate it afterwards, and it will enter through that wound again.</start_of_turn>
When you have finally extracted it: then place upon the place of the wound a soaked lanolin bandage dipped in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If the vein is contracted, having a twist which involves parts, and is not as we have described according to the rule: then you must find upon the vein over every part of the twist, and the place of the twist itself.</start_of_turn
Then suspend the vein with hooks, until you have extracted it completely: and take heed at the section of your vein over the vein lest you cut the vein, or wound it: for it is difficult to elevate or extract it.</start_of_turn Be prudent therefore.</start_of_turn
The form of the wound in which the vein heals.</start_of_turn
The form of the surrounding area of the wound.</start_of_turn
It is not like the other wounds, neither acute at the edges, as to wound the vein: but it is of a gross flexibility, gentle: for if it were slight, it would tear the vein by its flexibility: and if it were too great, as we have said.</start_of_turn
On the extraction of the vein of the thigh.
This vein is generated in the thighs in warm places, like Alizegi and Arabia, and in dry, warm places, where little vegetation grows, for in such places herbs and trees do not grow.</start_of_turn>
It may also be generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs.</start_of_turn
And its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, like that which happens within the bodies of snakes and worms, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.</start_of_turn
And the sign of the beginning of the event of this vein is inflammation in the thigh with swelling.</start_of_turn Then the place is to be dried.</start_of_turn Then the vein is to be extracted from the place of drying, as though it were the root of a plant or an animal.</start_of_turn
When it appears from that extremity, then it is necessary to cover over the lead with lead, which weighs from a drachma to two drachmas and a node: and let the lead hang down from the thigh.</start_of_turn
Every time something comes out from that, cover it with lead and a node.</start_of_turn If it is prolonged for a long time, then cut off a part of it and cover the rest.</start_of_turn And do not cut through the root before all of it has come out.</start_of_turn For if you cut through it, it contracts and enters the flesh: and causes swelling, putrefaction in the place, and bad ulcers.</start_of_turn
Wherever it is necessary, it must be gently drawn out gradually, until nothing remains in the body except the last bit, and from this nothing remains in the body: and from this vein it exits in some people as far as the length of five palms and ten fingers. And thus it is known to me, for the urine has exited from twenty palms.
If however it happens to you in the hour of your medicine: then insert the radium into the cavity of it, and perforate the cavity with a needle as long as the body, until all that is in it is evacuated: and administer the putrefaction of the place with the physicians for a few days. Then care for the aftercare of the wound.
And this vein often has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself: and it has many outlets, and exits from every orifice branch
Care for it therefore as we said before, and as is said above
About the incision above the worms generated under the skin, and it is called the bovine disease.
This disease is called in our land the bovine disease: because it often happens to cows, and is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it travels throughout the body, ascending and descending: and is perceived by the sense during its walking from limb to limb, until it ruptures wherever it ruptures the skin in the place and exits.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of some humors. Just as worms and serpents are produced, that is to say, roundworms and ascarides in the belly
And his malice departs from him. When he himself enters the body, and mounts to the head, and comes to a place: then perhaps he opens in that place, and departs, and destroys the eye: and that is what often happens.
When one wishes to cure him and extract him, then it is not done except during his walk and his sensation.
It is necessary therefore, that one should bind that which is above him and that which is under him with strong ligature Then dry over him, and extract him.
If he is deepened in the flesh, and you do not find him: then put over that place a cautery with fire, until he dies
And greater than that is the corruption of his malice, which corrupts the eye, as we have said
If however you see him going towards the head close to the eye: then bind under that the eyebrow with a good tightening Then dry over him, and extract him
And it is necessary that the sick man should be treated with the purification of his body, with physicians resolving the bad humors.
And beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
And about the section over the navel of Nakir.
This ailment is called in our land Nakir: and it is a pain that happens in some limbs: then it changes from limb to limb.
And I myself have seen it, as I have told you. I have been called to a sickly woman in some place. She has discovered her arm swollen, and fluid is gathered in the pit of the elbow bone.
After an hour had passed, there was an increase in swelling, like that of a worm, rising up to the shoulder, more quickly than it is possible for it to run: so that it became like a living silver, when it runs from place to place
The pain therefore vanished from that place, and it was fixed in the shoulder
Then after an hour it ran throughout the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then she reported to me that it returned throughout her whole body, as she had seen previously
I marvel at the speed of its change from limb to limb And I myself had never seen such an ailment with the eyes like this in the same way But I have heard many people speak of pain that changes from limb to limb: and I have never seen it with my eyes, as I have seen it in this woman
And I do not believe it is possible, except that it is because of the swelling of the veins of the limbs which are in this case detected from the inside outwards: from which it appears that the sensitivity of the limbs is altered
It is necessary that it does not appear in delicate people and in those who have moist bodies, because of the hidden veins.
When you see that the patient has sensation of pain: then if it appears to you like this which we have said, then bind over it above and below more quickly: and dry above it until the swelling is gone: and cauterize the place.
If you do not aid the eye itself with your eyes: then care for it with the excuse of the body, and with that which ejects wind from the intestines, and carminates it with foul pills and wormwood pills and the like.
If you do not aid the eye itself with your eyes: then care for it with the excuse of the body, and with that which ejects wind from the intestines, and carminates it with foul pills and wormwood pills and the like.
Sagittae are diversified according to their kinds and according to the place from which they fall from the body.
Their diversity is such: for some have large teeth and few, and some are concave and some are convex And there are those which have three angles And those which are tongues And those which are stars
The latter are those which are according to the parts from which they fall, is according to two modes. Or rather the parts are from concaved main parts, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and veins, and things like these When therefore it falls into some one of these members, and you perceive the signs of death, which I shall narrate to you afterwards, then it is necessary that you draw out that arrow from the body, for death follows its wound in various positions And when you do not perceive these bad signs, and the arrow is not hidden deeply in the member, then draw it out and care for the wound.
When the arrow has fallen into the brain and has pierced the bone, and has emerged upon the brain itself, it is because its impact has caused vomiting, excitement, buzzing, redness of the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and cholera. And perhaps blood will be discharged from the nose or ears.</start_of_turn> And perhaps speech will be lost, and consciousness will be destroyed.</start_of_turn> And white pus will issue from the wound like pulp.</start_of_turn> And it will be like the discharge of blood from a piece of meat.</start_of_turn>
If these signs appear, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not emerge.</start_of_turn
The signs of an arrow which has fallen into the cord are: that it is close to the left breast: and that it feels as though it is fixed in something hard, not in something soft.</start_of_turn> And perhaps the arrow is in motion like the pulse: and blood will flow from the wound black.</start_of_turn And following this will be cold extremities, cold sweat, and fainting.</start_of_turn You know therefore that death approaches with certainty.</start_of_turn>
The sign of an arrow which has pierced the lung is the discharge of bloody foam from the wound: and the breath which follows becomes hoarse, painful, and changes the colour of the sick person.</start_of_turn And the spirit will expire greatly, loudly: and will yearn for the cold air.</start_of_turn
If an arrow falls into the chest, which is near the flanks: then it is close to the great back: and it makes a great sigh with pain and aspiration, with breathing: and it moves all the arms and shoulders.
If an arrow falls into the stomach: then perhaps it comes out through a wound from undigested food
If an arrow falls into the abdomen and lies there: something of stool or a bladder or intestine which has been ruptured will come out through the wound. There is no hope for its cure, neither in the extraction of the arrow.
If an arrow falls into the bladder and comes out with urine: and something proceeds from it to the outside: and there is a greater pain over the diseased part: then you know that it is mortal
The rest of the members, like the face, the neck, the chest, the abdomen, the shoulder, the arm, the wrist, the hand, the buttocks, the thigh, the leg, and the foot are similar in their condition: when it does not find the arrow in an artery or nerve: and there is no venomous arrow.
And I tell you that I have seen many of these arrows: so that you may know concerning their treatment.
That is because I take care of myself, that an arrow has fallen into the tear of my eye, in the root of my nose. I extracted it from the other side, under the earwax of his ear: and he was healed, and it did not leave him a mark in his eye
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was hidden, and I did not find its tip except for the mark left by it in its wood: and it was a great arrow, like those of the Turkish archers, with lead in it, in which there are no ears
The Jew is healed, and no evil has befallen his eye.
And I have drawn out another arrow from the belly of a Christian.
And there was an Arab arrow, which is the one with ears. Behind it [the arrow] above it between two ribs: and it was submerged in his belly I am careful with it until I have drawn it out: and the Christian is healed
And I drew out another arrow which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that it would die from it.
Afterward, when thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his condition concerning the arrow: I drew out the arrow: and he was healed, and no evil happened to him.
And I saw a man whose arrow had fallen in his back, and a swelling had formed over the wound. After seven years, the arrow was extracted from the root of his thigh
And I saw a woman whose arrow had fallen in her belly, and a swelling had formed over the wound: the arrow remained within her, and no change occurred in her condition from her natural operations.
And I saw another man whose arrow had fallen on his face: and a swelling formed, and the arrow remained, causing him little pain: similar things happened in many cases
And I drew out an arrow from the middle of the King's nose, which had fallen there, and it had declined to the right side: and the arrow was completely hidden
I was called to treat him after the arrow until three days had passed. I found the arrow stuck tightly in the flesh.
I found the arrow stuck tightly in the flesh, with the point unseen and not feeling it: and I myself found the point and the pain beneath its head on the right side. I think that was the cause of the wound from the extremity of the arrow
I applied plaster to the place where the wound was made by the attractive and digestible material, confident that the wound would heal and the sign of the arrow would disappear: and it did not happen in the place where the wound had occurred that the arrow had followed the place
I kept it plastered for many days: and it did not happen that anything happened, and the wound became consolidated in the meantime: and it remained immobile with regard to the extraction of the arrow until it felt the arrow one day within its nose And he told me this story.
And he told me this story. I put on the wound a sharp medicine, corrosive for many days, until it opened: and when I grasped it with my hand and felt the tip of the arrow under the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound the sharp medicine once more, until we saw the tip of the arrow clearly: and it passed from us through that space of time about four months.
Then when the wound had healed, and it was possible for us to introduce forceps into it, and to remove it, and it did not obey our order to come out: then I did not desist from my vigilance, and I devised superimposition over it with the methods of the learned men, until I was able to cover it on one day with forceps that I had made in the end, following the way they would form at the head, until I extracted the arrow. Then I restored the vein.
And the physicians say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored. I restored it therefore itself, and the vein was consolidated, and the illness was healed with complete health: nothing was left of it
And I tell you what is the quality of the extraction of some arrows: so that you may know the rule and the signification of that which I have not said
For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with the narration: neither does this book comprehend them, nor does a prudent artificer compare them with many, but rather with few; and with that which is present, rather than that which is absent: and he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descent of things extraneous to this art when they arise.
I say therefore, that arrows do not go out of the members from which they are fixed, except by two ways. Except by attraction from the place from which they entered. Or by turning the other way around
And whatever comes out from where it entered, that is an arrow proceeding in the flesh: it is attracted and comes out.
If it does not obey the exit at the time when it fell: then it is necessary that you draw it out a few days, until the flesh surrounding it has putrefied: and the attraction of it and its going out will be alleviated
And in the same way if it is embedded in a bone, and does not obey you at the exit, then draw it out also a few days: and do it again every day with the attraction and the movement, until it comes out
If it does not obey you at the exit after days, then it is necessary that you perforate all around the arrow in the bone from all sides with a fine awl, until the arrow is loosened Then draw out the [foreign object], and extract it.
If however the arrow has gone away from the body, and is hidden and covered from the sense: then inquire about it with the hand. If however you feel it, then draw out the arrow with some instruments which are suitable for its drawing out.
If however you are not able above the arrow, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in depth: and there is no bone, neither nerve, neither vein: then find above the arrow, until the wound be enlarged, and it is possible to draw out the arrow.
And if there are to it ears which hold the flesh fixed in the bone from all parts, from all ingenuity which you can think: and you conceive to draw it out above them, if you cannot draw out the flesh from the fracture of the ears, and the twisting of the ears, until it becomes soft
And you, when you administer the extraction of the Sagitta [arrow], in whatever place it is, then use a twist of your hand with the forceps to the whole parts, until you make it escape: and under the last subtle tension, that the Sagitta does not break, and that it becomes difficult for you to draw it out.
If you are unable to complete the extraction in one hour, then defer it for a few days, until the surrounding tissues have decayed. Then repeat it: if indeed the flux of blood opposes you, then administer what we have said in the chapter concerning the cure: and preserve your virtue from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or cord.
And administer with every means whatever is possible for the evacuation of the Sagitta: and let that be with ease, and tranquility, or slowly, and steadily, as I have told you
And it is necessary that you should do as you draw out the Sagitta, that the patient be according to the figure, according to how it was with the Sagitta in itself For there is nothing more harmful. If indeed that is not possible, then administer what is possible from the figure.
The Sagitta which comes out from the opposite part, or which proceeds from something to the exterior: or it makes a swelling at the extremity of the Sagitta by means of the sense from the superior part of the skin adjacent to it, and it brings about an escape: dry therefore above it, and make the incision according to the quantity that they can grasp in their forceps
Then draw out the arrow: for itself becomes easy to extract
If indeed it remains in the bone, then twist your hand according to the circumference, until you impress the Sagitta in the bone, and increase it: then draw it out.
If not: depart for a few days: then return again, until he departs.
If the arrow of Sagitta is in it, then pull it out with that itself.</start_of_turn>
If, however, the arrow has broken, and you wish to give an impulse: then introduce into the instrument a concave tool, so that the concavity of the tool may be included in the head of the arrow: then pull out the arrow with that itself.</start_of_turn>
If the arrow is concave, then pull out the arrow with the instrument entering it.</start_of_turn The arrow will be freed by that.</start_of_turn
If the arrow is poisonous, then it is necessary to remove the entire flesh in which the poison is, if possible.</start_of_turn Then care for the wound with that which is suitable for it.</start_of_turn
If the arrow is falling in the chest, or in the belly, or in the flank, or on the side: and it is close to that which you touch with your finger, and it is possible for you to dry above the wound: then dry, and burn from the edge of the wound, the vein or the nerve, and extract the arrow.</start_of_turn
Then wash the wound, if necessary, and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn
This is the form of forceps by which arrows are extracted.</start_of_turn
There are two similar extremities like the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not slip from it.</start_of_turn
And there are many kinds of forceps, large, small, medium, according to the quantity of the arrow, and the thinness or thickness of the wound, and the constriction of the wound.</start_of_turn
The form of an implanted concavity.
The form of an implanted prominence.
This is the shape of the extremities like radii, so that its entrance into the concave arch is facilitated, and is propelled by it
Of the phlebotomy of veins.
The veins which are to be phlebotomized, which abound in the body, are thirty in number.
Of these there are six in the head: two pulse veins which are behind the ears, called the Herbae: and two arteries which appear in two temporal regions: and two veins which are in the two tear-ducts of the two eyes, which are called the Aspicientes: and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead: and a vein which is at the extremity of the nose And two Guidegi which are in the neck And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth And two veins which are in the lower lip And these are the veins which are called the Algecherich And two veins which are under the tongue
The veins which are phlebotomized in the arms, are five in every arm
One of them is the Cephalica, and is from the side of the shoulder: and it is called the vein of the head And sponges. And sponges. And sponges. And sponges. And sponges
And sponges
And sponges And sponges And sponges And sponges
And sponges
And sponges. After the Golden Age, two veins are bled from.
And sponges. For these two veins which are bled after the Golden Age, their juice is useful for ancient cataracts, and for migraine, and for haemorrhoids, and for a bad headache of the capitis.
And the quality of the bleeding of these two veins is according to what is said above. And it is, that the head of the sick person is to be placed on a cushion: and the skin of his head is to be abraded in the place of the two veins with rough cloth. Then the patient shall be bound about the neck with a cord, until two veins appear. And their places are behind the Golden Age in two depressed places of the head Inquire therefore where your finger is touching, and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, there is a sign of the scar.
Then take the lancet of the phlebotomist and that is called Incidens. Then insert it under the nail into the palm, until the phlebotomist reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the nail and palm towards the upper parts, and cut the nail with the incision that is made in the middle And let the length of the incision be that of two joined fingers, or about that: and let blood flow out as much as you wish.
Then bind the blood vessel with ligatures, and let the blood vessel go, until it is healed
And thus it is necessary at the beginning of the book to speak of the incisions and their cauterization
There are two arteries in the hand which are to be opened in two times of phlebotomy: the ancient haematoma, the immediate bruise, the persistent haematoma, and the excessive flow of acute blood towards the eyes
And as for the quality of the bleeding which is to be known to you in this book Let the sickly person grasp his neck greatly, until two nails appear to be sensible in their appearance: and let the pulse of them be shown under your finger Then signs are made with the cautery.
Then raise the skin above the nail with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy there under the skin, and raise the nail upwards And cut the blood vessel, just as you did in the two preceding fingers: and let blood flow out according to the quantity that you need
Then solve the coarseness of the patient, and place your finger upon the hour mark for one hour. Then place your finger upon the butt and the calves, and tighten it above the constriction strongly: and release it when it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And thus it is necessary to remember the incision and the extraction of the parts at the beginning of the book.</start_of_turn>
The advantage of phlebotomy of the front vein after cephalic phlebotomy is for the ancient ailments of the face: and for migraine, and redness: and bedsores.</start_of_turn>
And the quality of this phlebotomy is as I have mentioned to you.</start_of_turn The patient tightens his neck with his hand, until the vein appears.</start_of_turn Then take the instrument called Fossorium.</start_of_turn
Place the prominent point at the head of the Fossorium on the vein, and pierce it with the hook or with something else in the same way: and let the blood flow according to the quantity you wish.</start_of_turn Then solve the perforation of the patient, and tighten it, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And when it is opened with the wide phlebotomy.</start_of_turn It is not right that the acute extremity should be phlebotomized, like the rest of the phlebotomies, but rather the wide extremity.</start_of_turn And the phlebotomy is done according to the passage of the blood: because the bone is close by: and perhaps in this it may break the phlebotomist when it is slight.
The application of two veins which are in the two tears of the two eyes is to the eye from the scab and redness: and behind the eye, and the pain in the face.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of them is that it tightens the sick man's neck with might Then the phlebotomy is easy: and you remain standing over his head.
And it is done according to the passage of the blood to a small length, with a small phlebotomist, broad, because there is no flesh in the place. If the phlebotomist is slight at the extremity, perhaps it will break.
Then let him run from the blood as much as you need. And put over his head the footstool, and bind up his neck once, and leave him for the night.
The veins of the nose are phlebotomized because of acute fever, and swelling of the gums, and pains in the face, such as a migraine, and redness that happens in the face: especially when it is old.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of them is that it tightens the sick man's neck. Then take his nose with your left hand, and make a small incision under the tip of the nose, long: and hold it in the middle of the nose, between that which distinguishes the nose according to its straightness Since the vulva does not appear to the sense there, and because blood immediately begins to flow.
It is necessary, therefore, to take hold of the hand lastly with the needle holder and to make blood flow freely according to your need. Then bind it once at night. The wound itself will soon restore itself.
But Guidegi speaks of phlebotomy in two cases: for constriction of the spirit, for the in-ception of leprosy, for melancholy, for itching and ulcers, and for corrosiveness, that is, for wounds caused by herpetiform eruptions
And the quality of phlebotomy in these cases is that it should tighten the sickly person under both arms in his neck with a ligature: and let the artist stand over the head of the sickly person, and the sickly person should sit upon a seat.
Then make the vein bleed to the length of the wide phlebotomy. Then draw out from the blood a quantity as warm, or as much as you need for this purpose Then do the same with the other vein
Then loosen the ligature, and tighten two veins with medium tension: so as not to injure the sickly person. And keep him until morning. The wound will then heal
Of the cutting of the veins Algeberich speaks The veins, however, Algeberich speaks of phlebotomy in these cases: because it relieves the hiccup in the throat, and corruption of the gums: and bad ulcers: and wounds of the lips, and bad ulcers, also those which are in the nose, and in the circumference of the eye
And what is the quality of the phlebotomy of these, that you make the sick man sit before thee: and tighten his neck with a cloth. Then draw out the lip of him, and look to his two veins: one of which is at the right side of the lip, and the other at the left side of it: and the sign of both is by the blackening of both. And truly it is: because around their circumference are small veins, black. Incise therefore each one with an incision that is appropriate to it.
If however doubt exists for you, and you do not know which of them it is: then you must resort to the incision of the greater of them, and their sign.
And thus do the same with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and most frequently it runs in custom with this: and incision the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Of phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after the cephalic phlebotomy. For indeed the veins which are under the tongue phlebotomize: that is to say, the cephalic phlebotomy is for the affections which are in the gut, and the swelling of the tongue, and the pains of the mouth
And the quality of the phlebotomy of the mandible is this, that you make the sick man sit between your hands towards the sun: and elevate his tongue, and look under the tongue at the side of him one vein, and at the side of him the other: and the color of both approaches to blackness.
Phlebotomy therefore each one: and hold, do not put your last hand in the phlebotomy of him. For under them are arteries, and perhaps there will flow blood from these arteries.
Three veins are found in the cubit that are commonly bled during phlebotomy in all humans.
Phlebotomy of these veins is performed in two ways. The puncture is either with a broad lancet: or with an olive oil-soaked swab: or with a knife, which is Alnesil. This is its form
There are both broad and fine species according to the width of the veins and the tension of their form. The manner of phlebotomy with the lancet is broad like blood It is suitable for opening wide veins, full of blood, protruding, apparent, large, and those containing thick blood
This phlebotomy is of smaller width and finer extremity
It is suitable for bleeding small, delicate veins containing thin, yellow blood
The basilica is one of the three veins commonly bled during phlebotomy Because it draws blood from the ailments that are under the gut and the throat, from that which follows the chest, and the hand: and it is suitable for the phlebotomist with the needle, as it causes no great fear, and is above all the artery If therefore it is mistaken, and the phlebotomist is too deep in the puncture of the phlebotomy, the artery will be injured, and there will be a flow of blood. Wherever necessary, do not use the phlebotome with a sharp point: rather let it be dry as with Alnesil.
If the swelling does not appear to recede by itself, then it is necessary to drain it away; or to substitute for it another, or to search for some branch of it. Or to make use of the phlebotome in its place at the elbow of the arm.</start_of_turn> The swelling is itself a manifestation; therefore let it be dry with the phlebotome as with Alnesil, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
If you must use the phlebotome for its own purpose, then do so before tightening the bandage, so that you may mark the place, until you know the place of the pulse.</start_of_turn Then mark over the place with grease, afterwards the arm, and dry the area with the concave section of the phlebotome as with Alnesil, as we have said.</start_of_turn Take care that the puncture does not break through to the artery.</start_of_turn>
And when you have finished, when you bind up the ligature, the swelling in the place which you marked with grease, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: you must therefore bind it up.</start_of_turn
If you see blood dripping from the phlebotome like urine from a boy, and it is thin, red: then you know that it is from the artery.</start_of_turn Then do so quickly, and put your finger over the wide space, then remove your finger.</start_of_turn If blood is therefore shed (for it is shed very often), then tighten the arm and let it go: and take care that the patient be at rest: and be over his fear.</start_of_turn
Neither does it eat for a few days until it is healed.
Unless the blood is stopped, and the pain persists: if there is no physician present at that moment, then cut the artery if necessary.</start_of_turn> For its extremities recoil from it, and the blood is stopped.</start_of_turn>
Or take the bark of the beech tree, and find it: take half an inch, and bind it over the place of the tight swelling, with ligature and threads until the next day.</start_of_turn>
Then if the blood is stopped, that is good.</start_of_turn And if not: then care for it as before, remembering from the place of the scattered fragments the flow of blood: and the cutting of the blood in these matters is not difficult on account of the small size of the wound, and the possibility of the ligature from the arm.</start_of_turn
The veins of the wrist for phlebotomy are deemed to be those which draw blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because they are composed of the basilica branch and the cephalic branch, as we have said.</start_of_turn
And it is convenient for the phlebotomist that there should be some fear of the phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve.</start_of_turn If therefore he adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds the nerve, there happens in that a stupor, and the healing of it is difficult, and perhaps it will not heal at all.</start_of_turn
And this nerve is very sensitive to sensation.</start_of_turn If, however, it is concealed in some people and is slight and does not manifest itself: then it is necessary that you perform a vein-cutting [procedure] as you would perform a phlebotomy, with a section according to Alnesil, and with a due degree of force.
If it is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
Of the cephalic vein. Phlebotomies of the cephalic vein are useful, because they draw blood from the head and confer it to the eyes
It is necessary in this vein alone, if you will, that you perform the phlebotomy with a needle like that of an olive-cutter, or with that of Myrtle: for it is safer for all the veins, because neither an artery nor a nerve is beneath them
But indeed it is fitting with the phlebotomy that you take hold of the head only as much as is necessary, and that you seek a softer place: and it does not harm if it is not found on the first percussion, as it will return with subsequent phlebotomies
Perhaps sometimes it will be delayed in some people when it is not performed on the first percussion, but it does not harm that in anything.
Of the usefulness of phlebotomy, and of the precautions to be observed in its performance. The quality of phlebotomy, and the accidents which may arise from it, demand that you reflect upon them
Firstly, know that phlebotomy is not to be used except in the preservation of health, and for the treatment of diseases, and for the prevention of ailments.
And that it should be performed in the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the cephalic, the basilic, and the cubital. And thus shall phlebotomy be performed at the beginning of spring upon the feast of Pentecost, in summer and autumn, and in winter after a meal, when signs of repletion appear.
And thus shall phlebotomy be performed on the first or third day, after three hours have passed
Phlebotomy, however, which is administered in fevers, has no fixed hour: but when convenience and necessity demand it, in the night or day, and at all hours, at all times.
And it is not proper to perform phlebotomy on children until they are over fourteen years of age. Neither is phlebotomy to be performed on a pregnant woman except from the fourth month until the seventh month. Neither is phlebotomy to be performed on the aged who are already past sixty years of age
When, however, anyone wishes to undergo phlebotomy for whatever reason, it is necessary to administer a cathartic prior to phlebotomy with a gentle enema, if there is much retained stool: that the intestines do not excrete foul matter onto the principal limbs during phlebotomy.
Neither shall phlebotomy be performed on a patient who is suffering from acute nausea, nor on a drunkard, nor on one suffering from a hangover, until these symptoms have passed from the body Neither on a patient with dropsy
And let phlebotomy be omitted after a fit of colic, vomiting, or flux of the bowels, and after exercise, sexual intercourse, and journeys, and overeating, and fasting, and all that dissolves virtue from the body or from the animal itself
Consider then the viscosity of the humors before this, if the blood is thick with food and drink, and the physicians: if it is possible for it.
Consider then the bath, if it does not forbid it: or some exercise is performed, to refine the blood.
And perform a phlebotomy of it in the chest, around the third of the day, as we have said: and strive that it be evacuated from the chest on that day from all accidental things harmful: such as distress, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily things, such as labor, and pain, and excess, and like things.
And let its scent be present with things that customarily accompany men from aromaticness, and fragrance, and delight and like things to that extent which is possible
Then sit the phlebotomist above the ankle, which is higher than the ankle of the phlebotomist: then draw out his arm, and wipe it with the phlebotomist's hand twice, or three times Then tighten the ligament with a bandage, and tie it twice.
And let the tightening be moderate, for when the tightening is unequal, or by excessive tightening, then it hinders the course of the blood: or in softening, then it hinders the course of the blood as well
Then after the tightening let him wipe the phlebotomized hand with his other hand until the veins are filled and the sense returns.
Then remove the phlebotomist from the phlebotomy with a little oil, as before.
Then put his index finger of his left hand on the same vein under the place where the phlebotomy was made, slightly: so that it does not flee, and that there be no percussion Because from veins is as it is from intestines like a running cord at a phlebotomy: and from flesh is that which is filled with air: and when you place a phlebotomy above this, it contracts under the phlebotomy, and tears the phlebotomist, and does not open the vein: and if it does open, it is strict. Because of this, it is necessary that the phlebotomist should be firm and attentive in all these matters.
Then withdraw the phlebotomy If indeed a vein opens from the vein one, then it is good. And if not, then repeat this vein a little lower or above with force: if the place does not yield
Which if it yields, or if the patient becomes faint, then let him go either today or tomorrow: and do not tighten the ligament. Perhaps the clot will be drawn out by the attraction. Neither put in a compress.
Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
If the opening is small, or blood runs slowly: and take care that it does not escape from the blood more than is necessary: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same place according to the rule, and add a little to the operation
Do it with force before the clot is formed: for the clot is in many people in the operation after the operation is finished
If indeed you see the clot coming out, then do not repeat over it at all, for this excuses you from the matter altogether. And put over it something of the fat of oil: because it will calm the running of the blood. It is better here than the oil itself and than any other oil.
Similarly, administer the face of the oil in every phlebotomy you make, except for those where you wish to impede the flow of blood: and they will make that which is above become dry and brittle.
Blood is refined and dissolved when it is thick.
If, however, this happens in the place of the phlebotomy after the great swelling, namely when it happens too often, especially when it is not a phlebotomy except for a slight opening of a small vein, then cleanse and put upon the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed up: and bind for an hour: because it will dissolve
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has gone out of the vein from the vein itself, with the addition of some of its own, or from another vein.
If anything black or yellow remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm: and if it does, put upon it some aloe or balm of cassia or something of the juice of mint, that is, calamine or something like that.
And many times swelling and swellings happen at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Put your hand upon it [the swelling] then, if you find softness under your compression of it, then that swelling is bad. Because of that, put upon it something of what we have said. For perhaps the blood will flow from that artery
But make a plaster of it with that which has a styptic action, so that the place is bound up Then care for yourself with the rest of the treatment, until you are healed.
It is also necessary to remove from every man from the blood according to the quantity of his virtue. And what appears from the burning color over the blood
For the blood is black, then let it go out: when it is red, let it go out: and in the same way if it is thick, let it go out: when it is thin, let it go out: and in the same way if it is sharp, let its sharpness be removed
And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and indigent of blood extraction to take one, in order to amplify the phlebotomy and make the phlebotomist wide: and in him who is weak, it is the contrary of him
And it is necessary to extract it in vessels, and that the hole be narrow: and it is better that it be administered in phlebotomy by a cut, not by a puncture
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of nerves: and it is more commendable and safer than phlebotomy by a wide area and depth.
And to whom it has happened to faint during phlebotomy, it is necessary that he should be given a spoonful of bread soaked in pomegranate juice before phlebotomy: or barley bread, if he is feverish: and extract from him from the blood in three or four vessels.
And if the complexion is pale, then he should take before phlebotomy bread soaked in honey or in scented honey syrup with spices, or in scented fragrant syrup.
If syncope occurs during phlebotomy, and the cause of it is excessive bleeding: then it is necessary to take in the pot water of meat, and fragrant syrup slightly thick: and flavor it with spices, and cool the chest with these things: and do the rest that we mentioned in the chapter on syncope from evacuation
Whoever wishes to empty out his arm and dissolve his blood in the second place must perform upon him a phlebotomy because of the great evacuation, and his nature is weak, so that he may gradually dissolve the blood in proportion to the amount of weakness in the days that follow.
Whoever wishes to empty out his arm and dissolve his blood in the second place, and his body is strong: then let him do this after seven hours or nine from his first phlebotomy.
Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side of which it hangs down: let him do this on the second or third day.
In whose body is much blood already heated and acute, and causes a rise in fever: let him expel it from this blood in one portion, and extract from it a great quantity: and increase the opening until syncope occurs: after which you must restore the patient to his normal condition, and place his hand over the pulse of his wrist in order that there be no fainting at the place of the syncope. Many times this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and neglects the matter.
And it is not proper when one wishes to empty out the arm and dissolve the blood in the second place, when the opening of the vein is closed, and there is difficulty in the exit of the blood, as it may happen too soon over that which is desired, and cause swelling to extend quickly For indeed that is bad, indeed let him defer it until the second phlebotomy
Or move with the acuteness of the phlebotomy that which has coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and put upon it some salt dissolved in water. And put above it something from tyriaca alfaroch, or sage, and put it under compression lightly, until the blood comes out.
If indeed the bone is fractured, then let it go, and do not hold it tightly, until the fracture settles down.
If indeed the need compels to stop the bleeding by means of a second application, and there is no excuse, then either perform phlebotomy above the place, or in the arm or in another limb.
As for the vein of the arm, phlebotomy is done at the place of the cubitus and the elbow, when they cannot be found, because they are hidden, since they are composed of bones.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is that the patient dips his hand into warm water, until the wound turns red, and the limb appears pale.
Then it is bound up over it with a bandage with moderate constriction medium Then phlebotomy is done in a descending direction rather than horizontally or along the length: and let the opening be wide, and your phlebotomy be as high as the hand that you are lancing beside
If it is forbidden for the blood to flow out, then do it again with the hand in warm water, and let the blood run into the water until you have accomplished your need
If indeed you are in the summer days, then you are excused from the repetition of the hand in warm water. And most of all blood is put to flow in warm water in the cold season.
And the phlebotomy of this limb is safer than all the limbs, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve under it
Phlebotomy of the right hand is useful for ailments of the liver.
The quality of the phlebotomy is such that you should tie the vein close to the hand with a ligature, or your finger, after you have plunged the needle into the water, until the vein has swollen and the patient has felt a sensation of coldness. Then the phlebotomy should be performed across the vein. And if you cut the vein completely, it will not harm him in any way.
And preserve your hand from the phlebotomy. Under these are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh from the bone.
Then put the hand into the warm water, and let the blood flow out of it. For if you do not put your hand into the warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and will be hindered from its course.
When you have drawn out from the blood the quantity necessary, then put on the vein oil and salt: so that it does not clot too quickly.
And thus it is necessary to do with every strict limb.
The treatment of the phlebotomy of the left hand is: because it is useful for ailments of the spleen: and do the same in the phlebotomy of the right hand as you did in the second equally
The saphenous phlebotomy is useful for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the uterus, and retention of menstruation, and weakness of the kidneys, and ulcers of the groin and buttocks, and similar ailments.
The quality of the saphenous phlebotomy is such that you must insert the sick limb into the warm water: and make above it friction, until the vein swells: and tie above the junction of the limb with a bandage The heel is the proper place for the nails, which appear towards the thumb: and they are pulled out from it on the face of the foot in many places.
The veins are to be let out more widely on the greater branch of it, or at the heel in its collection: for this is better and safer
If the veins are let out on the face of the foot, then take care of the nerves which are under them over the face of the foot
And put your vein-cutting through from the transversely, like the one you wish to make: and let the vein be wide.
If, however, the blood is prohibited from coming out, then repeat the foot in hot water: and let the blood run in it until it is evacuated.
If the nail-cutter has gone wrong in the first attempt, then repeat the vein-cutting with the upper part of the limb, for the place is safe and not liable to cause any mischief, when you take care of the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly with the other foot like the saphenous vein of the foot.
The veins of the sciatica nerve are to be found at the heel from the lateral aspect of the ankle bone
And the sign of the vein-cutting of this is for the relief of the pain of the heel, when there is because of the thick blood.
And the quality of the vein-cutting of this is that it should contain an infirm ball, and hasten: and bind up the limb from the side of the heel to above the heel for four fingers, with a fine long bandage: for it does not appear except for this.
When it appears, then the vein-cutting is to be done according to whatever skill you have in your hand, or by means of a transverse section: and it is better either to make an incision or to cut through with a section The place of its [disease] is in the blood, and it is hidden in many men.
The place of its [disease] is in the blood, and it is hidden in many men. If it is not found in the blood, and does not appear to the senses at all: then let a bloodletting be made at some point of its [disease], and let it appear at the ankle or on the heel: and let it run from the blood as much as you will.
Then loosen the tight dressing, and place over the point of the bloodletting the skin, and bind the place firmly. And the disease will soon be healed.
(The text continues with another paragraph.)
Diseases arise from the humours, and from the air, and from bile.
And the temperaments are two in kind. One is by scarification, and by extraction of blood: and the other is by temperaments without scarification
And this temperaments which is without scarification is of two kinds Or it is with fire. Or it is without fire
And the temperaments which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are fourteen in number in the body And there are fourteen temperaments which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood: of which one is the temperaments of Alocri, and is the most remote of the head: and Alkhel, and is the middle of the neck: and the temperaments of Alhagdahim, and are two layers of the neck from two parts together: and the temperaments of menti, and is under the mandible in the lower part of the mouth: and the temperaments of the two palates: and the temperaments of Alachosos over the end of the tail: and the temperaments of the two spleen, and are medium of the two arms: and the temperaments of the two knees: and the temperaments of the two heels.
The wind does not draw blood from small veins scattered throughout the flesh, and because of this it does not cause the production of pus like that which follows phlebotomy. Neither is it necessary to apply the wind either with fire or without fire in any ailment which originates from congestion, until the whole body has been evacuated.</start_of_turn>
If need compels the application of the wind in an ailment, either from the ailment itself or from custom, we administer it at every hour in the beginning, in the end, and in the middle of the month, and whenever it is necessary.</start_of_turn>
For in men when their blood multiplies in it, until it needs to be extracted by the wind, it finds its greatest burden in the head.</start_of_turn
And from pus is that which fills the face, the head, and the neck with repletion and redness.</start_of_turn And from pus is that which causes itching on the face, the forehead, and the eyebrows, and darkness and blurriness in the eyes.</start_of_turn
And from pus is that which makes the area of the wind's action scaly.</start_of_turn And from pus is that which multiplies laughter.</start_of_turn And from pus is that which gives a taste of blood in the mouth: either the tongue becomes floppy and expels blood.</start_of_turn> And from pus is that which multiplies sleep.</start_of_turn And from pus is that which causes vomiting of blood and redness, and itching and swelling, and things which are similar to these.</start_of_turn>
When we see any of these things, and especially if they appear in the middle of the month: we immediately order the application of the wind, after two or three hours have passed.</start_of_turn
The application of the Ventosation of the Neck is as follows: because it itself contributes to the gravity in the head, and what flows down to the eyes. It should be performed after the evacuation of the entire body.
And this is indeed a Ventosation of the Cephalic vein.
It is not permitted to perform it on those who are of a cold complexion, or in whom there is a discharge. For it causes great pain.
It is not permitted to perform it on the elderly, or in whom there is a cold fever in the head
Whoever does it frequently generates above him an aversion
And it is necessary to push the hand downwards with the palm towards the lower parts, fearing the generation of aversion
The Ventosation or Alkehel is a place of phlebotomy of the Vein of the Fusca and of the Vein of the Basilica, and because of this it contributes to asthma, and constriction of the chest, and splitting of the instruments of inspiration, and cough, and distension.
And it is necessary to perform the Alkehel Ventosation downwards, because if it is placed downwards, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach
The alhagdahim Ventosation contributes to headaches, and ophthalmia, and migraine, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is a place of phlebotomy of the Basilica.
And it is necessary to command the practitioner of the Ventosation to delay the hand with the scarification: so that it does not cut the artery, and cause the flow of blood to be cut off
The blowing of air under the chin causes swelling of the saliva in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar ailments which are in the mouth: and it stands in the place of phlebotomy which is in two veins.
The blowing of air from the lungs causes swelling of the saliva, which is reflected back, and heat
The blowing of air from the lungs causes swelling of the saliva, which is reflected back, and heat.
It is necessary, therefore, that the practitioner of the blowing of air should not make too deep a scarification: because the place is stripped of flesh, and under that are nerves and blood vessels.
The blowing of air which is over the teeth causes hemorrhoids of the anus, and ulcers below.
It is necessary, therefore, that the practitioner of the blowing of air should make a great blowing, and that it should be of air: because the place requires strong suction, and perhaps the fine bubbles of the air are broken: and it is made by a great scarification
The bubbles of air from the lungs diminish in size: because they draw blood from the whole body, and cause ancient pains in the ribs, and the uterus, and the testicles: they provoke menstruation, and cause swelling, and redness: and they stand in the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and the marrow bone
They really weaken the body very much, and cause fainting spells in many people.
The phlebotomy of the marrow bone is near to the phlebotomy of the two veins of the legs.
The quality of the position of the veins is such that you should place the inflated bladder in the first cavity and perform temperate suction: and do not prolong the position of the bladder, but place it quickly, and move it quickly, so that the humors come to their proper place in accordance with their natural inclination: and do not cease iterating until the place is already red and distended, and the red blood appears. Then indeed shall you scarify, and repeat the suction gradually. Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
For he who has little flesh and few hairs from among men, it is necessary that he scarifies himself once, not more: so that he does not ulcerate the place
And command the surgeon, that he may amplify the scarification, and deepen slightly: and temper the suction with ease, and speed, and movement of his hand
And if there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary that he scarifies himself twice In the first indeed opens a small opening for the release of the blood, and its swelling: and in the second indeed precise excision of the thick blood
If indeed the blood is black and foul, then make a third incision: in order to achieve the end.
And finally, when we wish to extract the blood gradually, or little by little, sufficeth us one incision. And if we wish to extract much blood, we shall make many incisions
And if we measure, that the blood is thick: then it is necessary that he be scarred deeply: and the equal end of the incision is the depth of the skin.
What is that which it is necessary to administer from oils concerning the position of the veins, and what is the cause of the swelling?
When the skin is large, hard, tough, and its pores are narrow, it is necessary to anoint the area with open, softening, and resolving oils: such as the oil of almond, or oil of marigold, or sweet fennel oil, or oil of pumpkin seed.
And if it is winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or mastic: and such like these.
If there is excessive fat that is cold: then olive oil, or balsam oil, or almond oil, or nut oil: and such like these.
If there is swelling that is full of pores, tough meat: then it is necessary to prevent the oil from adhering, and to wash the area with rose water, or cold water, or warm water, or cucumber water, or vinegar water: and such like these.
He who has blood of much moisture should bathe the swelling with vinegar, or Myrtle water, and sage: and such like these.
He whose fat is thick, bathe the swelling with old wine, or chamomile tea, or fennel decoction, or camomile: and such like these.
And it is necessary to heat the swelling in a bath, or in a bathhouse, and it is better to give medication after coming out of the bath for an hour, or two hours.
And let no one sleep after the treatment
What is necessary before treating the swelling, or performing a bloodletting before the treatment?
And after that it is necessary to consider: then if the swelling is choleric, or the bloodletting is excessive, and the colour of the blood is increased and inflamed: then it is necessary to take cold, such as pomegranate seeds: and also garlic with vinegar and lettuce, and rue, and chamomile: and such like these.
Place the cushions under the head and the body, and the meats of the wounds will grow soft, and the contents of the wounds with barley: and thus are they similar.
If the swelling is cold, it is necessary to take in a pot of honey syrup, or of aloes, or of rue seeds made: and take a moderate-smelling liquid, which is between urine and blood: and it is prescribed that it should be taken sparingly of food. Place the cushions under the head and the body, and the meats: and passeroes, that is, feathers of doves: and the cushions of wool shall be made soft.
It is necessary that the liquid of the drink should be more than the food: and it is necessary that it be taken in a vessel with some people in the hours of twilight, or a medicine of musk, that is, myrrh, or alum before vomiting, or after: so as to comfort the principal parts and to temper the blood. It is not necessary to take anything hot in the pot.
Of swelling without incision. Swelling, however, which is without incision, are Venous which are placed over the spleen, and kidney, and heel, and over the belly, belly-button, and the place of the kidney: because these members do not suffer incision over themselves.
And it is not asked for by ease, except for the drawing out from a blood vessel to a limb: thus do we place the Venous over the breasts in the flux of blood from the veins And we must take care that the swelling from a limb is not caused by cold moisture remaining in the limb: thus do we place the swelling over the belly, and the belly-button The limb itself does thereby render itself rare, and heats it, and removes the pain thereby, because it resolves the swelling.
It is also placed upon the kidneys, when it happens in the bowels of hair, or gravel The bile itself may cause an opening of the hair, or remove the stone from its place.
It does the same when it is placed upon the kidney and the spleen to restrain the swelling in both of them.
These winds are given with a section only. And sometimes they are given with fire.
And sometimes they are given with lukewarm water in wounds: and this is that the wind be applied, and be great, only with lukewarm water, or water in which herbs which are suitable are boiled
The form of the wind given with fire is like this:
Its breadth is two outstretched fingers wide, as we have formed it: and its depth is half of a palm: and its side is in the middle of it, a small hole, according to the quantity of the substance which is poured in: it is made of air, or citrine, of thick and thin margins, soft and equal, rough: so that it does not harm the limb in its position above it: and there is in the middle of it a transverse wire of air or iron, on which a candle is placed with fire.
And it is made thus, this wind is great, greater than we have said, and somewhat less than that, according to the ailments and the age of the one who uses it
The winds of children are violent and extenuating are those of youths, and of fat men
The quality of placing this dampness with fire over the limb is that you raise the license with fire from the belly of the intestines, or cause a burning lamp from pitch: and place it over the middle of the veins which are in the middle of the dampness. So that the fire may be raised around the lower part of the dampness, that the body of the patient may not be burnt.
Then the flame is placed over the limb: and the finger rests on the hole which I mentioned, until the dampness has been sufficiently dried out: when we have dried out, we remove the finger, and the vapor escapes from that hole, and the dampness is immediately cured.
Then light the license according to its method, and do it again, if you have not dried out the latter.
But in the case of the moistness which is administered in pulmonary dropsy with water, there is no vein which is crossed or hole: and it is not administered, except that it is filled with water, and is placed over the limb only.
This is its form.
And the more this moistness is great, that it may seize much water, the better
Of the suspension of blood-sugar.
Blood-sugars are not administered in many places, except in those places where it is not possible to position the dampness, because of their thinness, such as the lip, and the tongue, and things like that.</start_of_turn> Or in a limb stripped of flesh, such as the finger, and the nose, and things like that.</start_of_turn
And the quality of using these things is: that you should draw from blood-sugars which are in sweet waters, far from putrefaction.</start_of_turn
Then they are sent forth by day and night in sweet water, until the patients are satiated, and nothing remains within them. Then the body is evacuated first with a phlebotomy, and with enema. Then drain the limb of the patient, until it turns red Then oil is poured upon it
When they are finished, and they have gone, and it is possible to suck out the place with an enema: this is the last treatment. And if this is not possible, then extract the place with vinegar Then with much water, and it is rubbed, and squeezed out.
If the course of the blood is prolonged after the case of bloodletting, and this is due to its evacuation: then pour oil over a linen cloth in cold water, and put it over the place, until the discharge is stopped
If blood is multiplied, then sprinkle over it ground sumac or gall, and similar things from sponges: until the blood is stopped.
Or apply over the place middle parts of scraped sponges: and send them forth, until the sponges adhere to the place, for the blood is stopped.
And it is necessary if necessary to repeat the bloodletting, when it is possible, to change the methods.
But if bloodletting is prohibited from suspension, then evacuate the place with blood recently. Or keep vinegar in the places, until something comes out of the blood Then they are put on, for when they feel something from the blood, they adhere immediately
When they wish that they should go away, sprinkle over them something from ground aloe, or salt, or ash: and they go away immediately.
This chapter is also very necessary in the art of Medicine, and is the restoration of fracture, and dislocation of the accidents of bones.
Note, my sons, that those who speak of this chapter carelessly of the doctors and the learned men, and who have never read any of the ancient books, nor learned anything from them.
And because of this cause, this method is hidden from the sciences in our land. And I have not learned of this from anyone good at all, and I am not worthy of this from this, except for the length of my study of the ancient books, and my consideration of their intellect, until I have extracted the science from them
Then I have adhered to experience and the length of my life.
And I have described to you in this chapter all that contains my science: and beyond what has passed my experience, after I have abbreviated this for you, and I have published this in order to abbreviate, and I have finished with the explanation of declension: and I have formed many forms of instruments which are administered in this, as well as from the addition of declension, as I did in the two preceding chapters
Chapter II.
It is necessary, as we said in the prologue of this chapter, to recall the main points and chapters which are necessary for a skilled artisan to arrive at his station concerning the truth of things: for example, those who are proud and arrogant, or who are puffed up with pride, will learn nothing from you, and others will be put off by your arrogance.
When any fracture, dislocation, twist, or falling has happened to anyone: then it is necessary immediately to attend to drawing out the blood and healing the wound itself, or both together: if nothing hinders it, such as weakness of spirit: or because of some other cause, such as a young man who is proud or an old man who is decrepit: or because of the passing of time, or the approach of cold or heat.
Then let him be content with his food of bread, cold herbs, and birds' meat, and with cold drinks: and let him abstain from wine, and from fat meats, and let him drink from food and from every kind of food which fills the veins. Until then, when he is secure from the hot bath, and no longer has any discharge from the wound: then let the sick person return to his ordinary regimen which he is accustomed to.
When the fractured bone begins to heal, then it is necessary for the sick person to eat nourishing and sustaining foods in great quantity: such as porridge made from wheat cooked with water, barley, head cheese, feet, beans, oil, and fish which are fresh: and strong drink, and things like these. With this regimen the coagulation of the fracture will be faster and better.
And you know that bones which are fractured when they are in the limbs of those who are in their prime of life and decrepit, are not able to continue and consolidate according to their natural course because of the wasting away of the limbs: and they consolidate and continue only as much as the hardness of the sinews which remain.
Truth be told, nature itself adds something akin to glue to a fractured bone from every side, which is its toughness, which adheres and contracts it until it solidifies into one piece, and which is bound into one piece until it reaches the limit of strength and firmness, just as it did from the beginning, until it hinders nothing from its operations. For this reason, it is necessary to provide the sick person with food which contains abundance, viscosity and toughness, as we have said.
And know this, that the kinds of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs: for instance, a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head: and a fracture of the chest is different from a fracture of the back: and similarly all the other limbs are diverse one from another. And I come with the recollection of the kind of fracture which is exposed in the chapter which is distinguished from others. The kinds of fractures of bones are also diverse in themselves.
For instance, a fracture may be bowed, besides the fact that they happen in bones with fissures. And sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and there are fractures of the wrist, that is, fissures, and protrusions, such as in the pen, when the knife is applied to write. Neither is it from breakage: and it is a fracture with wound and disruption at the head: and it is a slight fracture.
And every kind has its own wisdom, or its own instrument for restoration, according to what is remembered of it, distinguished in its places
From which it is known that the fracture of the bone is its crookedness, and its prominence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you press it.
When there is no obvious displacement of the bone, no sound from the touch of the hand when touching the bone with movement, and no great pain is found: then there is no fracture, but it is possible that there is displacement or a small fissure. It is not necessary to move the limb with the hand and compression in every case, but rather to place above it something from the physicians which they remember, after which the limb will be bound tightly.
You also know that when a limb is bent and breaks into two, except when the break happens at the same time as the fracture, all the parts are actually displaced from their place. Therefore, it is necessary for you to start from the moment you suspect such a fracture to restore its position, making it even before the swelling has gone down
But if there happens to be a swelling after the fracture, then leave it for a few days until the swelling has subsided. Then restore it as well as you can with whatever gentleness and skill you can manage.
You also know that the restoration of the limb and its straightening is easier than the bone itself, in which the break happened at the same time as the fracture.
Then bind it tightly as you remember it
If there are fragments of bone in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this fractured limb from two parts, if the hand exists, or the foot: or with the hand, if the limb is small: or with two strings, or with a bandage and a hand.
And let your position be such as you place the limb over the place in equilibrium, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then try to make the fragments rejoin by any means, and in any way you can manage in those places: and be careful according to your strength, so as not to cause greater pain or damage to the patient through your treatment, and try with all your strength to apply one bone to its companion, according to the better forms
It is necessary in this hour that you try and grasp your hand. If there is anything different there, make it right and equal it out according to your strength
Cause the extension to be firm and the compression to be strong, like many stones Many of them make the limb swell for the operation or cause contraction in the limb: as we have seen with these operations many times.
Then bind after the equalization, and lower the operation, and tighten the limb, and rest, and tranquility: and watch over the patient above all Make him lie down, that he does not move in the hour of sleep, and that he rests during the revolution of the stars, and the agitation of the stars, and during the egestion of the stars, and all his movements until his last strength is spent And that the position of the limb should not be the position that follows pain. That is, because when he feels pain in the position of the limb, or an injury: then it is necessary to change it to another position from which he does not feel pain
And that the position of his body should be equal and straight: so that there is no deformation of the limb when restoring it.
The quality of the tightening of the limb is according to what is narrated.
You know that broken limbs are diverse in their parts, and their magnitude, and their shape
Which are small, such as the arm, and the finger, and the bone, and things of that kind, then it is necessary to use soft packing, fine Whatever is large within the body, such as the hip and thigh, must have a wide and firm covering.
Since a wide ligament connects the great limb and stretches it evenly from all sides, it does not permit any protrusion of its substance.
Then, after you have evacuated the bowels, apply an ointment that is appropriate for the fracture in a soft cushion over the place of the fracture itself. Then, cover the place of the fracture with three or four layers of ligament, and bind your hand firmly with the ligament.
Then, keep it close to the upper part of the fracture site, and bind less tightly than the tension you used to put on the fractured place. Then, support the limb with a wide bandage from the fracture site downwards, and gradually soften the tension until you can remove the great part of the limb from the wound
Then, do the same thing again, and cover the place of the fracture once more with layers of ligament Then, support the limb from the fracture downwards. And let your operation be in the tension of the bandage and the softening of it, as we said in the first bandage
Then, put between the layers of the bandage a soft cushion, or cloth, so that the fracture is even in it, if there is a curve in it: and if there is no curve in it, do not put anything in it.
Then, cover the previous bandage once more. Then, keep the upper part of both layers of bandage perfectly centered, if there is no swelling, and no hard swelling
If there is swelling or an abscess, then place above it what sits upon that abscess, and it will remove the swelling: and discharge it in a few days. Then string above it those things which you have placed.
And let the things which you have placed be of the middle of broad cane, rounded, formed with wisdom: or let them be of wood whence cribra are made, which are made of twig, or chaff, that is, palm branches, or nails: and let the breadth of every thing be according to this form, and this same figure.
But it is necessary that the thing which is placed above that which is drawn, be greater and broader than the rest of the things: and the length of the thing be according to what is fitting for the limb from its magnitude and thinness
Then string above the things as before, according to the first measure. Then bind above with cords which are slightly slack, according to what we said concerning the measure: and it is that the measure should be greater over the place of the fracture: and the more it is prolonged from the fracture, the smaller the measure
And it is necessary that the cords be of middle thickness and softness, and be of soft wood
For if the cords are thick, like oil from the operation of tying knots in the cord, it is a great error: for the measure falls from the thing which is being measured.
And thin cords do not suffice: for you do not follow with the measure with that which you wish.
And it is not necessary that there should be less than a finger between the things and the thing which is being measured
If the patient is pained by the extremities of the things after the measure in healthy places: then put under the things a cushion of soft wool, or carded yarn, until nothing is pained from it
When there is a fracture with a wound, and a disruption of the tissue occurs, I will remind you of this in Chapter Two concerning individuality.
You know that not every fractured limb should be bound with stitches from the first day. For a large limb, it is not necessary to put on more stitches than are absolutely necessary, except after five or seven or more days, according to the safety of the patient's condition
This is how the ancients made plasters, which are placed over a fracture and dislocation
The common method of plastering is useful for restoring a fracture and is suitable for various temperaments, especially women and children: because it does not cause heat or cold to adhere to it
Take fine flour from the mill, and the bran that hangs on the sides of the millstones during the grinding: mix these in the way that the coarse parts are not too thick, nor too fine. Use this for making the plaster.
Another method of plastering for fracture, dislocation and torsion Honey, laudanum, acacia, enula, mugath: mix these with ten parts myrrh and five parts aloes, and some alethil. Blend them with water or with milk if the patient's complexion is hot. Use this plaster. For it is a good composition, it restores the fractured bones quickly, and gives strength to various people.
Another method of plastering, which also strengthens fractures and torsions Recipe: Mix mugath, mess, and white alum, with ten myrrh and five aloes, with six acacia and twenty drops of Armenia. All these together should be boiled until all the contractions are gone, and should be cribellated and bound with water, or vinegar or oil.
Recipe: Mix mugath, mess, and white alum, with ten myrrh and five aloes, with six acacia and twenty drops of Armenia. Boil until contractions cease, then cribellate and bind with liquid, such as water, vinegar, or oil. Apply a soft wool and soak in vinegar, and lay on the place.
This plaster is not for restoring, but is good for calming post-inflammatory swelling. It removes pain naturally.
Method for plastering a fractured bone. Take leaves of ficus surda and leaves of wild balsam: mix them all up and make plaster from both of them.
Method of abbreviated plastering for the restoration of a fractured bone: when you desire to resolve the remaining swelling after the fracture has healed Recipe: Mix white alum, chamomile, violets, and barley flour, with one part each. Boil all together and bind with wine, if the limb is not warm.
If the limb is warm, mix it with humid brandy or water, and use that
Another method of plastering for the resolution of a fracture, stronger than the first, when swelling has become firm in the restoration of the limb Recipe: Mix white alum, linseed seed, barley, beeswax, honey, chamomile, and violets, with one part each. Boil all together and bind with salish water, or sweet water, or wine The whole of that is according to the heat of the limb and the quiet of its heat.
The whole of that is in accordance with the heat of the limb and the tranquility of its heat.

If the limb has not recovered from the ailment in three, or four, or five, or seven days, it is not to be treated any further. When the whole ailment has ceased for twenty days, according as the appearance of the limb's recovery, as we have said, until the fracture has healed and the coagulation of the flesh has approached: then add in the tightening more than the first tightening throughout: and also add in the swelling of the food of the infirm person, as it preceded the reminder of its restoration.
If, however, the limb has lost the place of the fracture, and has been extended more than is necessary: then you know that the nourishment is withheld from it Treat it therefore with warm water at all times while you are treating it, and keep it in all three days, and reduce the tightening.
By this operation, the limb receives nourishment and recovers quickly.
What those who restore the fracture of the limb do by means of medicine, when they do not restore it at first, as it should be, and restore it contrary to its nature, is an error in their operation, and a great fear: for if it had been right, the ancients would have said so in their books, and they would have operated in this way before
I have never seen any evidence of this in this work, and it is better that it should not be done
On the treatment of an accident in the head.
There are various kinds of fractures, and their figures are many: and their causes are diverse.
For a fracture is what is made by a blow with a weapon: and the blow raises the whole limb up until it reaches the cartilage, which is under the bone, as does the axis in wood: and for this reason this kind of fracture is called Axial
If an edge of a bone has fractured and has split its face, and the incision has not pierced to its utmost depth: this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, complete fracture.
There are two kinds of fractures, either great or small
A fracture is either a break or a crack: the cause of which is impact with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or something similar.
The latter fracture is either penetrating or non-penetrating: the former when it approaches the nerve which is under the bone, or the latter when it is in the face of the bone. This kind of fracture is also called Kalaan, that is, complete fracture.
And there is also a hidden fracture in the bone under the cover of hair: this is a small fracture, and for this reason it is called the capillary fracture.
And there is also a fracture which is caused by a blow or by percussion of a stone, or by something similar, which breaks through the layers of the bone inwards, and makes a concavity: just as happens with the winds of the air when there is percussion, and some of them go inwards
And this usually happens in the heads of soft bones, such as those of children
And all these kinds of fractures are separated by swelling, and I will remind you of the whole thing in its place.
We recognize all these kinds of fractures by their appearance above the surface, and by their inquiry with tension, and by the excision of the corrupted flesh which is above them
The capillary fracture is recognized by the fact that it is seen on the bone, and is stripped off, and is covered with ointment: the fracture appears black
In treating fractures, consider first the patient's condition: then, if you find signs of obvious significance above the fear of death, such as vomiting of bile, extension, loss of consciousness, cutting of the tongue, syncope, acute fever, discharge of urine, redness of the face, and similar signs in various positions, it is unlikely that they will recover: and if you find no serious signs, even if you hope for recovery, then begin to treat them.
If a patient comes to you wounded in the first instance with a wound: and it is in the cold season, then it is necessary to study the removal of bone before the fourteenth day in every position.
And if it is in the warm season, then it is necessary to take care to remove the bone before the seventh day, before it becomes corrupted due to the marrow, and these are the accidents which we have mentioned
If a fracture of a bone has gone to the marrow touching the brain, and is with small pieces, and attraction: then it is necessary to cut off the broken and protruding part, and draw it out, as we have said
It is necessary to rotate the head of the wounded person: and uncover the bone as much as possible in any way you can: and according to the figure of the wound, and what is best for the patient.
If blood flows from the fracture of the bone, or if there is a swelling of the bone: then oppose it with that which is necessary And it is necessary to apply a place with soaked linen in wine, and wet plaster: and make the wound quiet, until the swelling subsides, and be sure to prevent bleeding. Then begin the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
And thus it is done according to one of two methods.
And thus it is done according to one of two methods. The first method is to cut the bone with the Incisor tooth firmly grasping the precipice: this is its form.</start_of_turn>
And thus it is done according to one of two methods. The first method is to hold the Incisor firmly with one hand and grasp the wider part of the Incisor with the other hand: this is its form.</start_of_turn>
And thus it is done according to one of two methods. The first method is to hold the Incisor firmly with one hand and grasp the wider part of the Incisor with the other hand.
And the second method is to have several different Incisors: some of which are wider than others, and some of which are narrower than others: and they should be in the end of greatest sharpness, and should be of iron or steel, and should be used with ease in striking upon the Incisor so that it does not fracture the head and does not damage it.</start_of_turn
If, however, the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary to perforate its circumference before administering the Incisors, with needles which are called Non-penetrating Needles: and they are not called thus except when they do not penetrate to the end of the bony tissue towards that which is behind it: because the Needle is a rounded extremity above that which is under the acute angle, like the margin, and a small circle prevents it from submerging and penetrating the thickness of the bone.</start_of_turn>
And it is fitting to take from these needles a great number, of which each one is suitable for the quantity of thickness of the bone, until present there be a Needle throughout the whole circumference: the quantity of the acute extremity of which is in length and breadth is according to the quantity of thickness of that circumference.</start_of_turn
And this is the form of the three kinds of needles, or Trepanas.</start_of_turn
The quality of the perforation in the circumference of a fractured bone is thus: when you place your thumb over the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced. Then move the thumb to another place and place something between every hole an amount equal to the thickness of the radius, or thereabouts
Then use the scissors between every hole in the bone: and make it finer than the thickness of the bone at its widest point, as we have said, until you have pierced the bone, or your hand, or something else which you may be using for this purpose: such as tweezers and fine needles.
And it is necessary to take care, lest you touch the thumb, or any instrument with the scissors
When you have therefore surrounded the bone with the perforation, and it has been separated from the surrounding tissue, if it remains connected with the bone by something, you must extract it with another instrument, and you must keep the parts which remain in the bone even with the instrument itself However, it is necessary to make it thin and fine with other scissors.
If anything small remains from the bones, and fragments: grasp them with ease with the thing which is near to you among the instruments. Then take care of the wound afterwards according to the instructions which we have given, and of the unguents which we mentioned.
And another method of operation is easy, especially for those who are afraid: which Galenus praised and praised highly: and this is his saying It is not necessary in the first place to begin to remove a part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more severe and more evident: until you have detected that part and placed under it the tip of this lens-shaped instrument.
And the blunt part of the lens does not yield anything: and its acute part in two of its sides widens in length, like water: so that the blunt part of the lens lies close to the sac, and the acute part of it is directed towards the bone.
Then strike through the incisor from one side with a small mallet until you have cut through the whole bone easily, as it returns: and you will be safe from the spur, which does not happen in this case, which you feared beforehand.
And if the physician is not stupid among men, and is not ignorant of it, or is not asleep, then if anything remains attached to the bone from the spur in some places, he will cut it off from it with the extremity of the lens itself, and will free it from it easily. It is freed from it without pain, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate the sac, and that which is detached from the bone is its face, and there remain on it asperities and subtle elevations: then it is necessary to remove those asperities, and to rasp off those elevations with fine files of various sizes, so that it is possible to administer from them in every place where it is convenient, and to make them more upright, according to what the operation leads you to do, and to the fractured bone and its figure And you must administer with your reason, as in the first place, the wider of these files. Then use the finer one afterwards
And you must administer with your reason, as in the first place, the wider of these files. Then use the finer one afterwards And do not cease to do this until you have brought it to the point of administering the finest and most subtle ones of them all
With every small fracture remaining of such bones, and the fracture being subtle, you must take care, according to what leads to its rectification.
It is a thing which is not hidden above all, concerning which there is study in this art, and it has remained above what we have written, and we shall show it in great fractures.
If, however, a blood clot remains detained when you expand the bone: then it is necessary that you take hold of the clot, according to the quantity of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound. Then take another clot, either doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first clot: and make it as easy as possible for him to breathe over it, so that he does not gasp.
Then administer above it a broad ligament: and do not bind it, except for the quantity which maintains the wound: and let it go when it has healed, either on the first day or the second day, until it is secure from a hot after-effect. Then rest it, and administer afterwards medicines which are superfluous for such a condition: such as the roots of lily, and herbs flour, and barley flour, and gentian, and the like: and it is necessary that you make from these medicines a powder, which is to be scattered over the wound like dry dust.
And generally administer all medicines which have the property of drying, and do not bite And be careful according to your skill, that the wound be soft in your care: neither greasy, nor biting.
And be careful according to your skill, that the wound be soft in your care: neither greasy, nor biting. Neither let blood congeal on it in any way: for when blood congeals on a blood clot of the brain, it corrupts it, and putsrefies it, and brings about great harm afterwards: and this happens in fainting of the head, when it is neglected its care.
Consider therefore at this time, if any accident befalls a patient, that you know it is perilous to delay treatment.
If it does not happen, except by some medicine which is put upon him, and is in the benefit of that medicine, then it must be taken from the belly one part, from the cheek three parts, and lines with the thread of silk as much as is necessary.</start_of_turn> Then put it upon the wound: afterwards care for it with the means of treatment which are suitable, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
When the fracture has been made, restoration must be made.
You know that the nose is not fractured except when two of its upper parts are fractured together, or one of them: because they are two bones: for the lower one of them is cartilaginous, does not fracture, and does not happen to it except for attrition, and twisting, and simulation.</start_of_turn
If one of the two parts is fractured, then it must be taken in hand that you introduce the little finger into the hole of the nose, and equal the fracture with your index finger, and thumb deformed, until the nose returns to its natural position: and do this with art, with ease.</start_of_turn And beware, that you do not cause further pain to the patient by your operation.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and does not reach to the nail: then it must be equaled at the end of the radius where there is a small thickness.</start_of_turn
If indeed the fracture is in two parts, then do the same: and be careful with the restoration of it on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.</start_of_turn And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the after-boil of the warm bath.
And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the after-boil of the warm bath.
And some of the ancient restorers say that they should be infused with butter, and change them every day. And this indeed does not seem to me, but it is better that the linen be infused with alum and pounded with fine flour And then remove the linen, until the bone is firm, and apply ointment.
And when the linen has been placed in the nose in the place of the sponge of the quill, after it has been covered over with a soft cloth: and thereby the fracture of the nose is held more securely, and that the diseased man does not suffer from excessive inspiration
This is not absolutely necessary. If you wish, do so: and if you wish, do the linen
If the nose happens again while working the after-boil of the warm bath, plaster the nose with gypsum, or with butter infused with rose oil, or with some unguents from chamomile
If the warm bath does not happen again, then it is better to plaster it with millet flour and pounded barley mixed with alum. And then put upon it a soft cushion, and do not bind the nose with anything whatsoever.
If indeed the bones of the nose are slightly fractured, or displaced, then it is necessary to split open above them and extract them with the instruments that are appropriate to that purpose Then cut the vein, and care for the wound with that which is contained, and consolidate it with suitable patches or bands.
If it happens between the nose and the nail, then it is necessary, so care for the wound with ligatures: and administer a lead cannula until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured.</start_of_turn>
When the lower jaw is fractured and its fracture is not associated with a wound: then look to see if its fracture is only lateral and not fractured into two pieces, and it is cured inwards: then its knowledge is easy.</start_of_turn
It is necessary therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, to introduce the index finger of the left hand into the fracture: in the same way if the fracture is on the left side, then introduce the index finger of the right hand: and press with this what is inward of the fracture until it is brought out through the outer part of the bone with the other hand which is opposite to the inner part, and with this make it equal.</start_of_turn
If the fracture of the jaw has already been separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer the external fixation from both parts, according to the rule: until it is possible to equalize it.</start_of_turn
If, however, such an accident happens in the teeth, either a fracture or a dislocation: then string those which you hope will remain with a gold wire, or silver wire, or silk thread.</start_of_turn Then put over the fractured jaw a bandage.</start_of_turn Then put over it a doubled bandage, and put over the bandage a large felt pad made in the center: or a piece of sole leather of equal length to the jaw.</start_of_turn
Then bind up the part above, according to what is prepared for this ligation, and it is suitable for its application, until it is not destroyed: and command the patient to be calm and quiet: and give him food soft and liquid.
If, however, you think that something has altered in the figure or in the mode: then act promptly and solve it on the third day. Then rectify what has been altered from that, and cover it with fine flour, with alum or with pounded barley, after you have removed the dressing: and place over the covering wool cloth.
While that plaster remains attached to that, and the arrangement of the bone is not altered, leave it in peace, do not touch it, until it is healed: or bind the fracture Many times this fracture is bound in three weeks.
If in the meantime a callous swelling should happen, then manage it as we said many times in its sedation, until that swelling is removed
And if the fracture is with a wound, consider it. For if it is separated from the bone fragment, or from the surrounding parts: then take care of this, so that you support the fragment of the fracture with that which agrees with its ablation from the instruments.
If indeed the opening of the wound is strict, then enlarge it with a phlebotome according to the quantity of necessity.
Then when you have removed that fragment, and nothing remains of it from that, close the wound, if it is wide: and if not, place over it the patches which agree with that, and bind it, until it is healed
On the restoration of the collarbone when it is fractured.
Many times the Furcula is fractured from the anterior part towards the humerus, and its fracture is made according to one of three measures.
Or it is fractured and separated into two, besides which they happen in these positions: and it is easier for its restoration.
Or that they happen in the bone positions: and it is more difficult for its restoration.
Or that there is a fracture with a wound.
And the operation in this case when the fracture is without a wound, is that you make present two assistants, one of whom supports the fractured Furcula, and the other extends the limb above the part
Then equalize the fracture with your fingers, until its form is made, according to what is necessary: and it should not be prominent, neither concave.
If it does not straighten with extension, then it is necessary to put under the patient's heel a ball of wool, or leather: and let the size of it be according to the quantity of necessity. And extend and elevate the Furcula, and cover the ball with your hand, until the fracture is equal, according to what is necessary.
If it is not possible to pull out the extremity of the Furcula outwards: because it has gone deep: then it is necessary to recline the patient upon his cushion: and put under his humerus the middle finger of his hand in magnitude, and press the minister of his humerus downwards, until the bone of the Furcula which is in the depth is lifted up: and then straighten the fracture, and equalize it with your fingers
If however you feel numbness from the Furcula, and movement: then it is necessary to find over that and pull it out gently
If, however, there is a retraction in the bone, then you must engage the ingenuity in the incision with one of the Incisors which you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the Forceps an instrument which serves to restrain the blood vessel: and this is an instrument made of wood, or of iron. This is its form.</start_of_turn>
It is shaped like a spiral which has no curvature.</start_of_turn
And its width should be according to the size of the bone, and its thickness.</start_of_turn Its length should also be as great as possible for the operation.</start_of_turn>
And it should have two extremities, like arms: and one extremity should be wide, and the other narrow.</start_of_turn
If, however, there is a disruption of the wound which you cut when you extracted the marrow of the bone, is wide, and secure from the after-effect of heat: then you should join together the two lips of the wound with a suture.</start_of_turn
And if the disruption is small, or sometimes there is a slight heat of the after-effect: then you should close the wound with stitches and wool, and pieces according to the quantity of the wound.</start_of_turn
And if there is a heat of the after-effect, then you should pour oil over the wound which has been closed, and vinegar, and wine, and put over it.</start_of_turn
The hardening of the bone when there is no wound, and no section, is, as you put over the bone a plaster made from flour of wheat with alum or eggs.</start_of_turn And put a soft cushion over it.</start_of_turn And then put a sphere under its head if you do not digest it.</start_of_turn Then take the sponge, that is, the wheel which the Saracens hold, which is long and wide: and its breadth be like that of a palm of the hand, or somewhat less. Then place a doubled towel over the sponge and the plaster. Then take a piece of sponge from a thin board, which is as wide as three fingers and as long as such. Then wrap the sponge in cloth Then wrap the plaster with the sponge which is held together with the sponge in the place which falls over the fracture and the area Then place the fracture over the fracture in such a way as to turn it back, and wrap the sponge over the neck of the fracture and under the healthy tissue, and under the diseased tissue: and reduce the sponge over all parts, and as much as the surrounding structure allows, for the structure which is not seen over the bone which is fractured should not be disturbed by the sponge And for this reason it is necessary to change the bandage every day. Whenever the ligament is softened, and when the sponge is removed: then make it straight, and tighten the ligament.
Then place the patient's sleep on his back, and put under his sleep at his side a small pillow at night, so that when he wakes he will be helped from the side of himself The fracture of the collarbone is elevated by the elevation of the arm.
Or bind his arm to his side: and do not break the ligament, if it does not happen of itself, or from a wound, up to twelve days
Then renew the plaster if you wish to see his face to that. And add in stricture, and let it go, until it returns and clots.
And fracture of the bone is held together and is comforted according to many in eighty days: and sometimes in some men in a less degree.</start_of_turn>
Of the restoration of the fracture of the Spatula bone.</start_of_turn>
Rarely does the Spatula bone fracture, and in its wide place: and they do not fracture from it except for the margins of it.</start_of_turn
When therefore it fractures from that place, and fractures in the middle of it, and is not recognized except by touch: then according to the form of the fracture one must prepare its repair.</start_of_turn And reduce it super the natural figure in every way of ingenuity, which is possible.</start_of_turn
Then put upon the place powder of pounded wheat with alum, and a soft bandage, and put on top a little piece of cloth doubled.</start_of_turn Then put upon it a broad bandage from a thin board according to the quantity of the whole Spatula, or somewhat more.</start_of_turn
If indeed under the bandage there is a concavity in some place of the Spatula, then equalize that concavity with soft padding, until the bandage descends according to equality.</start_of_turn
Then bind around it with strong thread of long length, gentle constriction, and firmness of the bandage, until it does not move from its place.</start_of_turn
And consider the ligament in every day.</start_of_turn Every time therefore it is softened the ligament, bind it up, and equalize the bandage if it moves from its place: and let the patient lie upon his side on the healthy side.</start_of_turn
The spatula is restored in ninety days, or in ninety-five days.
When this number is completed, then the ligament is healed: and you will be secure For the bones from which the ligament is composed do not dissolve in time, nor is their solution
If, however, it proceeds from a bone that is fractured under the skin, and projects above: then you must cut above it and remove it. And do as we said in the fracture of the collarbone from the softening of the post-traumatic swelling, if anything be added to this
About the restoration of the fracture of the breastbone
The breastbone sometimes fractures in the middle, and this is rare. Its extremities are indeed most frequently fractured and become separated by its accidents
When it fractures in the middle, which inclines downwards, and there is pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps vomiting of blood, and a displacement of the fractured bone which is not hidden from sense. The restoration of such a fracture is that the patient should rest on his back: and put between his spatulas a powder of wool or the like.
Then join his arms, and bind the ribs from two sides with hands: and make them even with each other, as much as possible, according to every way that it is possible for this and that it agrees, until the figure of the bone returns, according to what is necessary
Then place upon it a plaster and stupp, and put above it a bandage from a thin board of willow, or charcoal, and from lead or similar things in lightness, after you have bound up the hand in cloth Then carefully tighten the ligature above the fractured bone, so that it does not move: and keep it with the ligature according to the curve of the skin around the joint, and tighten it with a proper tension.
Consider the ligature at all times, and whenever it is relaxed, tighten it: and if its necessity arises due to swelling or corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or pus: then remove it, and drain the swelling, and rectify what has happened in the manner of its treatment.
Reduce the swelling, if necessary for this: and bind it tightly, until it is healed.
When the ribs are fractured, restoration is as follows.
You know that a fracture of the ribs does not happen except in the large places following the back, and from the extremities of them from the front part.</start_of_turn> And it does not happen except by pressure, because they are cartilaginous.</start_of_turn And its knowledge is not hidden from the sense in its inquiry with the fingers.</start_of_turn
And its restoration is done in this way, that it equals the fracture with the fingers according to the possible mode, until the figure is equal, according to what is necessary.</start_of_turn Then plaster it, and bind the fractured bone with a needle, if necessary for that.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture of the ribs is downward towards the inside: then there is severe pain that increases, and swelling, like the swelling which occurs in those who have a pleura: because the bone is pierced or broken, and there is also difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and blood-stained urine: and this is a difficult healing.</start_of_turn
The ancients were skillful in these matters with many devices: and from them are those who say that you should apply remedies to the sick which generate inflammation and swelling, so that the belly becomes inflamed, expands, and drives a fracture to the exterior.
We must indeed shun any cause of hasty healing that might produce a cold abscess, if this does not happen But if this does happen, then it is added to it.
And some of them say: put on a wet dressing over the swelling, then bandage it with force, and this is similar to the ratiocination. But truly, it is said that it attracts swelling to the place, by the power of the broken bones.
And some say: it is necessary that the place should cooperate with the wool which is submerged in hot fat: and they put in pulses between the ribs, until it is firmly bound: so that there is an even ligation when you pull it according to the roundness
Then care for the sick with food and medicine
That if it binds the sick person too tightly with what he cannot tolerate, and the bone is pierced with a painful wound, and we fear over the sick person: then it is necessary to split open over the place, and to remove the fractured part.</start_of_turn> Then we put on over these instruments that maintain the bowels, whose memory has preceded: and we break the bone easily, and break it itself.</start_of_turn>
Then we gather up two lips of the wound, if it is great with a suture: and we care for it with poultices, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
If in the meantime a cold abscess occurs, then dry it off, and pour in pulses on the fat, and put on it: and care for the sick with this which agrees with the abscess.</start_of_turn

If this happens at a fracture of a limb, or anything that is separated from its bone: then it is necessary to strip over the skin, and to raise that. Then join together two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures Then care for it with some nourishment, from unguents, until it is healed.
If indeed it is fractured at the end of the bone of the heel, and the heel is finished: then it is necessary to put the little finger of the left hand into the heel, and to equalize the fractured bone, as much as is possible, and to support the second with an equal.
Then place above it, and raise it: and care for the wound with the care that has gone before, until it is healed
Of the restoration of the ankle
Chapter 11
Rarely are the bones of the ankle fractured If they are fractured, then the fracture of them is not, except for a comminution at the extremities of them: and they are split in length, and are bent inwards: and there is pain in the place, and swelling: and the leg that is fractured is stiff
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it, until you are over the fracture in the manner of its figure
If the fracture is only at the extremities of it, then equalize that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from an equal, until its figure is assimilated to its natural form
If the fracture is along the length, or if it is already bending inwards: then make the patient lie upon his belly, until preparation for the restoration of the fracture is complete. When the fracture is equalized, place upon it a dressing: then place upon it a bandage of wood, or of skin: and tighten the bandage more tightly than you fear a displacement of the fracture, neither a removal of the bandage
And equalize the curvature of them with what supports it, until the bandage grasps them according to the equality: and command the patient to rest upon his back, or upon his healthy side.
If, however, a thick swelling should arise: then stop the extension of it, and of its restoration, until the thick swelling has subsided: and place upon it what has subsided, according as before, then return to the restoration of it: and tighten it as needed.
If indeed it occurs in a bone that is sitting, or is broken, extract it.
Concerning the restoration of the fracture of the Surgeon.</start_of_turn>
The aid is that which is between the elbow and the head of the scapula.</start_of_turn
If indeed it is fractured, then the restoration of it is according to one of two methods.</start_of_turn
One of them is: take a flat piece of wood of middle thickness, according to this shape.</start_of_turn
And bind in two extremities two ligatures.</start_of_turn
Then suspend from a high place: and let the patient sit down.</start_of_turn Then he throws his arm over the fractured limb until it reaches its elbow, where there is a swelling of the bone.
Then he hangs something heavy from above, so as to extend the limb downwards. Then the doctor grasps the fracture with his hands simultaneously, until the fracture is set, as required
Another way is that the patient should lie on his side: and he should suspend his arm from the collarbone with the ligament. Then command two assistants, that one should hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other should hold the lower part, and extend each one to his part
Or if necessary, so that the extension may be stronger, then bind under the fracture with a ligament and above with another ligament: and extend both of them to their two parts
If the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is necessary to put on one ligament under the elbow and another under the fracture over the elbow
In the same way if the fracture is close to the forearm: then it is necessary to put on a ligament above the place and another on the forearm itself.
Then equalize the fracture without work, until the fracture is set according to what is required, and apply a good dressing: then bind it, if it does not happen spontaneously
If indeed spontaneous swelling occurs, then loosen the binding until the seventh day. And put on above it a soaked bandage in vinegar and salt, until the swelling subsides: then bind it. And the way to bind it is that you put on a dressing over the fracture.
Then place a new patch over the wound. Then take hold of the arm above the aid and open your hand over your shoulder
Place a bandage and bind the arm above the aid, so that the arm rests in the place of the fractures: if nothing hinders you from that, do not alter anything above or below the fracture.
If anything alters above or below the fractured bone, then use a larger and stronger bandage than the others Place between every bandage the width of a finger: and let the length of the bandages be equal to the fracture plus three fingers from all sides
Then bind tightly over the bandages as I said at the beginning of this chapter.
It should be tighter in the area of the fracture The longer the fracture, the tighter the binding should be
If therefore you have applied the bandage and the binding, as we have said, when you restore the limb immediately, then do this: and if you notice swelling, then loosen the binding and the bandages until the seventh day, as we have said
Then consider the ligament in all three days, so that it does not cause itching, swelling, or hinder the food from passing to the limb, because of the arrangement of the excessive binding Correct this immediately, as we have said
If you are confident that nothing has happened: do not loosen the ligament, except after three days or more
Let the patient rest with their head on their chest, and their hand on their stomach: and put under the aid a cushion filled with an even layer of wool
Consider at all times of night and day that the figure of a fractured limb must not be allowed to become loose, nor must the ligament be softened. The limb must be promptly and thoroughly bound up for your protection
And provide food for the patient in accordance with what has been prescribed, so that the food is soft at first, until the limb begins to mend: then it is necessary to make the food more substantial.</start_of_turn>
As for the attendants and the patient, it is necessary that they should abstain from sexual intercourse for forty days: then it is necessary to loosen it [the bandage], to apply a poultice, and to administer unguents which will repair it.</start_of_turn>
If the fracture is dirty or rough: then do not loosen the ligament or the bones until the fiftieth day, and until two months.</start_of_turn
On the restoration of a fracture of the arm.</start_of_turn>
The arm is composed of two bones, which are named the ulna and the radius.</start_of_turn
One of them is the forearm: and that which follows the thumb.</start_of_turn And the other is the forearm, and that which is placed under the forearm from the lower part.</start_of_turn
Perhaps therefore the larger bone is fractured alone, or the forearm: or perhaps both together.</start_of_turn
When therefore the upper bone of the forearm is fractured, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is more easy.</start_of_turn
And when the lower bone is fractured, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.</start_of_turn
And it is worse when two bones are fractured together.
If, however, the fractured bone is only slightly above the socket, then the physician must join it together again, so as to restore the limb to its natural position, with ease, until it has regained its strength.
If, on the other hand, the fractured bone is large: then it is necessary to set a stronger ligature around it.</start_of_turn>
It is also necessary to restore the limb to its natural shape and to maintain its extension above the knuckles.</start_of_turn> The thumb should be placed above the other fingers, and the lower joint should be set so that all the fingers, or the remaining ones, are in a straight line. The limb should be stable and should not incur any further damage.</start_of_turn
Then the minister should extend the limb from the lower part, or with the hand itself, or with a ligature.</start_of_turn> And the other minister should extend it in the same way.</start_of_turn
And the physician should keep the bone aligned until it has regained its natural shape as much as possible.</start_of_turn>
If there are fragments of bone in the fracture, then attempt to reduce them to their proper place without causing further damage.</start_of_turn
If, however, there is exposed bone that has pierced the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find above it, and remove it in the manner described above.</start_of_turn
If, however, the fracture is with a wound, I will make a separate incision for it, so that I can take care of the cure from that point on.</start_of_turn
If in the beginning of your restoration the heel is stiff, then draw a line from the nail to the tip of the toe made from oleoresinous resin, ivory white, and be midway between thickness and fineness: and bind the nail above the most delicate tension until the heel settles down: then move the callous and place a prepared plaster from the coarse particles of pounded barley with albumin. Then place sponges, and let the sponge which is placed over the fracture be wider and stronger on the wider side
And know that the number of sponges of the Brachium is six in various positions: if the fracture is in one compartment, or in two compartments simultaneously.
Then place your bandage over the fracture more firmly and tightly, and somewhat more with the bandage towards the upper part of the fracture, or towards the lower part of it: or place a softer bandage with the lesser tension alongside the previous one, according as the recollection of it is in the beginning of the chapter.
And let there be cloths which cover the fracture, soft cloths, moist: and not hard, rough ones. And let the thread which is used to bind be of linen, medium between fine and coarse, as we have said.
And consider the limb and the ligament after days. If anything happens whose rectification is necessary, such as itching which occurs to the limb: then it is necessary to bathe the limb with warm water, until the itching subsides, and then loosen the limb, until it rests, and then repeat the bandage.
If the bandage is now softened, and the bone is now removed, and things are like these: then rectify all this with your skill, and consider again.
For if the nourishment is hindered from reaching the limb, because of the excess of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it somewhat, and remove it for a few days, until the nourishment reaches it again, and then bind it again
If, however, no relief has occurred to the sick person anything of what we have said, then it is not necessary to solve the matter, except after twenty days, or thereabouts.
The treatment of the sick person is suspended until his condition improves or after twenty days, or thereabouts. His condition should be allowed to stabilize, and he should be protected from disturbing factors. Let him sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture will be healed in thirty days, or perhaps in thirty-two days; and possibly in eighty days All this is in accordance with the laws of complexion and the laws of virtue.
Section on the Restoration of Fractures of the Hand
Know that fractures of the bones of the hand and the joints of the fingers are rare.</start_of_turn> They only occur with great pressure.</start_of_turn
When such a fracture occurs, or a violent pressure: then it is necessary that the sick person sits upright: and let his seat be at an equal distance from him.</start_of_turn Then place his hand on his extended palm.</start_of_turn
Then extend the fractured bones, and let the doctor keep them even until they are reunited in a good union.</start_of_turn
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, if the swelling does not subside.</start_of_turn Then put a support over the place according to the quantity of the place: and cover the hand with a bandage.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is towards the lower part of the limb, round off the edge of the cloth: and command the patient to keep the fractured part pressed against the limb itself: and then bind it with a long cloth.
And let there be a pad of leather, soft as the hand, which shall be applied to the skin with the limb: and bind the limb firmly, as seems necessary
If the fracture is outwards, then it is necessary to place a pad above and a pad below the limb: and keep the hand open and straight. Then put on a bandage, as it is turned over: and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
If the fracture happen to any of the joints of the fingers, if it is the thumb, make it equal as seems necessary.</start_of_turn> And bind it with the limb: and if you see that it is swelling, put upon it a straight pad, thick: so as to elevate the fracture and that it does not move.
If the fracture is of the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or the ring and little finger, make it equal, and bind it with the healthy finger which follows it: or bind them all according to their continuation: and that is better. Or put upon it a thick pad above all these things as we said concerning the thumb.</start_of_turn>
Consider in restoring him and after the position of the aftercare: and oppose with it what is necessary, when anything happens from this, according to the return of its account.</start_of_turn>
Of the restoration of the fracture of the thigh.</start_of_turn>
The bone of the hip is fractured in many places, and is declared to the sense: because it turns towards the inner and outer parts.
Its restoration is done in this way, because it is bound by a ligament above the fracture and a ligament below the fracture. And the limb is restored to its place over its face
Then stretch out all the ligaments that serve at its part according to equality: and this when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
If, however, the fracture is close to the root of the hip, then is the ligament towards the hip so that the extension goes up: and the other ligament below the fracture
And thus in the same way if the fracture is close to the knee, then is the ligament close to the knee so that the extension goes downwards
Then the doctor must unite the two bones with his hands, until he has reduced it according to the likeness of its natural figure: and the bone is joined together with a good suture.
Then it is necessary to put on a plaster and a bandage, if it has not already happened to the limb after the fracture If, however, this has happened in that case: then leave it for a few days, until the swelling has subsided, then return to your treatment.
The stricture of it must be such. It must be bound over the fracture with strong material, that is, leather: and two or three times, and remain from that surplus Then bind the thigh, until the heel reaches the root of the knee
And introduce a long thread between the hip and the thigh near the knee downwards, and bring the extremities of the thread from the upper part of both parts. Then rotate over the Knee and Hip which remain from the nourishment.
Then place over the Hip in the place of the fracture its own staples, and place another staple upon the Leg Bone.
Then interlace between Knee and Hip with soft tissues and linens, so as to equal the tension.
Then begin with a strong bind from the middle over the place of the fracture three or four inversions And as much as you lengthen with the ligament from the place of the fracture, let your bind be smaller and softer, and gentler.
Then go to two extremities of the thread which you introduced between the Hip and Knee Tie thus with both three staples which are above. Then stretch with both ends of the thread to the bottom, until you reach the heel of the foot.<start-of-turn> And when you have bound both ends of the staples from the other side: so that the ligament does not be moved from its place.
Then release the bind over it, while it remains, so that it does not cause the limb to break, nor swelling, nor inflation, and the like things.<start-of-turn> For if anything happens from this. Thus do with the solution of it, and correct that which happened from it, as we have said many times before.<start-of_turn>
If indeed on the Bone there is a fragment which projects: then it is necessary, if possible, to remove that.<start-of-turn> And if not, find over that and remove that: and care for that with which it was preceded, until it is healed.<start-of-turn>
When the fracture of the thigh bone is strained, in addition to the stitches which are added, as we mentioned in the aid and arm.
The restoration of the fracture must be such that it does not cause the patient to limp. If only one limb is restored, in addition to the other limb which is applied, then it is necessary that the lame limb should limp always.
You know that the thigh bone is strained in fifty days, or somewhat more, or somewhat less: all this is according to the variations of complexion and the remaining conditions.
Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the knee bone.
You know that the knee bone rarely occurs fractured, but often suffers from multiple abrasions.
If indeed it occurs fractured, then neither a suture nor a split, nor a hole in its parts is to be made This is with a wound and without a wound And the limb should be kept above all in this way
The restoration of it is thus that the disrupted parts be joined together with the digits, until they are united and connected as well as possible with equality and ease, and fabrication
Then place a dressing of flour of barley, or wheat, with albumin or oil: and put on it a round bandage if necessary: and bind it up from above with a suitable strap
Consider all the conditions which we have narrated in the other fractures: thus as the swelling of the limb, and similar things: so that you may counteract all accidents with what is appropriate for it until it is healed
On the restoration of a fractured shinbone.
You know that the shinbone is composed of two bones, of which one is thick and is called the Cruris, and the other is thin and is called the Focile.
And it happens in both kinds of fracture of these bones as it happens in the fracture of both bones of the forearm: and because of this, its restoration is equal, and the operation is one
If both bones are fractured together, the Cruris turns towards all parts
If the thinner bone is fractured, the Cruris turns towards the anterior part
And if the thicker bone is fractured, you will find it below: and it is from this that the parts are not covered by the skin.
Then perform extension, and equalization, and ligation of the ligaments equally.
But you must know that if the fracture of the Cruris is a compound fracture, having many splinters: the extension must be less violent, and more gentle to your alleviation
And in the shinbone there is something more concerning than in the forearm: and it is that when you equal the bones, and have completed all your operation, then take two strips of pine wood which are administered in the making of sandals which are placed under boards: and they are made from palm leaves: and choose those which are of small size, and neither of great size: and let their length be according to the length of the shinbone from the knee to the ankle
And then encase over one-half and two-thirds of the wound with two layers according to its length And put one part of the shinbone from one side, and the other from the other side: and they are from the knee down to the ankle
Then bind two layers of tissue in three places from two extremities and the middle. When the tissues are tightly bound, the knee bends to the right and left, and rests comfortably at a good station.
And thus an anchor is also given from wood according to the length of the leg, and is placed in the knee, to keep it still
And most of all, it is necessary that you do this in a fracture when it is its own bone that is broken
Then consider the knee every day, and study it with great care from its swelling, or from its pain, or from any other sign If anything of this happens to it, then oppose it with what is necessary until it heals, if God wills it.
Of fractures of the bones of the foot and the fingers.
The heel never fractures completely
The bones of the foot sometimes fracture when the fracture is complete, and the fingers also sometimes fracture: and it does not happen except by attrition in various positions.
If the bones of the foot fracture, and you wish to elevate them above the level of the body, then put the patient's foot on the prepared earth, like a walker
Then stand still, and place your foot on that which is to be elevated from these bones: then press down, or put on a shoe: and keep it even, until it returns to its place
Then put on a dressing, and put on a cushion above: and place under the foot a board with two flat heads
Then string the thread with the foot firmly bound, after you have plunged the needle with the thread through the tissues, and the rest as needed.
When three or four days have passed, then dissolve the ligament.</start_of_turn> For indeed you will find the bones equal, whether they are fractured or dislocated.</start_of_turn The operation is like an enema.</start_of_turn
If any fingers are fractured, then restore them, and make them equal as before.</start_of_turn Then put your finger on the splint according to the length of the finger, and let it be wider than before: then put under the foot this board as I have told you, and string the thread firmly.</start_of_turn>
If indeed two, or three, or more bones are fractured, then put on each finger a splint of its own quantity, bound with cloth: and string the board at the lower part of the foot: and let it rest on one head of the board outside the foot, in order to keep the retention good.</start_of_turn
And it is fitting that you should remember that I have told you concerning all the things which relate to the fractures which arise from accidents which I have mentioned: and oppose every accident with what is appropriate.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the fracture of the forearm of a woman, and the bone of the elbow, and the swelling of a man.</start_of_turn
When the forearm of a woman is fractured, then make her sit in a square position.</start_of_turn Then incline the thread towards the part of the back of the same side, and keep it back.</start_of_turn
Then let the obstetrix apply pressure to the vulva with his thumb, until he feels resistance: and let him work in the vulva as if with a sphere.
Then let the woman contract and raise her back gradually. This is how the lip will be extruded, until it reaches the vulva like a sphere, and the fracture returns to its place
Then let him put a cushion over her back When he wishes to mix, he should move the lip with ease, then mix: and reduce it as before, in the manner in which you introduced it at the beginning; then return to his cushion first
Do this for seven days, or thereabouts, for the bone will be restored by itself
And if you wish, take a sponge or something similar, and string it over the opening of the wound, and introduce the sponge entirely into the vulva Then blow air through the tube with force, until the sponge is inflated inside the vulva, and the fracture returns to its place
Then let him do the same with the thumb, and let him rest for a few days, as we have said, until he is healed
And when the fracture of the Pectinis bone of a man or woman has happened, then manage in restoring it, and in this way that we have said concerning the bones of the ankle.
And do not conceal the rectum in its close fractures, which are not much significant, especially for one who has some study or experience
And understand my book well, for the fracture itself signifies to you in many circumstances the way of restoring and straightening oneself: understand therefore.
If the vein is broken when the gut is ruptured, grasp the gut and insert the vein into it. Then place over it an outer dressing of cloth, and bind it, and let it remain for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills it.
As for the restoration of a fractured bone when there is an wound.
It is suitable for him upon whom such an accident has happened, especially if it is great, such as the thigh bone, or the collarbone, or the like of them, to immediately perform a bloodletting: if you testify to the condition of the bloodletting, such as we have said before
If blood flows from the wound, then it is necessary to perform an excision of it, that is to say to cut off the surrounding tissue: if there is nothing else present besides this
Then commence to restore the fracture on that very day: and do not delay it, if it does not happen spontaneously.
If indeed spontaneous union occurs, then defer the restoration until the ninth day, until the spontaneous union has taken place And do not approach it on the third or fourth day, for you will make him suffer other accidents
If however the fractured bone is prominent above the skin detected: then it is necessary to reduce it and bring it level with your hands with ease and slight extension
If it is not prepared for extension, and its equalization with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is equal to the quantity of seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the quantity of the wound And therefore it is necessary for the physician to take from the patient three or four according to the quantity required for the cure of every kind of fracture.
And let it be rounded: neither too great nor too small, so that it does not be doubled upon compression in the hour of operation: and let the acute extremities be such as to have a margin in their extremities themselves And let the upper be to the greatness of the middle even unto the lower parts.
This is its form.
It is necessary in the operation that the acute extremity be bent over the protruding part of the bone: and that it be pressed with oil until the bone returns and is equal to the square of the equality
To strive therefore to make the extremities of the fracture equal to each other from below.
And if the extremities are slightly fractured and do not grasp the good instrument, then it is possible that one must cut off the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over it
And if indeed it is not possible to reduce them as we have narrated throughout, then cut it off with the scissors which we have mentioned: or bind it with one of the bands in any way possible to him
And then remain that part of the bone which remains rough with small asperities and cortices.
When therefore the bone has been reduced, and when it has been found to have sustained an injury after reduction, you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Do this thing. For you confer great pain upon the patient when you complete the restoration of the limb as you do the bone
Then immerse the sponge in strong vinegar, black. And if in summer. And do not put upon the wound a greasy ointment, nor anything containing oil: lest it cause the wound to become infected and corrupted.
Then apply sponges at the end of your treatment to restore the bone. And remove the wound: thus, you will cut with scissors a hole in the swelling according to the extent of the wound
And take heed, do not tighten the wound with the fracture. Many have done this carelessly, and have caused great harm to their patients: either death, or corruption, or decay, that is, harm And let your treatment be gentle, lenient, diverse in the strictures of the remaining fractures
If the wound is bad, or is large, and you fear some harmful event which we have mentioned, and you find pain in the suspended part: then do not put sponges upon it And make incisions from strong leather patches in the place of the sponges, and tighten it with the leather
When however a day or two has passed, and the wound has begun to secrete pus: then remove the sponge which you placed upon it with the vinegar. Then apply unguents and ointments which are customary with us to heal the wound: such as the ointment of tetrapharmacon, and the like of it.
And it is expedient to tie off the ligament. And consider the wound every day in the morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed
It is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that the pus may flow downwards easily.
If the wound days pass without consolidation and the pus is not evacuated, you know that there are small bone fragments there Therefore you must inquire about the wound with care How many of these bone fragments are separated from each other? Remove them and extract them. And what is not separated from them, and which penetrate the limb and cause pain, must be cut out, and removed in every way possible.
If there be swelling or infection of the wound, that is, inflammation, or other corruption and decomposition: then it is necessary that you oppose each one of these things with that which is suitable for its treatment, as has been mentioned in its chapter
And concerning that from which I have spoken, you must have a carefull mind when you break a bone, and it projects over the limb, as for example the thigh bone, and the patellas, and similar bones of the great limbs, that you do not presume its traction, for much harm often comes from that, indeed it is often better to let it go until it has decomposed
Perhaps indeed it will break by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then indeed care for the wound, if you see it: and otherwise let it go
Note: The provided text does not include any information regarding the care of a fractured bone, so I am unable to translate the following sentence.
Many things happen with this Nodation in the estimation of the healing of a fracture Especially concerning the close vicinity of sutures: it causes damage from that figure of the limb. It may perhaps forbid the limb from its natural operation.
Therefore take into consideration, if the knot is firm: administer in it medicines which have styptic properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and the like.
Thus, take from these some or all of them: mix them with wine styptic, or with albumin or with vinegar: and apply them upon the knot in a lump, and bind them over the same good tightening.
And remove the tightening, neither keep it for many days. Then loosen the knot, and do it again, until the knot is released
Or bind over it a layer of lead foil which has been split in the middle. Lead has the property of loosening all that it touches of the members.
If however the knot has already adhered to the stone, and is tightly fixed, and causes great pain: then find above it from the upper part of it, and remove the excess: or cut the knot with some scissors, until it is loosened: and care for the wound until it has healed
Concerning the care when restoring, and when the limb remains delicate after that, do not proceed contrary to its natural constitution.
When restoring a fractured bone, and the limb remains delicate afterwards, weak: then it is not done except for good causes For there are many solutions to the loosening of the ligament and its tightening: either because of the excessive tightening of the ligaments, until it hinders the nourishment of the limb: or because of the excessive amount of superfluous dressing which is not in its proper time: or because of the scarcity of blood in the body of the patient, and the weakening of the same.
And its treatment is to feed the patient and keep his body firm until the blood multiplies in it. And administer a bath. And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Then place pitch upon the limb: so that it attracts plenty of nourishment to it And diligently anoint it with lukewarm water, until nourishment runs, and it returns to its natural shape.
Concerning the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored to their proper position
When the limb has been restored after healing from its fracture, and when the fractured bone is prominent or displaced: then it is necessary to massage the limb in such a way that the limb does not impede its natural action. Therefore it is not necessary to break the limb again for that purpose
And there are many proud doctors and restorers in our land who have done this.
And this operation is dangerous and harmful, leading to death, or great fear, as it is mortal.
But if the fracture and displacement are recent: then it is necessary to anoint it with lukewarm water containing soothing herbs such as elder leaves and the root of chamomile, and honey And make for it a plaster with a soothing plaster, such as gypsum made into a centre
Or take the slime of the elder root, and mix it with chicken fat, or with beeswax: and plaster it on with that
Or take pitch pine resin, and mix it with columbine flour, and other things that physicians call for diminishing consolidation
When the knot is loosened with persistent, ancient, and gentle friction, like that done with moist hands. The limb is moved in all parts at all times.</start_of_turn>
If, however, the swelling has preceded the pain, and has become strong, and has been converted into a stone, and has been driven out, necessity demands that it should be treated with iron: then it is necessary to cut above the swelling, to dissolve the continuation of the bone, and to remove what is superfluous from the knot or bone with fine scissors: and to apply ease in that place with care and attention.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the dislocation.</start_of_turn
Dislocation is the displacement of any articulation from its place.</start_of_turn Because it hinders its movement and deforms the limb.</start_of_turn And causes the emergence of excessive pain and wounds that are harmful.</start_of_turn
When, therefore, such a dislocation has occurred, it is necessary to expedite its restoration: neither should it be delayed at all.</start_of_turn
For if it is delayed, the place is left paralyzed, and perhaps with this the reduction of the dislocation is lost.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is not permitted to move or extend it in the hour following its displacement.</start_of_turn Because it causes many spasms and painful pains.</start_of_turn
But when it has occurred, it is necessary to order a bloodletting of the patient.</start_of_turn Then it is dismissed until the swelling subsides.
Then the limb is bound with warm water and oil Then it is reduced with ease
And all the limb is cared for so that its memory returns to its place.
I command that the head of the dislocation be set, even if it has happened in a fracture, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part of it
Concerning the care of the dislocation of the lower jaw
The two mandibles rarely dislocate except rarely
And the dislocation of both is done according to one of two methods. Or else they are removed from their places with a small movement, and they are softened lightly Or they are dislocated completely, without reduction, until they are softened to the breast, until the wound has healed, and it cannot hold together its own fragments, and it cannot close its own opening, and the tongue is involved with the speech
When the dislocation is small, then it returns by itself in various positions with little effort
If however the dislocation is complete, whole: then it must be immediately reduced, and it must not be delayed: and it is necessary that the head of the sufferer should remain still: and the doctor should insert his thumb of his hand into the root of the dislocation of the mandible between the bones of the dislocation, if the dislocation has happened from one side Or he should insert two fingers of his hand together, if the dislocation has happened from two sides And the rest of the fingers of his hand are outside, where they are equal.
And command the patient to loosen his teeth and bite down on all parts The physician must equal the jaw and push it, until it returns to its place
If it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both jaws are together: then give them a wet evaporation with warm water, and oil, until it is easy to reduce both of them: do not reduce them both at once, as we said
When they have returned and are equal, and the patient's jaw is closed, do not massage them: then place over their teeth little plugs of lead, with beeswax that has been made from wax: and oil of roses.
And it is bound with ease with soft bands.
And the patient should sleep on his back: and his head should be placed between two cushions, so that it does not move to the right or left: and do not force him, or make him chew anything: rather give him soft food to swallow, until when he moves his pain has subsided, and the jaw has returned to its place: then he may eat what he wants, and that should be given to him with ease
Do not work over the operation of his mouth during eating and drinking, and biting, until the jaw has settled and healed.
If it is difficult to reduce both jaws when they are displaced at some time, and they do not return to their places: then many times an accident of fever and bitter soda occurs: and perhaps it will be solved by the patient's vomiting, or perhaps by vomiting pure bile
When you have done this: then you know that it is lost, and many people die from this within ten days.
On the reduction of dislocations of the Furcula and the extremities of the humerus.
The Furcula does not dislocate from the inside outwards, because of its continuation with the sternum. It dislocates sometimes outwards: and this is declared by the sense.
And its restoration is that the patient should lie upon his back and extend his arms Then cover the place with your palm, for it will itself return
Then put upon it a pad and some wool, and bind it firmly
The extremities of the humerus which follow the elbow, and continue with it, do not dislocate, except rarely If they dislocate on some other day: then it is necessary to reduce it and restore it according to what has been said, and to prepare the limb for it.
Then put upon it a pad and some wool, and bind it firmly And command the patient to adhere to tranquility and quiet, until he is healed
And when the limb of the humerus has been thus reduced, when it is separated from its place also
Chapter XXVI
Know that the humerus does not dislocate except in three ways.
One of them is that it dislocates to the lower part of the elbow The second is that it dislocates to the part of the sternum. And perhaps it will be displaced to the upper part of the Humerus: and that happens rarely.
And it does not move to the back, because of the swelling And it does not move to the front, because of the nerves.
And most frequently it is displaced and comes down to the lower part towards the armpit: especially in those where the flesh is little Since it comes out quickly and enters quickly
In those where the flesh is much, it is the opposite, that is to say because it comes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty
And perhaps it happens to some people by blow or falling, and the Humerus is displaced by a blow of heat, and it is thought because of this that it is displaced
It is necessary therefore to examine it until you are certain of its displacement, and then you can proceed with its treatment.
It is recognized as displaced when it comes down towards the armpit: and you must distinguish between a displaced Humerus and a healthy Humerus For you will find among them a manifest difference, and you will find in the head of the Humerus a concavity and under the armpit at the touch of the hand as though it were a bone: and it is not possible for the infirm to reduce the hand to its proper position, nor to move it in any way.
Similarly, if it is displaced towards the chest or upwards: then you will find a clear mark, and it is not hidden
And in these displacements there is a simple reduction when it is recent, or when the infirm person is young.
And its reduction is such that the minister raises his hand to the upper parts. Then place your fingers under the edge of his neck, and elevate the wound with a steady hand to its proper place: and the minister raises his hand and extends it upwards. Then place the lower part downwards, and he himself will return quickly.
If, however, he does not return by that which we have said, and has been displaced from the beginning for several days: then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and that an embolus be administered which will soften and soothe, like the decoction of rue, and barley, and meadowsweet in water, and that these be administered
Then the patient is placed lying on his back: and under his neck a sphere and a bandage are placed, which are equal in their degree of softness and tension.
Then the physician places his heel on the sphere, and raises the arm with force, and pulls the patient's hand downwards
And if necessary, reduce it according to this method: and it is that you make the strong hand which is longer than the patient to stand on the side, and to pass under the arm of the patient and bring the arm under the patient's neck: and elevate the patient's neck upwards until he is suspended in the air. And another minister pulls the patient's hand downwards through his belly If, however, the patient is slight: then it is necessary that he be suspended with something else, so that it is supported: for the displacement returns immediately.
And it is also reduced in another way: as when a long stick is planted in the ground, its head being rounded off like a cloak of a murderer: which is neither thick nor thin. Then it is placed under the lower part after the upper part of the stick has been covered with soft cloth: and the lower part remains fixed according to the length of the stick
Then the hand is extended downwards from the other side, and the body is extended from the other side with force: for the suture returns to its place with speed.
If its reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then take care of it thus: take a stick whose length is equal to the distance of two outstretched arms, and whose width is equal to the distance of four fingers, and whose thickness is equal to the distance of two fingers: and let its head be rounded off, so that its entrance into the depth of the wound will be eased, according to this shape
Then bind over the rounded head soft cloth, so that it does not injure the wounded limb.
Then place under the wound the lower part of the limb, so that the hand or arm is extended over the stick down to the lower part: and bind the stick over the support and the arm and the hand.
Then place the arm over the step of the ladder sideways, and extend the hand downwards, and let the rest of the body be suspended from the other side. The suture enters immediately.
When it is thus complete the entrance has been made according to whatever way is possible: then it is necessary to place under the wound a sphere equal in quantity to the wool Then put on a prepared plaster of pounded barley with oil, and albumin on the whole arm, as is usual on the surface
Then string under the rib stricture descends: and the ligament is reversed above the plaster downwards: and its hand is connected to its column, and it is let go, neither hand moves for seven days.
It is necessary that food be given to the patient, until the limb is comfortable: for it is quicker for its healing.
Then, after seven days, or five, it is released when movement is restored. If, however, it remains firm and is not softened, then it is healed.
If, however, the suture is loosened many times, because of humidity which has happened to it, or because of some other cause: then it is necessary that there be applied to it cautery with three holes, according as is prescribed in the chapter on cautery
If this is done entirely, and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the suture is not confirmed, and the plaster and stricture above it are reduced somewhat, and it does not harden, and falls away, and does not rise up again: then you know that the nerves which are at the head of the humerus are either cut, or extended, or softened: and you know that the suture will never take hold in its place.
As for dislocations which happen at the breast and the armpit, or at the back, they are reduced with a push and an extension with the hands: until they return, and the rest of the stricture and care are administered until healing takes place
If after healing there is still greatness in the limb, and tardiness in its movement: then the patient is bathed many times, until the greatness is softened, and it returns to its first nature.
(Text continues with a section on the treatment of dislocations of the elbow.)
Know that the dislocation of the cubital bone is difficult, and returns with difficulty: and it dislocates itself to all parts, and especially to the front or to the back.
And its dislocation is not hidden: because it hangs under the skin and under the touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated And when you join the dislocated cubitum with the healthy one, it is declared to be conspicuous The joining is therefore necessary, and it cannot double the arm, nor touch it with the other arm.
And it is necessary to take care of it promptly, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before swelling sets in
For if swelling should set in, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially when it is at the back For all kinds of dislocations are dangerous, and cause great pain: and they often descend with death.
And the restoration of it when it is possible to reduce it, is that you extend your hand with two hands: and the arm is expanded, and the hands of the physician are above the elbow and below it, and he urges the joining with the thumbs of both hands, or with the root of the palm of his hand, until it returns to its place
Or else the dislocation is to the front: then it returns so that you can double your hand with your hand, until it touches with the root of the palm of your hand the dislocated cubitum.
If it does not obey the dislocation for reduction, then you must administer prolonged extension, strongly: and it is that two assistants extend the arm: and they hold it firmly even, so that it does not move during the extension
Then the arm is returned to its entirety after it has been included over the hand with a doubled long panus or a wide ligament.
And when the physician grasps the hand with his grasp, he should anoint it with oil: so that it may be from the things that aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease Then he drives the grasp forward with an urging movement until it returns
And after its reduction, it is necessary to place over it a dressing in which there is styptic material, and drying with alum: and it should be bound securely. And the arm is suspended from the neck of the patient: and it is allowed to rest for a few days.
Then it is healed If, however, the grasp remains fixed in its place, then the ligament is loosened from it and it is allowed to rest.
And if the grasp is not properly bound, then repeat the dressing and the ligament and allow it to rest for a few days until it is bound securely. Then it is healed.
If, however, there is a degree of severity after the reduction of the grasp, and the position is in motion: then administer moistness in the bath, and gentle friction, and compression, until the swelling subsides, or place over the grasp a compress, that is, the wool of a sheep's fleece Then it is bound, and it is allowed to rest day and night Then take away the bandage, and put it into a bath When it is wet, then gently massage the grasp with temperate friction Then again, repeat over the belly of the patient once, twice, and thrice with the bath inside, until it is softened.
And if desired, place upon the belly of the patient a soft cushion of wool, moistened with butter, and bind over it.</start_of_turn>
Do this often.</start_of_turn> The body itself will soften, and will return to its normal state.</start_of_turn>
(End of excerpt)</start_of_turn>
The limb of Mahassem is often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.</start_of_turn
And its reduction is easy.</start_of_turn Unlike other joints.</start_of_turn Indeed, it is necessary that speed be in the reduction of its dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before it has cooled down.</start_of_turn
And the reduction of the dislocation is like this: place the lower arm of Mahassem upon a board, and extend the hand: and the doctor places his palm upon the prominence of the joint and urges it until it returns.</start_of_turn
Indeed, it is necessary to consider, if the palm has receded towards the elbow: then the patient places the back of his hand on the board at the extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is proceeding towards the elbow, then the position of the hand is inside the board, that is, the inner part of the hand is placed upon the board, so that the hand of the doctor rests upon the prominence of the joint.</start_of_turn
If he returns immediately, it is good; but if not, then bind him with packing around the swelling while it is still soft: and let it go, and do not touch it again.
If he does not tolerate it, neither will a forced reduction be of any avail after a few days: for truly the ligature will remain as before according to the hardness of the swelling. And it does no harm to the patient anything, except that the hand is softened, and nothing can be bound. Then you know that the nerves are severed, or torn away.
There is no skill in this, except to bind it with cautery near the base of the swelling. And perhaps it will do no harm at all.
When the soul does not return, then place over it the packing which we mentioned. And then bind it and let it go for five days: afterwards dissolve it and let it go, and exercise the hand.
If however its motion is hindered, and something heavy has occurred in it: then soften it with warm water and gentle friction, until it is softened
(Continuation of previous sentence): until it is softened
When the Digit is dislocated from its place to any part, or from the palm of the hand to the dorsum, or from the bones of the hand: then extend the Digit and drive back the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns
And then support the head of the Digit, and suspend it over the part from which it is dislocated, and let it go in two days.
And then suspend it, and extend it, until it is perfectly straight on that day.
When the night is advanced, bind the limb according to the account given: and do not cease to resolve it daily: and exercise it with movement: and bind it in the night.
Repeat this daily until it is healed.
Do the same with the hand if it is dislocated towards the palm: bind it to the same part and perform the operation as before until it heals.
Do the same in the case of dislocation towards the other parts
Concerning the cure of dislocation of the shoulder blade.
When anyone has suffered dislocation of the shoulder blade, or complete dislocation of the collarbone, or has displaced many vertebrae from their places: then it is not necessary in such a case to perform any cure, because the moisture is enough for the sick person
And the sign of this is that the patient is driven out without his will, and cannot keep his limbs: and they soften many parts of his body, or two arms or two legs, or one of his members: or displaces one vertebra from its place
For many cause many displacements, because many are displaced towards four parts.
The displacement towards the back is called Gibbositas
The cure in this case is, if the Gibbositas has happened from infancy: then no cure is necessary, neither is there any complete recovery from it
But in these cases, which happen from blow or similar things, as the ancients have said in a long discourse about the methods of treatment Most of them do not return when they are perfected
I have indeed abbreviated it because its explanation is not appropriate in relation to my proximity to the matter: and the exposition which I have given of it, and the formation of its instrument in a different manner from that which they have shown, and the exposition of itself.
Therefore I say, that in the swelling which arises from the front part, there is neither wit nor healing to be found
Similarly in that which happens on both sides also
And it is not cured except for that which happens in its own back, as I have said: and that is, that the patient should extend himself over his face over a level platform near the wall: and let the moisture expand under that, so that the chest is not injured
Then put a fixed stool of wood in the fire in the ground, at the foot of the bed, round about the head: and another stool of wood round about the feet at the other foot of the bed: and let the attendant hold the stool, and let it not be fixed in the fire. And let the other attendant hold the other.
Then put on the head of the patient, and under his chin a soft ligament, firm: and stretch out the extremity of the ligament to the wood which is at his head: and bind it in that place
Then string another ligament above his shoulders and above his knees and at his buttocks. And then gather up all the ligaments and bind them in the other wood which is at his feet
And let all the attendants extend themselves to the part of the limb of the ligaments, and do not move the two woods from their places where they are fixed: indeed they are not fixed, as we said.
And the physician lays his hands upon the Spondilem with force, until it returns: or lays them upon a board. And then he fixes his feet upon the board, until it returns.
If it does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms long.</start_of_turn> And hold it in the wall where we said it is close to the patient, in the place where the extremity of the board enters.</start_of_turn> And then place the middle of the board upon the Spondilem.</start_of_turn> And the physician lays his feet upon the other extremity.</start_of_turn And bind it well, until the Spondilem is firm, and returns to its place.</start_of_turn>
And if you wish, work with the ankle which is included with your hand: and it is that you put two boards, each as long as an arm, under the foot at the back of the patient, and under the head of it two boards.</start_of_turn
And let the length which is between all the boards be one palm: and it is finished in every place where there is a hole through which the ankle turns: and fix all the boards firmly to the ground, so that nothing moves.</start_of_turn
And put in a round board: and it is the ankle which revolves in two holes of the two boards.</start_of_turn
And at its extremity is a hole in which the bone is fixed, which is as long as a palm with that which revolves: and in two other boards it is like that.</start_of_turn
And string the ligaments which you bound in the chest of the patient around the ankle which is at his head: and the ligaments which you bound in the thighs of the patient around the ankles which are at his feet.</start_of_turn
Then the minister shall remain at every turn, who shall twist his hand with the linen, with which the turn is reversed: and the physician shall equal the Spondilem, as we have said.
This is the form of the turn which follows.
Then when Spondilis returns and the place is equal, then it is necessary to place the soaked sponges with albumin or oil Then the sponge. Then place above the sponge a star of table, whose width is three fingers, or somewhat less And its length is the quantity which will cover the place of Gibbositatis, and over the sound part of Spondilis
Then it is bound with the ligation which we have said And the patient is kept nourished with delicate food until he is healed
And if anything remains prominent in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines which soften and soothe, along with the administration of the tablet which we mentioned in the long term And they are administered on that lamina of lead.
And when it happens that there is prominence at the last Spondilium of the back: and it is thought to be dislocation, and that is the bone which is now prominent Therefore it is not necessary to assume that for this reason: for perhaps it will happen that death will happen from this medicine.
¶ On the treatment of a dislocated Anchae.
Know that the ligatures of the Anchae and of the humerus do not happen except for dislocation: and that this does not happen except for a slight displacement and a concavity.
The suture is loosened from the Anchae according to four parts. The suture is loosened from the Anchae according to the front and back parts
The suture is loosened from the Anchae mostly towards the inside: slightly towards the front and slightly towards the back.
The treatment of its dislocation towards the inside is as follows: when you join the limb of the healthy person with the limb of the patient, the latter is longer: and the knee of the patient is more prominent than that of the healthy person, and the patient cannot double up his foot at the ankle: and this is the place which follows the heel after the heel has passed over the knee, because the head of the thigh bone has already gone there.
The sign of its dislocation towards the outside is that these accidents are contrary to these.
The sign of its dislocation towards the front is that it expands the healthy limb according to the complement: indeed it does not double itself without pain at the knee: and if it tries to walk, it cannot do so without going over the front: and it retains its urine, and its heel is elevated, and there is swelling at walking.
The sign of its dislocation towards the back is that it does not expand the knee, and it cannot double itself before it doubles the ankle: and the leg is also shorter than the other: and the ankle is soft, and the head of the thigh bone is at the level of the hip bone
The reduction of this dislocation is indeed of the kind which involves bringing together what has been separated for a long time, which has become old with the possessor of the same thing. Then if you perform the reduction and it remains according to its position: then there is no remaining cure in this matter It is not right that an assumption should be made of him.
However, in the case of dislocation whose displacement is slight, and which belongs to the class of four dislocations, then proceed as follows: grasp firmly and extend the dislocation inwards and outwards, and move the displaced limb from side to side: often the dislocation will return by itself and no further treatment will be necessary.
If it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant, and to extend the limb from its lower part: either with the hands alone or with a ligature which is bound above the knee: and another assistant should extend the hand above, so that the hand is introduced under the toes. Then bind with a soft ligature over the root of the thigh, and hold the extremity of the other ligament.
The extension should be from the anterior part of the groin to the part of the pelvis, or from the posterior part to the part of the back.
And let the extension be uniform throughout, until the patient is lifted up with his body from the ground, and remains hanging down
And this is a common kind of extension among the four kinds.
If the dislocation returns in this way, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary in every case to use the proper treatment.
In reducing it, however, when the dislocation is inwards, it is necessary to support the sound limb over its lateral surface. Then bind the ligament over the root of the thigh, at the place between the head of the thigh and the groin And extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the pelvis
Then another strong arm shall take hold of the arm, and shall diminish the great place of the lower coxae, and shall extend outwards to the outer limit. And then it returns to its place.
This is the easier kind of treatment for this limb.
If, however, he excuses himself from thee, and does not obey thy order with this kind of treatment: then it is necessary that two strong legs be bound along with the strong ligament, over the two ankles, and over the two knees: and let the length of each be as much as four fingers; and let the affected limb be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Then the limb is suspended above the head of the bone which is in the middle: and let its length from the ground be as much as the quantity of two arms
Then command a strong youth to grasp the head of the coxae: and suspend it with the limb together with another: and let another strong youth push forward, grasping the coxae with force, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In its return, however, when there is displacement outwards, it is necessary that the limb lie upon a board, as we have said in the case of a gibbosity. And bind the ligament over the thigh itself, and over the breastbone
Then two boards are placed, one at the foot and the other at the head of the limb. Then a board is placed added in the middle of the foot, fixed well: over which are placed wet cloths, so that it does not hurt the limb: and let the board be between the thighs, so that it does not draw towards the lower parts at the extension.
Then let every minister extend to his own part, and the doctor will equal the reduction of his hand.
If anyone obeys towards reversion, it will be good.
And if not, place above itself a board, and press it down, as we said in the swelling, equally. It is true that the patient should lie upon his sound side.
And when the dislocation is forward, then it is necessary that the limb of the patient be extended quickly: and it is in accordance with this narration that the doctor places his right palm of his hand upon the groin of the patient Then tighten it with the other limb, and with that tightening place the limb extended downwards to the part of the knee
And if the dislocation is backward: then it is not necessary that the patient be extended downwards, but rather elevated above the earth: indeed it is necessary that he be placed upon a hard object, as it is necessary that it be when it is displaced widely outwards, as we said concerning its lying upon two cushions: and it is upon its face, and the ligaments extended: as we said before
And it is necessary that pressure be administered with a board also over the place from which the joint has gone out of place, when the reduction is completed as it is necessary.
And the sign of its reduction is not hidden to you: and it is that you extend both limbs of the patient: and when you take away these equal, and the patient tightens his limb and expands it without groaning: then you know that the limb has returned, as it is necessary: then join together the two thighs, and place a bandage, and tighten with the thumb: so that it does not move outwards to any part: and the patient should rest quietly for three days, or four.
Then restore the ligament, and the patch, and compare the leg with the other: when you see that they are equal in position, then you know that the dislocation is fixed: therefore the patient is able to walk.
Or if you wish to soften it: then retract it, and apply the patch again, and bind it according to your first bandage: and let it go for three days also.
Then restore it and make it slow in its walking over both sides for a few days, until it is comfortable again.
Concerning dislocations of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways.</start_of_turn> It is displaced outwards, inwards, or downwards, that is, backwards.</start_of_turn
It is not displaced forwards.</start_of_turn
Its sign is that the patient applies his leg to his hip.</start_of_turn But if it does not adhere to the hip: then you know that the knee is dislocated.</start_of_turn
And the restoration of all these kinds of dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he can extend his leg over it, and that you place his heel between his feet.</start_of_turn
Then bind the knee to his palms, and make it straight between your fingers over the knee.</start_of_turn Then apply with your palm two sides of the knee with force.</start_of_turn And another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place.</start_of_turn
And a sign of recovery is that the thigh should adhere to the hip in ease, not laboriously.
Then apply the poultice, and let the thigh adhere to the hip Then bind it together with three or four days, or so. Then make it whole
And let him not walk too much for a few days, until he has recovered
If, however, the thigh remains stiff after the reduction, then administer extension with ligatures, as was mentioned in the treatment of the knee, until it returns
(Continuation of previous translation
The calcaneus sometimes returns spontaneously, and sometimes it is dislocated according to its complement And its dislocation is either inward or outward
And the sign of its dislocation is that the heel is swollen, proceeding to the part towards which it is dislocated
The treatment of its removal is easy: it is to extend it easily with the hands, and to make it equal, until it returns.
But when it is dislocated according to its complement, it is necessary to make the patient sit upright: and hold it firmly with a strong hand from behind the back of his heel, in the middle of it.
Then take hold of it with your right hand from the upper part of his foot, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the level of the ankle
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand Then when the left hand has two fingers.
Then spread out the left hand, and push the heel of the foot with the right hand towards the knee without straining.
Do it twice like we have said.
Then push the heel of the foot towards the knee in the third space, and draw the nail backwards
If therefore it returns to one space, or to two in this way, and you have equated the foot, it is good: and if not, do the operation again above it: for it will return itself
If however it is prohibited to reduce it as we have said: then make the patient lie upon his back on the earth, and fix the heel in the earth firmly, so that it rests between the patient's thighs: and you will have involved the thumb over the wound so that it does not damage the patient.
Then take hold of the patient's heel: afterwards extend the other minister of the foot, either with the hands or with a ligament which is bound over the ankle Then extend all the ministers against the extension of the companion: and the heel will be stable between the two thighs of the patient holding it, so that it does not pull the body downwards towards the extension.
Then the doctor will equal the dislocation with his hands, and the other minister will hold the healthy knee towards the lower parts For the dislocation returns with speed.
When therefore the dislocation returns, and it is declared that the reduction is complete: then apply a compress and bandage, and bind up the wound firmly with ligaments, and bind the foot to the ankle
And it is necessary to beware of nerves, which are above the heel behind, so that there is no ligament above them which is taut and damages them
Then discharge him in two days, or three. If the ligament is softened, bind it up: then discharge him on the third or fourth day. Prohibit the patient from walking for forty days. If he attempts to walk before that space has healed, there is no security that the dislocation will be dissolved, and it will be corrupted, and will not recover afterwards
If there should be a soft swelling: then it is necessary that you apply in its sedation the thing about which we spoke elsewhere in connection with treatment, and embrocation, until it is removed
Concerning the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its treatment.
It is necessary that it be equated that which is dislocated from its place with little extension without laborious work: and this is not difficult, indeed it is easy.
If however the dislocation is in some knot of the ankle of the foot: then it is necessary that the patient sit down and rest his foot on the ground, or on a board: and he should be as if he were walking
Then stand up, and place your foot on that which is opposite to those joints. Then clench your foot with your foot as if with a vice, until it returns, and you will see that it is equal and does not appear in prominence
Then place under the middle of his foot a board which can grasp the whole foot, which has two heads Then bind it up tightly for three days. Then discharge him, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is bound up and secured from reduction
On the kinds of dislocations with wound or fracture.
When anything of this kind happens, and you wish to cure it and restore it, many things follow: many of them are harmful to the cure itself. Therefore, it is not permitted to take over the treatment without being skilled in the art of long-term treatment, merciful, pious, prompt, courageous, and not arrogant: and to be subservient to the advice of physicians who sit at the foot of the bed only for warmth. And let him be dismissed from the sickbed with the judge's leave. Except that you think, or hope, that the cure will be found in the softening of the pain, and in what appears to be something hopeful. Try to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the case, before the swelling becomes cold
If the limb returns, as we wish, then administer a regimen that will settle the swelling: and care for the wound with what is suitable for it from desiccant unguents.
If the dislocation is with a fracture, and they are separated from each other in the bone, then try to remove them, and do what we said concerning simple pains in those places
And be careful according to your virtue, and protect yourself from the entrance of fear: according to what has been said before to you
For it is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more beneficial for your body in your time.
