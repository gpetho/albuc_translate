On the incision of the Arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When a person suffers from cataracts affecting the eyes or chest, and it becomes chronic, and medical treatment does not help: then the ultimate treatment is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, the patient must shave his head.
Then rub the area with a rough cloth, so that the arteries become visible.
Then the patient should bind his neck with any cloth he has.
Then observe where the vein pulses.
And the locations of each are the depressed areas behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in certain people.
Then mark both with ink: and incise each one with a spatula sharpened on both sides, cutting down to the bone: and let it be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery, and cut it upward with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers joined together.
For when the vein is cut, blood exits in a pulsating flow, which leaps inward with frequent spurting.
But if the artery is not perceptible to the touch, then you must measure from the ear the space of three fingers.
Then mark with ink, and cut down to the bone.
And the amount of blood that should be let out is six ounces, though perhaps you may release more or less of it.
All of this is according to the quantity you perceive from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
Then examine the wound.
Then if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it so that a hot swelling does not occur: then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
