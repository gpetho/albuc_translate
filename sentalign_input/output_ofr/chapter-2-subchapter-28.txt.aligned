Often extra flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus"; so you must hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow; then put on the area ground vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders; and if this flesh returns after the incision, and it often does, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: it will not return after cauterization; and these are the shapes of the instruments for cutting.	There often grows on the gum superfluous flesh which the Ancients call 'epulis'. You should take it up with a hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its root and let the pus or blood flow out. Then put on the place either pounded vitriol or one of the absorbent styptic powders. And if the growth returns after treatment—for they often return—excise a second time and cauterize; it will not come back after cauterization.	0.86883444
