When the body is afflicted with white pustules, which are caused by thick, corrupt materials; at the onset, cauterize each pustule with a thin cautery stick made from myrtle wood, its tip burned; or with long erestology roots; or with a lenticular cautery.	Foul pustules sometimes arise on the body, caused by heavy corrupt frigid matter. When they first appear you should cauterize the head of each one lightly with myrtle wood whose tip has been lighted in the fire; or with the root of the long birthwort; or with the lenticular cautery.	0.8232705
Sometimes, this cautery is used at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner; they are not burned through, and the excess causing them is disrupted, thus they heal.	Sometimes furuncles also are cauterized in the same manner when they first arise; then they get no bigger and the superfluity originating them is dispersed and the patient is cured of them.	0.6839049
However, this should be done after bloodletting.	But before you cauterize these, the patient must be depleted by bleeding.	0.62163293
