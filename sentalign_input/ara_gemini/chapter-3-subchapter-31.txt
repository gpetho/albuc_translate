Chapter thirty-one on the treatment of dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and they are not subject to what happens to other joints of slight displacement and concavity.
And the hip joint dislocates in four ways, that is, it dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward, and it most often dislocates inward, and rarely dislocates forward or backward.
And the sign of its dislocation inward is that if you compare the healthy leg of the patient with the diseased one, it will be longer, and the knee will be more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient will not be able to bend his leg at the groin, and the area next to the groin will be swollen, a clear swelling, because the head of the femur has gone there.
And the sign of that which is subject to dislocation outward is that its symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms.
And the sign of that which is subject to dislocation forward is that he extends his leg completely, except that he cannot bend it without pain being in the knee, and if he intends to walk, he cannot do so forward, and he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when walking, his weight is on his heel.
And the sign of that which is subject to dislocation backward is that he does not extend the knee, and he cannot bend it before he bends the groin, and his leg is also shorter than the other, and the groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly at the position of the loin.
As for the reduction of the types of this dislocation, it is that you look; if the dislocation is old, it has become chronic with its owner, and he has not tried to reduce it, and it has remained in its state, then there is no treatment at all, so you should not deal with it.
As for he whose dislocation is recent, and whatever type it may be of the four ways of dislocation, hasten to twist the joint and extend it inward and outward and move it right and left, perhaps it will return and will not need any other treatment.
If it does not return like this, then you should prepare a strong servant who will extend his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied around his leg above the knee, and another servant will extend him from above by putting his hands under his armpits, then he will tighten a soft bandage on the origin of the thigh, and a third servant will hold the end of the bandage, and his extension will be either from the front from the groin to the collarbone or from the back to the back.
And their extension will all be at once until the patient is raised from the ground with his body and remains suspended.
For this type of extension is a common type for the four types.
If the dislocation returns as we said, otherwise, each type must have the special treatment that I mention.
As for its special reduction if the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on his healthy side, then you place a bandage on the origin of the thigh between the head of the femur and the area under the groin, then you extend the bandage upward from the groin to the upper body to the collarbone, then another strong servant takes with his arms and embraces the thick area of the diseased thigh and extends it outward with a strong pull, then it returns to its place.
And this type is easier than the other types of treatment by which this limb is reduced.
If it is difficult for you and it does not respond to entering with this type of treatment at all, then you should tie the patient's legs together with a strong, soft bandage on the heels and on the knees, and the distance between each one of them should be the length of four fingers, and the diseased leg should be extended more than the other by the length of two fingers.
Then the patient is suspended from the head by a wooden beam that is in the house, and its distance from the ground is the length of two arms, then you order a strong boy to embrace the head of the femur, and another boy will hold onto the patient, and the other boy who is embracing the femur will push strongly, then the joint returns to its place quickly.
As for its special reduction if the dislocation is outward, the patient should lie on the bench according to what we described for the hunchback, and tighten the bandage on his diseased leg especially and on his chest, then two wooden beams are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head, then an additional wooden beam is placed in the middle of the bench, very securely fastened, with a wet cloth wrapped around it so as not to hurt the patient, so that the beam is between his thighs so that he does not be pulled downward during the extension.
Then each servant extends to his side and the physician straightens the hip with his hands.
If it responds to the return, otherwise, place the board on him and compress it as we mentioned in the hunchback, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side.
And if the dislocation is forward, then you should extend the patient's leg at once, while he is in this very description on the bench, and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the diseased groin, then he presses it with the other hand, and with that, the pressure is extended downward to the knee.
And if the dislocation is backward, it should not be extended downward while it is raised from the ground, but it should be placed on something solid, as it should also be if his hip is dislocated outward, according to what we mentioned of his lying on the bench, and he is on his face, and the bandages are tightened as we said before, and the compression with the board should also be used on the place where the joint came out.
When the hip joint returns completely as it should, and the sign of its return will not be hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's legs; if you see them level and the patient grasps and extends the leg without difficulty, then know that the limb has returned as it should. Then, bring the thighs together, apply the bandage, and tighten it with a turban so tightly that the hip does not move to any side, and the patient must remain still for three or four days, then untie the bandage, and compare the leg with the other.
If you see them equal in size, then know that the dislocation has healed, so allow the patient to walk.
And if you see some relaxation in it, then return and bandage it and tighten it according to your first tightening and leave it for three days as well, then untie it and let him walk slowly on it for days until it strengthens well, God willing.
