of a badly healed wound
When the patient cannot bear cutting or opening, which we will discuss in its place, such an illness arises that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When someone develops a fistula, and it is aged and releases pus and corrupted fluids, you should probe it completely with a thin tent, and make sure you know with the tent how deep it is.
Afterward, heat the cautery that resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula according to the depth that the tent has entered, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupted flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the amount needed;
and be careful not to burn the nerves that are there, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and to the intestine, beware of these places, and do not do this except in fleshy areas, and consider that it is not piercing;
Afterward, treat the area until it is healed, and if the place is sealed, and the infected matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed;
and if the infected matter is not removed, know that the place is perforated, and the bone at the bottom is corrupted;
and as with one of those that we will describe in its place.
