On Tooth Extraction and Removal of Fractured Jaw Bones.	On the extraction of roots and of broken pieces of mandible.	0.6800303
If a part of the tooth breaks and remains after extraction, place a poultice with butter on the site for one or two days until it softens. Then, insert a tool, such as an algast or forceps, whose tips resemble the beak of a bird known as the stork. This is the form of the forceps.	When, in extracting a tooth, a broken-off root remains behind, you should apply to the place cotton wool soaked in butter for one or two days to soften it; then insert the tongs or forceps with stork-bill jaws; this is the figure of the forceps.	0.7284863
The tips should have an inner surface like a file or like aliskilfegi (a type of file or rough surface).	The point should be made like a file or rasp on the inside.	0.56540203
If the tooth does not respond and come out with these forceps, then you must carefully work around the root, exposing all surrounding tissue, and insert an instrument known as the “small lever,” which has this form.	If it does not respond to your attempt to extract it with these forceps, you must dig down over the root and remove all the flesh, and then insert the instrument that resembles a small crowbar; this is its figure.	0.71653295
It should have a short, somewhat thick end and should not be too fine, to avoid breaking.	It has a short rather thick extremity, and should not be tempered lest it fracture.	0.8527267
If the root comes out this way, that is ideal. If not, use other tools, which have the following shapes.	If the root comes out, good; if not, get assistance from the other instruments figured here.	0.77050966
The first instrument has a triangular tip with some thickness.	First, with a triangular point, somewhat stout.	0.70470655
Another is a triangular but finer tip.	Another, triangular and slender.	0.7298889
These tools, along with those previously described for tooth scraping, can be of great assistance.	Sometimes also we get help from this forked instrument and beside this, from other instruments and appliances mentioned above under scraping of teeth.	0.53358614
A further helpful tool resembles a large hook with a twisted, triangular tip of substantial thickness to prevent breakage; it should not be too fine.	Sometimes also recourse may be had to this instrument resembling a large hook, figured thus. The hooked extremity is triangular in section, of some thickness lest it break, not tempered.	0.74717736
Know that there are many dental instruments, and countless other tools as well. A skilled practitioner, clever in their craft, often discovers suitable tools themselves based on the needs of the operation and the specific ailments.	You should know that dental instruments are very numerous, as are the other instruments, almost beyond reckoning. And the experienced worker with a knowledge of his craft may devise fresh instruments according as his work on actual cases suggests them to him.	0.79123247
There are some conditions for which the ancients did not provide specific instruments due to the varied nature of such cases.	For there are certain diseases for which the Ancients did not mention any instruments, on account of the variety of them.	0.6926658
If a jaw bone or another bone of the mouth fractures or decays, carefully explore the area with the appropriate instruments and forceps mentioned for root extraction, and use a tool called “gesti,” shaped as follows.	Now if the mandible or one of the bones of the mouth be broken or decayed, explore the site with some instrument that is suitable for it, namely one of the instruments or forceps mentioned for extraction of roots. We also make use of forceps of this form.	0.76788414
The “gesti” should gradually narrow, allowing a firm grip on the bone so it does not slip or move, ensuring complete removal. Then, treat the area with suitable medications.	They are fairly thick, to grip the bone firmly lest it slip before the bone has been got out. Then cicatrize the place with suitable drugs.	0.5839362
If there is minor decay in the bone, scrape away the rot and treat the bone until it heals.	If the bone is only slightly decayed, scrape it clean of its decay and blackness, then dress till healed.	0.72871125
