Chapter forty-three, on incising the larynx due to a swelling occurring inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the larynx, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it, and this is the order of their words.
As for those with angina, they should avoid incising the larynx, as they will not benefit from it because all the vessels and the lungs are diseased.
But for those who have a hot swelling in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no ailment in the trachea, it is necessary to use the incision of the larynx to escape the damage that results from choking.
So, if we want to do that, we should incise the larynx below three or four rings of the trachea, a small horizontal incision between two rings, as much as the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for the incision because it is devoid of flesh and blood vessels are far from it.
If the practitioner is cowardly, he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until, when he reaches the trachea, he avoids the blood vessels if he sees any of them, then he incises the membrane that we described.
The incision of the trachea is indicated by the phlegm that comes out of it with what is pierced and by the interruption of the voice, and you leave the wound open for a while, so when the time in which choking is feared is over, the lips of the skin wound are brought together and stitched alone without the cartilage, then the medicines that grow flesh are used until it heals.
The author of this book said, "The explanation of all these words that we have narrated is only if they see that the patient's throat has been blocked by one of these swellings that they mentioned, and the patient is near death, and his breathing is about to stop, they go to incise the larynx so that the patient can breathe a little through the wound site and be saved from death.
And they were only ordered to leave the wound open until the course of the illness is over, and its course is three days or so, so then they were ordered to suture the wound and treat it until it heals.
And what I witnessed myself is that a servant took a knife and put it to her throat and cut some of the trachea with it, so I was called to treat her, and I found her gurgling like a slaughtered animal, so I uncovered the wound and found the blood that came out of the wound was little, so I knew that she had not cut a vein or a jugular vein, and the air was coming out of the wound, so I proceeded and stitched the wound and treated it until it healed.
And nothing happened to the servant except hoarseness in the voice, nothing more, and she returned after a few days to her best condition, so from this we say that there is no danger in incising the larynx.
