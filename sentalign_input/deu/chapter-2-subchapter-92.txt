On the cutting over worms generated under the skin, known as bovine disease.
This disease is called the "bovine disease" in some lands because it often affects cattle. It is a small worm that grows between the skin and the flesh, traveling throughout the body, moving up and down, and can be felt as it moves from limb to limb until it breaks through the skin and comes out.
Its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just like worms, serpents, and roundworms in the intestines.
It is feared for its malignancy, as when it travels through the body and reaches the head, it can quickly penetrate the eye and destroy it, which happens frequently.
Therefore, when you want to treat and remove it, it can only be done by tracking its movement and feeling it. Then, tightly bind the area above and below it, make an incision over it, and extract it.
If it is deep in the flesh and you cannot find it, use a cautery iron to burn the area until it dies. The main concern is its corruption, which can damage the area as mentioned.
If it reaches the head near the eye, bind the area above the eyebrow tightly, make an incision over it, and extract it. The patient should then cleanse their body with medicines that expel putrid humors and avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
