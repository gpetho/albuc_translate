On Treating Swelling of the Liver by Cauterization.	On incising a tumour of the liver with the cautery.	0.6526201
If an abscess occurs in the liver and you want to know if that swelling is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane, if it is in the flesh of the liver, then the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.	When there is an abscess in the liver and you are anxious to know if the tumour is in the body of the liver or in its capsule: if it is in the substance of the liver, the patient will be suffering from a feeling of heaviness and no very acute pain.	0.8248386
And if it is in the membrane of the liver, there will be severe sharpness with the pain. If you see that it has exhausted the physicians' treatment, then the patient should lie on his back, then mark the swollen area with ink.	But if it is in the capsule of the liver there will be the sharpest intensity of pain and you will see that it has baffled the doctors. Then the patient should lie back on his neck; then mark the place of the swelling with ink.	0.83773386
Then heat the cautery in the fire, which is the cautery that resembles an awl, and this is its image. And cauterize it with it one cauterization until you burn all the skin and reach the membrane with the cautery until all the pus comes out. Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.	Then heat the cautery in the fire, this being the cautery resembling a probe, of this form, and with that make one cauterization till the whole thickness of the skin is burnt through, finishing up at the capsule so that all the purulent matter comes out. Then apply the treatment for wounds.	0.88995224
This type of cautery should not be used except by someone who has long been trained in the art of medicine, and has experienced these diseases repeatedly. Only then can he proceed with such a procedure. Leaving it [untreated] is, in my opinion, better.	This kind of cauterization should not be employed except by one who has a long experience of the medical art and who has frequent practice at dealing with this kind of disease. Then he can undertake this kind of operation. But in my opinion it would be better to pass it by.	0.8503227
