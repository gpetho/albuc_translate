On the Fracture of the Kneecap.
The kneecap rarely experiences a fracture, but it may often suffer a contusion. If it does experience a fracture, it will be either a fissure or fragmentation into pieces.  This may occur with or without a wound.
You determine all of this by touch, and treat it by aligning any separated fragments with your fingers until they are joined and matched as well as alignment, gentleness, and skill allow. Then apply the bandage and, if necessary, a rounded splint over it.
Apply appropriate bandaging over it. Then attend to all the conditions we have described for other fractures, such as hot swelling and the like, by addressing each symptom appropriately until it heals.
