This is an abscess enveloped in an envelope similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient suffers greatly when he walks; and the treatment of this disease is almost as daunting as the one before, and yet we will tell you the procedure for it, according to what the ancients did.	A varix is a twisted tumour resembling a cluster of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles, which makes movement and exercise and walking difficult for the patient. The treatment of this condition is of uncertain outcome, akin to those conditions just spoken of. Nevertheless we must describe the operation for this condition as it was performed by the Ancients.	0.67901915
