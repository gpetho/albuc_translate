When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then cauterize him on the outside above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the joint of a thumb; and make a cautery on the outside of the back, or two if you need to; and let the cautery be key-shaped according to the aforementioned form.	When there occurs in the urinary bladder a weakness and relaxation due to chill and humidities, so that the patient cannot retain his water, sear him once below his navel, on the bladder, where the pubic hair begins; burn him once also on the right side and once on the left side of the navel; and let the distance of the burn from either side be the length of the joint of the thumb. Cauterize him also once on the lower part of the back, or twice if you need. The cautery should be claviform, as described.	0.8353484
