The third chapter on the reduction of the nose if it is broken.
Know that nothing breaks from the nose except its upper two sides together or one of them, because they are bones, because the lower part of it is cartilage and does not break.
But rather, it is subject to bruising, bending, and flattening.
If one of its sides breaks, then you should insert the little finger into the nostril and straighten that fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside until you restore the nose to its natural shape.
And let that be done by you gently, and be careful that your action does not cause the patient pain.
If the fracture is in the top of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, then it should be straightened with the tip of a slightly thick probe.
If the fracture is on both sides, then do the same.
And hasten to set it on the first day of the fracture if possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling subsides.
Then insert into the nostril a wick of linen scraps if the fracture is on one side, or insert two wicks if the fracture is on both sides.
And let the thickness of the wicks be enough to fill the nostril.
Some of the early bone-setters mentioned that the wicks should be moistened with fat and changed every day.
But I do not see that.
Rather, the wicks should be moistened in egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the wicks until the bone is stabilized and the cartilage hardens.
You may insert goose feather tubes in the nose in place of the wicks after wrapping soft rags around them.
This will make their retention for the nasal fracture stronger and so that the patient is not prevented from breathing.
This is not necessary, if you wish, do it, and if you wish, make the wicks.
If a hot swelling occurs in the nose during your work, then dress the nose with cerate or with cotton dipped in vinegar and rose oil or some of the diachylon ointment.
If a hot swelling does not occur, then you should dress it from the outside with semolina flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg white.
Then place a soft bandage on it and do not tie the nose with anything at all.
If the nasal bones are broken into small pieces or shattered, then you should incise over them and remove them with the appropriate instrument.
Then sew the incision and treat it with what heals and closes from the appropriate ointments for that.
If a wound occurs inside the nose, then you should treat it with wicks and use lead tubes until it heals.
