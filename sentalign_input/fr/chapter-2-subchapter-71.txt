Of priapism
Tentigene is an extra flesh added to the natural part, making it very unsightly; some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the treatment. It is necessary to hold the excess of the tentigene with your hand or forceps, and cut it lightly; do not go too deep to avoid bleeding, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed. Another type of flesh grows at the mouth of the womb, filling it, and sometimes it comes out, looking like a tail, which is why the ancients called it "tail disease." It is necessary to cut it as we said for the tentigene, and treat it until it is healed.
