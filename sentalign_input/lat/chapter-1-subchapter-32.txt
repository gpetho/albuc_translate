On the Method of Cauterizing Feet and Legs
Chapter 34.
When swelling occurs in the dropsical person, and yellowish water fills the feet, it is necessary to cauterize the top of the foot, specifically on the area between the little toe and the ring toe. Raise your hand with the cautery tool, do not twist it, and then lift your hand; do not repeat the procedure at all.
This will cause the yellow water to sweat out, and the cautery should be applied as described.
Then, apply two cauteries on each leg. Use the blade-like end of the cautery tool, applying it lengthwise along the leg, one below the knee and the other slightly lower, around the middle of the leg. Apply two cauteries on each thigh. Leave the cautery sites open without treatment for an extended time so that water may exude from them. Afterward, treat the area with the remedies previously mentioned.
