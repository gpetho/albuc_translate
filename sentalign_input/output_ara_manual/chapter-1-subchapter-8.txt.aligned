On cauterizing for forgetfulness.	On cauterization for lethargy due to phlegm.	0.6123295
That which is from phlegm, it is necessary that the ill one first be given the major electuaries and the pills that purify the brain.	First, great electuaries should be given to the patient to drink; and pills to clear the head.	0.71269286
Then his entire head is shaved, and a mustard plaster, written about in the chapter on plasters, is applied to his occiput several times. This is a type of cautery.	Then let his whole head be shaved and apply a mustard plaster to the hinder part as described in the treatise on plasters. That should be applied several times as it is a kind of cauterization; do it in the very way described there.	0.82203746
And do this in the exact order which I have mentioned there. If he is cured by this, then fine. Otherwise, cauterize him three times on the occiput, arranged in a row from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.	If he is cured, well and good; but if not, burn him with three cauterizations on the back of the head, arranging them in a row downward from the upper part of the head to the base of the neck; and make an interval between each pair of one finger's breadth. Then treat as aforesaid.	0.7735405
Make the distance between each cauterization the width of a finger, then treat the cauterization as described previously.  If you want to increase it, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize him in the middle cauterization.	Then treat as aforesaid. If you wish to add to these cauterizations and the patient be fit to bear it, give him a burn in the middle; and if still more, then burn him on the two frontal prominences.	0.6458477
If you want to increase it, cauterize him on the two horns. Then treat him until he recovers.  And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped, in the form which was described previously.	Then dress till healed. Let the cautery be an olivary as described before.	0.50303686
