About the adhesion of the eyelid
When this adhesion happens to many men in such a manner that the upper eyelid is stuck to the white of the eye, and it cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must place the point of a razor under the eyelid and lift it up; and stretch it with pincers until you cut what is sticking with a delicate spatula, which should not be too sharp or too cutting, so that the patient can endure it without the spatula injuring the eye; and make your incision lightly, so that the eyelid returns to its natural shape; and treat the entire adhesion by sometimes applying salt water to the eye, and washing it with fresh water and eyewash; then place a linen tent between the eyelid and the eye, and put wool moistened with egg white on the eye; and after the third day, use eyewash and healing substances until it is healed.
