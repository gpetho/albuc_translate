On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.	On the Treatment of the Dislocation of the Heel.	0.91218615
The ankle is sometimes slightly displaced, sometimes fully dislocated, the dislocation being either internal or external.	The heel sometimes shifts slightly, and sometimes dislocates fully. Its dislocation occurs either inward or outward.	0.90317655
The sign of its dislocation is that you will see the ankle swollen, and projecting on the side to which it is dislocated.	The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding toward the direction in which it is dislocated.	0.9059382
As to the treatment of its displacement, the reduction of it is easy: if it is gently extended with the hands and straightened, it will go back.	The treatment of its slight displacement is an easy reduction: it involves gentle extension with the hands, aligning it until it returns.	0.83090824
As to treatment when it is dislocated completely, you should make the patient sit upright with a strong and sturdy assistant holding him about the middle from behind.	For treating a full dislocation, have the patient sit upright, and a very strong assistant should hold him from behind at the middle of his back.	0.8543219
Then hold the dorsum of the foot with your right hand, and with the left grasp the foot from below about the heel.	Then grasp his foot with your right hand from the top, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the ankle.	0.8531753
Then draw the foot toward you with your right hand, then with the left, twice.	Then pull the foot toward you with your right hand. Then do the same with the left hand twice.	0.9197482
Then extend it with the left hand and thrust the metatarsus with the right hand without violence toward the leg.	Then extend with the left hand, and push the instep of the foot with the right hand toward the leg without strain.	0.83235556
Do this as we have described, twice.	Do this twice, as we described.	0.973662
Then thrust the metatarsus toward the leg a third time while exerting traction at the heel.	Then, on the third time, push the instep of the foot toward the leg, while you pull the ankle.	0.8589558
If it goes back in one or two attempts thus, and you see the foot is straightened, well and good. If not, repeat the operation and it will go back.	If it returns within one or two attempts in this way, and you see the foot aligned, that is good; if not, then repeat the procedure, for it will return.	0.9243448
If you find it impossible to reduce it by what we have said, make the patient lie on his back on the ground and firmly fix in the ground between his thighs a stake wrapped in material so as not to hurt him.	But if the reduction resists with the method we described, then have the patient lie on his back on the ground, and firmly fix a stake in the ground so that it falls between his hips, having already wrapped it in cloth so as not to harm the patient.	0.7984022
Then an assistant should grasp his thigh and another assistant should extend the foot, either manually or with a cord tied round the narrow part of it; the assistants should pull one against another, with the stake upright between the patient's thighs holding him so that his body will not be dragged down with the extension.	Then one assistant should hold his hip, and another assistant should extend the foot, either with his hands or with a band tied around the ankle. Then let each assistant pull against the extension of his counterpart; and let the stake stand between the patientâ€™s hips, holding him so that his body is not drawn downward during the extension.	0.9514393
Then the doctor should straighten out the dislocation with both hands, while another assistant holds down the sound leg; then the dislocation will speedily go back.	Then the physician adjusts the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant holds the healthy leg downward. For the dislocation returns quickly.	0.87786436
Then when the dislocation is reduced and the soundness of the reduction is manifested to you, apply a plaster and packing, bandage firmly and bind the foot downwards.	When the dislocation returns and its proper alignment is evident to you, then apply a plaster and cotton, bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot with a band to the leg.	0.8009018
You will have to be careful of the tendon above the ankle at the back, not to bandage tightly over it so as to injure it.	It is necessary to be cautious regarding the nerves above the heel from the back, to ensure the bandage is not overly tight, which could injure them.	0.8522389
Then leave him for two or three days; and if the binding works loose, tighten it up. Then on the third or fourth day loosen it, but the patient is to abstain from walking for forty days, for if he tries to walk before this lapse of time you cannot be sure that the dislocation will not collapse and corruption set in and thereafter be incurable.	Then leave it undisturbed for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it again; then loosen it on the third or fourth day. Restrict the patient from walking for forty days. If he tries to walk before this time has passed, there is no assurance that the dislocation will not recur and worsen, making it beyond healing.	0.93876916
If an abscess occur you must allay it by the application of such dressings and embrocations as we have already described more than once, until it is gone.	If a hot abscess forms, apply the treatment previously described in another section for cooling the inflammation, and apply embrocation until it is reduced.	0.6013005
