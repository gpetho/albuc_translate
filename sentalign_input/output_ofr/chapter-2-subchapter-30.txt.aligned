It is necessary when you treat a toothache that you delay pulling it as long as you can, for one should not do this; for it is a very important substance until one has no excuse to scrape it.	You should treat toothache with every device and be reluctant to extract; nothing can replace the tooth when it is extracted, for it is a noble substanceâ€”until there is no means of avoiding extraction.	0.71010053
Then when the patient is compelled to have it extracted, you must be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and has the good tooth pulled; and yet the pain does not leave because of that, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this done to these lords; and when you are quite certain of the aching tooth, then you must scrape around the tooth with a strong spatula to protect the gums on all sides; then loosen it with your fingers or with fine tongs at first, little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly grasp it with the tongs; and let the patient's head be in your lap between your knees, and hold him well so that he does not move.	When the patient is determined to have it out, act with deliberation till you are sure which is the painful tooth; for often the pain deceives the patient and he thinks the pain is in a tooth that is sound, so he has that one extracted; but the pain does not abate until the diseased tooth is removed. We have frequently seen this happen in the practice of the barber-surgeons. When you are quite sure which is actually the painful tooth you should cut away all round the tooth with a scalpel having a certain measure of strength, until the gum is separated all round. Then, with your fingers, or with a pair of fine forceps, first move the tooth slowly and gently till you stir it; then get a good grip on it with a pair of large forceps, holding the patient's head between your knees so that it does not move.	0.9172461
Then extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it will not come out, then take one of these instruments and insert it gently on each side, and move it as you did before.	Then draw the tooth straight out so as not to splinter it. And if it will not come out, then take one of these following instruments and gradually introduce it beneath the tooth all round; then try to move it as you did before.	0.85796237
And if the tooth is perforated and decayed, you must fill it with cloth, there where the holes are; and grasp it delicately with the tongs, so that it does not break upon extraction; and it is necessary to work very carefully around the gum to loosen the tooth.	If the tooth has a hole in it or is decayed, you should plug the hole with a rag, forcing it in with the tip of a fine probe so that it will not break when you grip it with the forceps. You must completely scarify all round the gum.	0.7972065
And take good care that you do not break it, and a piece remains, and the patient suffers even greater pain than the first due to the harmful root.	Take the utmost care not to splinter the tooth lest a piece should remain behind and arouse the patient's ills afresh, causing greater pain than before.	0.7075056
The shapes of the instruments, with which one moves the teeth first, should be with long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you pull the tooth; and these are the shapes:	The shape of the fine forceps with which you first move the tooth should be with long jaws and a short handle, thick, lest they bend when you take hold of the tooth. And this is the shape of the large forceps.	0.8301792
And they should be of thick parts so that they do not bend upon pulling, and be of well-made Indian steel, and be toothed to hold firmly.	They should be of Indian iron or of steel, strongly made, the jaws tempered and having teeth fitting into each other so that a sure and firm grip may be obtained. Sometimes the jaws are made like a file, also to give a strong grip.	0.73237246
