About the flesh of the gums
Many times, attached flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus"; you must then hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow; then place ground vitriol on the area, or other constricting and drying powders; and if that flesh returns after the incision, as often happens, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: it will not return after the cautery; and these are the forms of the instruments for cutting.
