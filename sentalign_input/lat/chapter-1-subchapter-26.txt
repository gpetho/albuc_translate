On the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Chapter 28.
When cold and excessive humors occur in the stomach, to the extent that they disrupt its temperament, and phlegm increases, and regular treatments are ineffective, then the patient should be placed on his back, with his legs and arms extended.
Then cauterize with three cauteries: one under the breastbone the size of a single finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on both sides of this cautery, until a triangular shape is formed by the cauteries.
And leave space between each so that they do not merge when they form pus.
Let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
Let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition; and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach in this form, and let the cautery be circular in shape.
The stomach can be cauterized by puncturing for those who fear this cautery: mark a point on the stomach according to the desired size with ink, then cauterize with a pointed cautery, then treat it with the previous remedy until healed.
