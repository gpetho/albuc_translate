Chapter thirteen on the treatment of the fissure that occurs in the upper eyelid.
The eye that is affected by this fissure is called "hare-eye".
And this fissure is either natural or accidental.
The accidental one results from the healing of a wound, a tear, a cauterization, or something similar.
The way to treat it is to incise that healed part and separate its edges and place between them a wick of linen and tie it until it heals.
And it is not appropriate to use in its treatment things that dry and constrict, because if you do that, the fissure will return worse than it was.
Rather, use things that soften, such as fenugreek and poultices with water in which marshmallow and flaxseed have been soaked, and diachylon ointment melted with some oil, and smear the wick with it and treat with it.
And the key to its treatment is to strive by every means that it does not heal in the way it was originally.
And this treatment that we mentioned is only a partial repair of the fissure, not that the appearance of the place returns exactly as it was originally.
