The eighth chapter on the mending of ribs if they are broken.
Know that rib fractures occur only in the thick parts adjacent to the back.
And their front ends are subject to bruising because they are cartilaginous.
Knowing this is not hidden from the senses when examining with the fingers.
Its reduction is by straightening the fracture with the fingers in the most effective way until the shape is as it should be.
Then bandage and tighten the broken bone with a splint if needed.
If the rib fracture is tilted inwards, it causes the patient severe pain and a stabbing sensation like the stabbing that occurs to someone with pleurisy, because the bone stabs the diaphragm.
It also causes him difficulty breathing, coughing, and coughing up a lot of blood, and this is difficult to treat.
The ancients devised many tricks for it.
Some of them said it is necessary to make the patient's food something that generates flatulence and wind so that the abdomen swells and expands and pushes the fracture outwards.
We dislike this lest it confirms the occurrence of a hot swelling if it has not occurred.
If it has occurred, it increases and confirms it.
Some of them said a cupping glass is placed on the area and then sucked strongly, and this is more like the standard, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will attract superfluities to the area because of its weakness.
Some of them said the area should be covered with wool dipped in hot oil, and padding should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandage is level when you wrap it around circularly.
Then treat the patient with the treatment of pleurisy in terms of food and medicine.
If the patient is exhausted by a severe matter that he cannot bear and the bone stabs the diaphragm with a harmful stab, and we fear for the patient, then we should incise the area and expose the broken rib.
Then we put under it the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which has been described previously, and cut the bone gently and take it out.
Then we bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures and treat it with ointments until it heals.
If a hot swelling occurs during that, immediately wet padding in rose oil and place it on the area.
And treat the patient with what soothes the swelling from the inside as well, and he should lie on the side that makes sleep easier for him until he recovers.
