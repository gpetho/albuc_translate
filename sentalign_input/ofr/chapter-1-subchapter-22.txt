of scrofula
When scrofula is caused by phlegm and cold humors, and does not respond to digestion by medicines, then heat the pointed cautery, of which the form follows below, and it should have two openings for the fumes to escape from the cautery on the other side;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days;
and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is gone;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and tents until it is healed.
