of tears
When the tears of the eyes are descending from the vessels that are on top of the head from heat, and the medical treatment applied is not effective, and you see the patient's face redden, and feel a throbbing in the forehead like a tremor; and his eyes are weak and watery so that the hairs of the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are heated and chafed by the burning of the tears, then this treatment is needed.
And the ancients called it "cure contuse," and it is that you shave the hair from the forehead of the patient who has this illness, then make three incisions in the forehead equally along the length of the forehead; and let one of the incisions be about two fingers wide in the middle of the forehead, going down to the nose, and the other two at the sides above the eyelids, and beware of incising the arteries that are on the two sides above the eyelids; and keep your hand away from the juncture of the two mandibles, and let each wound be the width of three fingers joined together across; and have ready a piece of sponge and plenty of cloths to wipe the blood, then insert the pointed spatula on both sides, of which this is the form:
from the incision that is towards the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh that is between the two incisions with the rasp that is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then remove this spatula.
Then insert into the first incision the instrument which is called "cultellaire", and it is very sharp on one side, and on the other side it is smooth, not sharp, and this is its form:
And place the cutting edge towards the raw flesh of the body, and the smooth side towards the bone, and insert it until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous until what is visible of the flesh, and then do the same in the middle incision until the other side; and then draw blood evenly, and squeeze the area because of the collected blood; then put in each incision a tent of old cotton, and put on cloths soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and ensure that no hot abscesses develop; and on the third day untie the bandage, and administer a large amount of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which one treats wounds, until it is healed.
