Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed this book for you, O Sons, which is the last of medical science with its completion and I have finished it in its entirety, after its expositions and its declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Tractate which is part of the operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Because surgery with the hand is in our region and time completely absent, until perhaps the knowledge of it perished, and its trace was cut off: and there remained from it, except for small descriptions in books of ancients, which were altered by hands: and errors and hesitation happened to them, until their intentions were closed, and the power of him was extended: It seemed to me, that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise in it according to the way of exposition, and declaration, and abbreviation: and that I should come with the forms of instruments cautery, and the rest of the instruments of work: when it is done from the addition of declaration, and from the preparation of it which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The cause why a good artificer is not found in our time with his own hand is: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to exercise himself before that in the knowledge of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the attachments of the members, and their forms, and their conjunctions, and separations, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their exits, and the pulsations of veins, both quiet and moving, and the places of their exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of this Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work little, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have now spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For whoever is not learned in what we have said about anatomy, he will not be able to purge himself, but rather fall into error, by which men are slain: just as I have seen many of those who form themselves from this knowledge, and boast of it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	That is, because I saw a foolish physician follow an abscess on the neck of a woman, and he cut into some arteries in her neck; therefore, blood flowed from the woman until she died between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician who dared to extract a stone from a man who had advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	Therefore it came to him, and he extracted it with the fragment of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I indeed had been called to remove it; and I saw from the size of the stone, and the disposition of the patient, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who was receiving a stipend from a certain Duke in our land for medicine: and it happened to an eunuch, black, who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture above the wound with splints, and nails, with a strong bandage, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he completed it according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he dismissed him for some days, and ordered him not to loosen the ligature. And he stood thus until the abscess came to his leg, and his foot, and it came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore summoned to him: and I hurried to loosen the ligament: and tranquility followed, and he was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	Nevertheless, corruption was already confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore when corruption has ceased to wander through the limb until it has perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who lanced a cancerous abscess: and it was ulcerated after days, until the malignancy of it had increased with its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, because when it is a pure cancer from the humor of melancholy, then it is not necessary that it come to it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb which can bear to have the whole thing cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And therefore, sons, it is necessary for you to know that surgery with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, surgery which is accompanied by health; and surgery, with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have now aroused in every place of this book, where there is an operation, a terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you, that you avoid it, and halve it: that they may not find a foolish way to speak, and to dishonor.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, take the measure with care and protection, and your patients with ease and firmness, and use the best way leading by the grace of God to salvation and a praiseworthy succession: and dismiss terrible illnesses difficult to heal: and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon you in your faith and your well-being.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more enduring for your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen indeed said in some of his precepts.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad ailment: so that you are not called a bad physician.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now however this treatise is divided into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Of cautery with fire, and cautery with sharp medicine, a chapter, and ordered from the head to the feet, and the shapes of instruments, and cautery tools: and all that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Of incision and piercing, bloodletting and punction, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things to these: and the whole chapter, arranged according to the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter Three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, and dislocation, and healing of torsion, and similar things:  a chapter arranged from head to foot, and the shapes of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the utility and harm of cautery: and what constitutions it is suitable for, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Head I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before we remember the operation with him, it is necessary that I say the quality of his aids, and his harms: and in what complexion he is shown.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	Therefore I say that discourse on the quality of cautery and its use is a lengthy and subtle science, and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Even many wise men spoke on this subject and disagreed about it; and for my part, I find it enough from their words, fearing an extension.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	Therefore, I say that cauterization is effective universally for every condition, which is with matter and without matter, except for two conditions, which are hot condition without matter and dry condition without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	When the complexion was warm and moist they separated with the material.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some have said that a cautery is helpful in this.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of this, namely that cauterization is not suitable in illness which is from heat and dryness; because nature is heat, and it is unsuitable that it be healed from hot and dry disease with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of this said: that by cauterization healing is done in every ailment hot and dry that happens in the bodies of humans: because when you compare the body of a human and its humidities to the complexion of fire, you find the body of a human cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say by his saying: because from experience already it has shown itself to me many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	Nevertheless, it ought not to come to pass that one should undertake this, unless he has already been tested and trained in the last exercise of the chapter on Cauterization, and has recognized the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and accidents, and the space of time for them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Of the remaining complexions there is no fear: and especially in cold and moist ailments.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For now all physicians have come together on these matters; and they did not disagree concerning the help of cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that from the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine is this: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member that is cauterized; and it does not harm another member joined with it, except with little harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of burning in medicine comes to that which lengthens from the limbs; and perhaps it causes pain in the limb to occur that is difficult to heal, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and goodness of substance, does not do this unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now indeed it has been made known to us by experience, because of the length of service and study with the art, and standing over the truth of things: and for this I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to me in this book of mine, to bring to you the hidden secret by fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of its expulsion, which expels diseases with a philosophical demonstrative discourse, that would agree with your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that they disagree about the time in which cautery should be done, and put forward a better time for truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is fitting at all times; for the harm arising from time is submerged in the benefit which is drawn with cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary pains, strong and urgent, which do not tolerate delay; because it is feared from them that an evil may happen which is greater than a small harm caused by the time passing.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it enter your minds, O sons, that which is not feared by the vulgar and foolish physicians, namely that in illnesses that are healed by cauterization, there is not always a return; and they put forth this as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: because cauterization is not otherwise than medicine, which alters complexion, and dries up the humidities which are the causes, wherefore pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization is superfluous over medicine because of the speed of its health and the power of its operation, and the intensity of its dominion: and it is possible that illness may return after some time according to the constitution of the sick person, and the location of his illness, and the virtue of him, and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in him, and what comes to him in its acquisition from foods, and similar things from causes, unless illness occurs in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Pain that is slight in a limb due to few excesses and moistures, such as the pain of a tooth, because of the pain, and similar to it, for it is possible that the pain does not return there.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that is done in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the common saying that cautery is the last resort of medicine is a true saying: not for what they intend by it; because they believe that it is not a cure that compares with medicine, nor with anything else after the occasion of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The matter is contrary to this, and the intention, that cautery is the last of medicine, is not so, except when we administer modes of treatment in some illnesses, and those medicines do not help; then, at the end of the matter, we administer cautery, and it helps: therefore, it falls that cautery is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that a cautery with gold is better than a cautery with iron: and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold, and the sublimity of its substance: and they said that it does not make pus the place of cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely true; for I have already proven it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And a cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they have said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you heat the cautery with fire from gold, it is not clear to you when it is heating according to the quantity that you want, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches to it coldness, and if you add fire above it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore the artificer comes from that into employment: and for this reason cautery is made with iron among us more quickly and nearer, from rightness to operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I indeed have arranged this Chapter on Cauterization, according to chapters; and I have arranged them from head to foot: so that they may help the one who seeks what he wants from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	On the mode of cauterization of the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This applies cauterization to the domain of moisture and coldness over the brain: which two are causes of inflammation, and multiplicity of flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and multiplicity of sleep, and toothache, and sore throat: and universally all illness, which happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and inflammation, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the sick person: that first it be evacuated with a medicinal solution cleansing the head for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the infirm and his age and his habit require.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command him to make his head shave with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands square, so that he has now placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Whenever therefore your middle finger shall have passed over it, mark that place with an unbleached one.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then cautery with olive oil fire: this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the marked spot with the unfastened, descending part so that your hand may be gradually tightened, and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see already exposed from the bone the quantity of alkiel, or the quantity of zeuherbi, then elevate your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another from itself if it becomes cold: until the bones which I told you appear.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and drink it into the wound, and put it over the place: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place upon it a cloth soaked in butter, and let it remain over the site until the fire's scurf is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment of four drugs, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more it emits pus, and therefore it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone; and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned away.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it is scraped after that which has been burned from bone, then it is cared for.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary that with the cauterizing iron one should arrive at the utmost, until it impresses into the bone a form, so that the bone falls off, which happens as in the shape of a chisel; or an instrument which women put on the small alphabet infusion; and they believe that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it is cared for until it consolidates.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, these two kinds of cautery do not appear at all except in certain people according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to dismiss him, in my opinion, is better for his health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have demonstrated in the other limbs: and especially when the body of a weak patient is naturally debilitated. And indeed the first kind of cauterization is safer and better for me, and I use it; therefore operate with it in safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	On the method of cauterizing the head in pain throughout the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs throughout the whole head: and it continues in the sick person, and he uses pig fat, and ointments, and head purges, and oils, and emplastrum.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and it does not help anything from those: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	If the head of the sick person is strong by nature's creation and not weak, and it finds intense cold, then cauterize with a cautery beneath it a little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it on every horn of his head with a cautery, so that it does not penetrate the skin, and uncover from bone the quantity which we have narrated.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize him with one cautery on the back of his head, in the place which is called "was": and it is a place where a ventouse is placed; and elevate your mattress here, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For he found himself in pain because of this, and it was different from the pain of other cautery burns on all parts of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I shall say this regarding the cautery: and it ought to be a cautery for cauterizing the horns of the head, and the nape of its neck with a finer cautery than that used for cauterizing the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the manner of cauterization in headache, both with a medicinal fire, and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When there is pain and swelling in the head, or pain extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed with purifying medicines, and the rest of the treatment, which I have said in the divisions of diseases, is administered, and this does not benefit at all; then cauterization is done in it according to two modes: either cauterization with a burning sharp medicine; or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	A cautery with a sharp and burning medicine is, to take one tooth of another, and to scrape it, and to cut off the extremities of it from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut a place of pain in time with a wide lancet, until a place is made under the skin, in which the tooth is caught.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore introduce it into the very skin, until it is covered; then bind over it with a little poultice of a decent constriction, and let it be for fifteen hours; then unbind it, and remove the one, and leave the wound for two or three days: afterwards put upon it a pad immersed in butter, until a place produces pus; then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this with certain medicines that burn, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization of it with iron, is according to this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Burning cautery, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called Claulis: because the shape of its head is like the shape of a key, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it over the spot and hold your hand: and you revolve the iron gradually with speed: and let the quantity which is burned be as the thickness of the skin.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift up your hand so that the artery below is not burned and blood does not flow.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak a cloth in salt water, and place it over the location, and leave it for three days; then put the cloth with butter on top: afterwards, care for it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this headache with the second end of the cutting instrument of the cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And be cautious about an incision of the artery in this headache, not one that is old properly.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the manner of cauterizing in ancient headache.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a headache, with that which we said from the previous treatment, and that which we said in the divisions of illnesses, and it does not matter for treatment: and you see from the illness that what we said from the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, is not enough, then it is necessary to use a knife cauterization until it whitens. After which mark signs on the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost that: and put your hand in one vice, and squeeze it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to avoid the continuation of the mandible, which moves during chewing, lest it be burned on one side or the nerve that moves it, whereby spasms occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And let there be care and watchfulness of the flow of blood from the artery that has been severed.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its cutting there is fear, and especially to he who does not know what he does, and is not studious nor experienced: and abandons the operation with him first of all.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I shall come with a remembrance of the regimen of the flow of blood from an artery according to its mode, and in the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see that from illness, the cautery does not suffice for him, and you see the body of the infirm enduring the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, care for the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer a cautery, which we said in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery having two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For indeed cauterization is better this way and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the mode of cauterization for ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and it is treated with decoctions and the rest of the cure that we have said in the division, and the pain does not go away, then cauterize with fire; and this is called a Point, whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the points with it after its ignition on the circumference of the whole ear, as it rotates: or on the circumference of both, if pain is simultaneously in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And elongate yourself with a cautery from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with encaustic; and let the quantity of cautery be ten punctures in every ear, and so forth.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the wounds until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the manner of cauterization in a torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	A torture which is cured with cauterization, is nothing but from kinds which happen from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cauterization of the kind that comes from drying and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of earache with leeches and head washes and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the diseased person with three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little lower from its time, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite part of the weak.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not occur unless in a part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cautery in the direct extremity of the upper earlobe below the corner of the head slightly: and at another time: whose length should be according to the length of the finger.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind from the knife, whose shape is preceded: however, it is not too refined, as you see: and it ought to be a knife in it of superfluous thickness little.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the place, with that which preceded it: until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the mode of cauterization in old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy has aged, and you have treated it with what we said, and your treatment is not effective, and the sick person does not have fever, then cauterize him with four cautery burns on top of every horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said before, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what preceded: and the manner of the cautery let it be according to what preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	It is also cauterized with a cautery over the opening of the stomach: and this is more ultimate.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then it is cared for, with that which preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	On the manner of cauterizing in obliquity.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that in a drink are given first to the infirm large amounts of hyer and purifying pills for the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the head of the sick person entirely, and place on the back of his head a plaster of synan described in the treatise on plasters: and place it repeatedly.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This, indeed, is the manner of cautery, and do it according to the same order which I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore it is healed through that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then make three cauteries on the back of his head, which are descending from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cautery the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then care for cautery, as that which preceded.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If, however, you wish an addition, and the patient is weak and enduring it, then make a cautery in the middle for him.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you want an addition: then cauterize it over two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for him until he heals: let the cautery be olive oil according to the form which has been previously stated.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then scrape the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over every horn of the head, and with a cautery over the back of it, and with three over the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If, however, you need to soften the body in illness with many of these things, and he is weak and enduring, and the illness is strong: then burn him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and the last one with a cautery, until it burns from the skin most of it, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for it until it heals; and so apply the cautery of Albucasis.

Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic is not cauterized, unless his epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore it is necessary that you cleanse the brain of him first with a pigskin, and with the rest of the care which we have said in the division: when he is greatly ill, or is enduring in the acceptance of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If it is a boy who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing chewing are administered to the brain, before that many days with improvement of foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in manner: and with another cautery in the back of his head, and over every horn of his head with a cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If the patient be strong but enduring, then cauterize him with cautery as I said in treating paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back: and let the cauterizing oil be according to the measure which preceded.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of descending humors, and the body of the sick person is humid, then give him in a drink that will purify his brain, according to what preceded in the division; then shave the head of the sick person, and afterwards make a poultice properly made from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head: and the weak one sitting square shall be held from every part.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply this ointment.

Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then order him to shave his head and cauterize it in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize it over the two temples with two cauteries, if there is a beginning of water flow into both eyes at once; or from one side, if there is a beginning of water flow in one eye; and cut off with a cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in the width of the temples; and beware of the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see something from that, then immediately cut it away with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with the wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting, and care from the flow of blood.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are ancient and continuous, and they are above the veins and arteries that are on the head outside, it is verified that this is from the superfluities cold, phlegmatic: then cauterize with the cautery same as I narrated in the beginning of the descending water, the cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you need to add something, then cauterize it on all sides of the eye carefully, above the eyebrow tip with a small cautery.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in every part: and let them be lengthened from the two temples: and let the length of every cautery be according to the lengths of the eyebrow: and do not bring your hand with the cautery to the end, but according to the quantity which is burned the third eyelid.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the manner of cauterizing the eyelid when hairs are inverted and piercing the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	Cauterization is done in two ways: either with fire cautery or with a burning medicine cautery.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	When using cauterization with fire, command the infirm person before it to shave his hair if he is of those who have it trimmed, until they are lengthened and made equal.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If they pierce him at his birth place: then bind his eyes with a piece of cloth, that they may not move until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore they are born and made equal, then put the head of the sick person in your bosom: then mark above the eyelid of his eyes with a cautery, a mark which is according to the figure of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a soaked sponge in the albumen of an egg: or in flaxseed mucilage over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then a fire cautery, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then burn over the figure which you marked out in many lines until the skin surface is burned, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, altogether apparent properly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid already contracting, and hairs being removed at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore raise your hand then: and let him go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then put on top of it a compress with butter until the scab is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If something returns of the hairs after an hour, and the eyelid softens: then repeat the cautery over that place, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If hairs are in the lower part: then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place: and it should be equal so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the way of cauterizing with burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.

Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap and from unsoaked lime, one ounce each; then rub them together well, and make it with haste so that it does not cool.

Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you shall move it whenever the sick man feels the bite of the medicine; because he finds its bite like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore he persevered in this which he himself invented biting, then dismiss medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting has quieted, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid elevate, as it elevates with contraction with fire, or with incision, it is well: and if not, then repeat over it from medicine on the place where the medicine does not imprint, and does not darken, until your operation is equal, and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place upon it a cot with butter until the burned skin is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with diaphanic ointment, or another, until it is healed.

Let it be concave, like the form of a goose feather quill from one end, with which cautery is made; and if you wish, let it be penetrating to the other end, and if you wish, let it be bent upwards.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this is better for your work.

Then immerse it in boiled butter: and place it on the aching tooth quickly, and hold it until it cools: then repeat it several times, until the virtue of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, submerge wool or a cloth in cold butter, and place it over the aching tooth: and place on top of it burning iron until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cauterization of it with fire is, that you may apply to a tube of air, or a tube of iron.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of thickness in his body, so that the sharpness of fire does not reach the bone of the infirm.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then set the cautery to fire, whose form will come: and place it upon that tooth: and hold your hand, until the cautery cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary in the cautery's application, that the sick person fill his mouth with good broth and hold it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of cautery.

Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open ends so that smoke may exit at one end when cauterizing from the other end: and place it lit upon the abscess once, and again, if needed, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the abscess is small: then place cautery according to the size of the abscess.

When an abscess occurs and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic; then if it is in the flesh of the liver, a pain invades the weak patient, and heaviness without sharpness: and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is a pain with very vehement sharpness: and you see now, because it has fatigued his doctors with treatment.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, it is necessary that the sick person lie on his neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the figure of the place of an abscess with cautery; then fires of cauterium which is assimilated to a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it one cautery until the whole skin is burned and it reaches the flesh, until all pus comes out; then care for it with treatment of wounds until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And one should not use this cautery unless the study of medicine is prolonged, and by whose hands these ailments occur with experience many times; then indeed let him dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But in my opinion, it is better to dismiss her.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterization in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that a cautery with the roots of asarabacca is used for cold pleurisy in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you receive from the roots of dried long birthwort, one root longer, which is found in it, and let it be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil and set it aflame.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then burn with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the fork and the neck, and with two small cauteries under a slight slant towards the part which is below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth rib sloping to the rear a little: and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from behind: one where it is between two spatulas: and two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, lower cautery which is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you must not grasp your hand with the cautery, but rather it should be on manifest skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancients said that there are men who use a cauterio from iron similar to a rod: and they ignite it, and put it inside where is between the ribs, until it comes with it to the abscess itself, and pus emerges: as we said in the case of an abscess of the Liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear, that either the weak man dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in its place, which has no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Of the mode of cauterizing the spleen. Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat the illness of the spleen, as we have said from the treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment is not effective, then cautery in it is according to three ways, which are all right.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of these is to make three cauteries, or four, lining them according to the length of the spleen according to the figure of the liver cauteries, which preceded.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between every cautery a quantity of thickness of a finger, or a little more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the mode of cauterization be as we said in the cauterization of the liver, equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the weak one lie on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another way of cauterization is: as having a cautery with two handles, which we said in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder: and elevate the skin, which is on the direct spleen, where the elbow of the left arm reaches: and let your elevation be such that you elevate the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two burned cords far into it, until you penetrate the skin from the other side; then withdraw the cautery: thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with a cautery having three handles.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cautery after you have allowed it to discharge pus for many days, for it is more effective than anything that has preceded from the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On the manner of cauterization in dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	Cautery does not fall in dropsy, unless it is applied properly.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat Hydropsy with the methods of treatment which we have said in the division, and the cure does not avail, then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery over the stomach, and another over the liver, and one over the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one on the direct chest, and another on the direct stomach: and let the quantity of depth of the cautery be near to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then release the open cautery so that it may discharge pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the weak patient from treatment after cauterization with him: because it is necessary that two intentions be gathered together with him: and he will hasten to him healing with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be a clamp: according to what preceded, its shape. And that with which the back is cauterized, should be an olive according to what preceded its shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the manner of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When abscesses are treated in a Hydropericardium, and are filled with yellow water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot between the auricular and annular; and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The water of citron will then boil, and let the cautery be according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make on each of the two legs two cauteries in every leg, and let the cautery be made with the edge of a knife cautery: and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other lower than that, about the middle of the leg: and on each hip two cauteries: and dismiss the open cautery without treatment for a long time: so that it will subside from it some water: then cure it with the rest which we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the manner of cauterization in the treatment of a rupture.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the solution of the belly is from cold and humidity until it weakens the retentive and digestive virtues which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with modes of cure, and it does not heal: and you see the weak one enduring cautery of exuberant virtue, then cauterize him with a great cautery over his stomach, according to what preceded in the cautery of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries in the circumference of the navel, with a subtle cautery. And with a cautery above the alcatin above the alhosos large, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive humidities and the weak tolerating it, then cauterize it with a cautery on the comb, and a cautery on all of that; and perhaps you add two small cauteries near the large stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	It is indeed a healing treatment, whose benefit does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the manner of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When hemorrhoids in the anus are old, many, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted humidities, and they are cured with that which we said in the division, and treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauterizations on the lower spinal bone of the back under the armpit a little triangularly, and the cauterization under the navel as if it were two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is cold, and his food is not digested, and you see his face festering, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cauterizer, according to what preceded: and with a cauterizer over his spleen, and another over his Spleen, with a caulking cauterizer: and let the open cauterium go for some time: then care for him until he heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing the testicles after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut the artery, then apply the cautery which is similar to a ray of fire.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the burning (instrument) into the cut wound; and your last hand, until the cauterizing reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows; do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore the abscesses are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for that, when it is applied with ointment until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over linen, it is more ultimate in aid.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the manner of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the cutting and operation which we have narrated in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he is healed with cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore it happens to someone that he has a fistula, and it becomes old, pus runs out of it, and corrupt humidities.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is right that you examine her with a subtle probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then learn the quantity of its depth with a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then use fire cautery, which is like a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself ignited into the fistula itself and the quantity in which it entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat over it the cautery, until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to the quantity of your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself against burning the nerve, if it is there, or the large vein: or if a fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this, unless there is an opening in a fleshy place: and you consider, because it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If, however, the place is sealed and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time: then you know that it is now completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if they do not cut away the material from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a decayed opening in its depths, or like one of those: whose recollection will come at its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from a thick wind, and it is lessened because of this which weakens the patient, then it is necessary to cauterize it over almethen on the kidneys, with a cauterizer over the whole kidney with a cauterio clauili, whose previous description has preceded.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the very wound.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore will come three lines.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be more useful in healing.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the manner of cauterizing the Bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, until it can no longer retain weak urine, then cauterize its lower part above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, and with one cautery from the right side and another from the left; and let the length of this cauterization be according to the quantity of a knuckle; and cauterize it with a lower back cautery, or with two cauteries if you need it; and let the cauterium be closed as before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the Matrix.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When coldness and humidity occur in the womb and pregnancy is prevented thereby, and her menstrual flow becomes corrupted and delayed, and pain occurs to her at its arrival, then it is necessary that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery on the lower part of the back above the loincloth, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be clamp-shaped.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing an ache in a dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous humors flow to the Anchae abscess and become the cause of its exit from its place; and the sign of this is that one leg lengthens over the other when they are compared against each other; and the place of dislocation is found empty there.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the diseased part above the wax of its own cautery with a similar circle; after you have marked it with encaustic around the wax, just as it turns around; and so that the wax itself falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery whose form preceded be used in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If you do not have this cautery at hand, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery. And let the depth of the cauterization be according to the quantity of the thickness of all the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the manner of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the groin and the cause is cold and humidity, and the patient is treated with what has been said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes old: then it is necessary to cleanse the patient from gross humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the mode of cauterization in it is according to two modes: either cauterization with medicines that burn, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	A cautery with fire is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of these is to cauterize over the skin of the anus with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make for them a good depth, or a bad one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let there be a space that is between every cautery of the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be oiled.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes a cauterization is done in the middle above the head of the fossa itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip joint, one: so that it contains the whole hip.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the whole skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the mode of cautery for sciatica, when the pain adheres to the buttock itself and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cautery irons above the hip, above the place indicated by the sick man where there is pain, and with your cautery on the tail four fingers' width to the left side a little: and let the cautery be a knife.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient says that the pain extends nearly to the toes of the foot, then cauterize him there where he indicates with a cautery point, three, or four, or more if needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates pain being under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with a one-bladed knife cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And be careful in all your cauterizations, that you do not go too far with the cautery so that you burn the nerves, or a large artery, and thus draw through it over the weak ailment evil, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have indeed seen one and another of those who cauterized above the ankle, and lingered in the cauterization, and the leg was swollen until a tumor followed all the way to the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted; then there occurred a solution of the abdomen, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If pain is in two parts at once, cauterize both according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men said in cauterization of the anus, whose cautery this is the mode.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a probe like a awl from iron, whose diameter is the middle of a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a fingernail, or a little less: and inside that probe let there be a third probe.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	Let there be a space between every stitch the width of a finger's knuckle; and let the stitches be open from two parts; and let their height be like a knot, or two knots; and make for them a handle out of iron fitted centrally into the stitches.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is set on fire until it glows red and throws off sparks; then it is placed over the ulcer of the limb of the sick man lying on his healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore cauterize him with three round cautery instruments in one vice.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let him be dismissed after three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterward apply plasters with butter: and leave the open wound for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, "This kind of cautery, my sons, we have used little because of the terror of its appearance; and therefore, because we have found few who wait upon it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless it is good for those who suffer, and find with it a place for it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cauterium, however, with medicines burning, is so that you make two pouches having a perforated arm, into which descends the hinge of its gate from brass or iron, the length of the wall:  of which the height shall be two knots, or like themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be a space which is between the two quantities the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let them contain themselves against each other, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it upon the padding of the bed, the patient lying on his healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand upon the patch of flesh much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour water heated with a little fire between two circles and keep it for the amount of an hour's time: and let the sick person endure its biting and burning, for he himself has found that the biting is like fire until the biting ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then elevate your hand with an instrument, and wipe away hot water from the whole wound with sweet water; then let it be left alone for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place over this butter until the blackness of burning is removed; and let it stand for several days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the last resort in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If pain extends as far as the hip or leg: make for him a statue in that which contains water, according to what you did in ancha equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the way of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unquenched quicklime, each a part, grind them both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part has a small hole according to the amount that will enter it; and place another pot inside the bottom of the pot; and pour over the alkali and quicklime from sweet water, so that both are submerged by a finger; after which you compress them with your hand good compression, and set aside the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the smaller pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather all that water and throw it over another lime stone: and stir until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be strong and very sharp, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in cauterization of the remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	For it produces an operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And of medicines there are those with which  large wounds are cauterized, just as with the powder of almond and lime mixed with soap, so that both are well mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed narrating retold, of a certain man from antiquity the cure, with which he was cured pain of the hip and sciatic vein: and magnified it to be greatly.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that it did not need further treatment, and that it was healed from the one wound, until it returned, because perhaps he himself had entered the bath, brought there, and went out from it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, as it should be taken from the green sitaragi: and if it is not found green, take it dry, fresh: and it is to be ordered much with a little fat, and placed over the ache, where pain is, whether in the leg, or in the hip: and let it be applied, and removed after three hours, or for the quantity that the sick man feels sedation of burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore the body becomes moist, introduce it into the bed.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For pain departs, and healing comes.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not right for anyone to use a cautery with these medicines unless after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides said that goat dung, when it is cauterized with the vein of Sciatica, helps: and the cautery is made according to this manner.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep spot which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the ankle bone, and is nearer to the ankle bone.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung and ignite it in a fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place him upon wool, and let him be, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then again that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore, do not cease doing this until sensation returns through touch up to the end and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this mode of cauterization is called cautery Vaccinum.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	On the cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from the evacuation of superfluity, and things similar to these, from the infusion of cold and moist material: and cauterization indeed does not apply except in this single kind, which is made from the infusion of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after evacuation of the patient, with foul pills and similar ones, three lines should be made across the back, where there is pain, according to the width of the affected area, after marking the lines with encaustic, on every line five cauteries, or more according to the quantity that comes from the endurance of the patient and his strength: and cauterization shall be done with a cautery point.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries, or four, with a medial clamp cautery, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the manner of cauterizing an incision in gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLIV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often happens to young children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in boys is: that which happens upon him constriction in breathing at elevation, and movement: and you find it in the last vertebra of the back and its knots, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you see that and wish to make it, then cauterize it with a cautery which is circular according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let him take the cautery over all part of the vertebra equally: and if you wish, cauterize in the circumference of the vertebra with the cautery points two lines, or three: and let the points be near to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the place, until it heals with what we said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you administer a cautery in the hump, which is formed in the spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterization for gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When pains of the joints are from cold moisture, which is poured into any limb of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is customary for physicians to call that properly Podagra.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore gout is treated for its cold cause with modes of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then cautery will remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, as you cauterize him after evacuation at the juncture of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be Olivare.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its shape.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to put points on the face of the foot, then make with a cautery points.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize the area above every knee with three or four cauterizations from all sides, with the same cautery as Claudius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If more are necessary for you with this cautery, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If, however, pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what we said from cauterization in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If there are pains only in the hands, then prick at points around the focus of pain, such as two lines revolving.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If there remain pains in the fingers, then prick them, above every knot, and above the comb of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If pains ascend after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both sides from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not discharge a sick person from good regimen, from the taking of medicine.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is followed and phlegm is evacuated, he will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the method of cauterization in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When rupture occurs in the groin and intestine or spermatic cord descends to the testicle, and this is beginning to be near, then it is necessary that you order the sick person to abstain from eating on his day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use emollient substances so that stool descends from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and command him to hold his breath until it comes out, or appears the spleen or intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a cautery under the rupture over the bone of the breast, with a sign whose extremity is similar to half a circle toward the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then a fire cauterizing, whose this is the form, until it comes white and throws sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or the rectum to its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then the assistant places his hand over the place so that the intestine does not protrude; and you have already opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a board under him, and one serving over his legs, and another over his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery over that mark, with your hand and the standing cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you bring it to the bone; or carry it with a different tool, if you have not brought it together with it at first all the way to the bone.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine at the time of your cauterization, so that you do not burn it, and that there may not come through it upon the weak either death or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not obtain with a cautery an opening of the bone, your operation does not help.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be fine, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care with the remaining ointment until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you give him nourishment in accordance with the length of time of his healing, which will soothe his belly so that it does not leave the intestine at the time of defecation and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to rise after forty days, then administer a well-made bandage, and let him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should avoid labor and overeating of food and drink and loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when this regimen is used, it heals with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I shall say the cure of ruptures with an incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen and are beginning, and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize the rupture of it with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned from then be like one-third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for him as we have said: and nothing else shall be added.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some first said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it has been marked with encaustic wax, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a cautery closed.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But a cautery is first easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the manner of cauterization in pains due to a fall, or percussion.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens in certain limbs by chance, or by blow pain; and that pain perseveres for a long time, and it does not help in it healing with medicines: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	Let the cautery of every member be according to the size of it, and its ability, and its weakness, and its power, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed from the first cautery, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then repeat over the same cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because it is customary for these pains to shift from one limb to the one next to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary that you follow them with a cautery until the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the manner of cauterization in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Leper sometimes are helped with cautery and great help.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the kind of leprosy, which comes from the rotting of phlegm and black bile: when therefore you wish to cauterize it, consider this.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore leprosy is ineipiciens, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it has not descended, nor stood; and fear that over the infirm body corruption will encompass the whole complexion of him: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head known, and a second below towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And last your hand with the cautery briefly, until it makes a small impression in its bone, and the crusts are loosened from it, that the emission of thick vapors may be relieved from it, and cauterize also the spleen with the cautery, as has been said before.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	If leprosy has already spread over the infirm person and appears manifestly, then it is necessary to cauterize with these cautery instruments, which we have said in the beginning, and cauterize on the end of the nose, and two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one over the hip joints near the base of the tail and one above it, in the very middle: and two over the thighs; namely, over each thigh with one, and two over the knees; one over each knee, and two over the shoulders, and two over the forearms, and two over the tendernesses of his chest: and cauterize him over every joint, from the joints of his hands and feet: and cauterize over every heel of his feet, and knuckles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are above the heel bone, lest you burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the breastbone, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the rib.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add cautery, it is more helpful, and more efficacious.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not find pain in cautery as the healthy do, because his body is already numbed.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that cauteries be of magnitude and size according to members and joints; according to what preceded from the kinds of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care with a cautery from flour of herb with honey, and the rest of the cure, until it heals.

Caput L.	Head L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a certain limb is numbed, and it is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize that numbed limb with cauteries, according to what the size of the limb deserves, or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery be driven into the thickness of the skin a little.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized to some kind of numbness that happens to the hand and foot, in the shoulder blades of the back at the exit of the nerves that move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But he should not presume upon it, unless he is wise in the anatomy of the members, and the egress of moving nerves from the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the method of cauterization in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Chapter LXI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras becomes antiquated and does not agree in it with anything from the ingenuities of medicine: then cauterize upon it itself with a deep cautery for a little while, according to the quantity of thickness of skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and arnoglossae leaves, and dove's blood, and kingfisher blood: let one part be taken from each: mix all these together, and spread them on cloth, and adhere them to the place until it is healed.

Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	The wise men said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	To me it does not seem right: because I fear that it will become an ulcer: and I have already seen this several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said; or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the manner of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter Fifty-Third.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an abscess and it is slow to ripen, either because of the excess pus forming it, or because of the age of the patient, when he is decrepit with little blood, or because of time, and a desire to hasten the ripening of the abscess, then cauterize around it with small cauteries, puncturing many times.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let it go.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it itself will hasten with maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If, however, you wish to make a perforation with a cautery, then set the cautery on fire, which has this shape.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And lay him in the middle of Abulcati, until he penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from what follows weak, so that it may lessen the course of purges.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the manner of cauterizing a bad corrosive wound.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Consumption is nothing but corruption in a moving member, and it consumes itself, like fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see corrosion in a place which can tolerate cauterization with fire, then cauterize it with fire, much cauterium, small and large curettes, according to what is convenient for the place in which the corrosion is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every part until you eradicate the whole corruption, and nothing of it remains at all.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let him be dismissed for three days, and put on the places cauterized sulfur rubbed with oil, until all scabs are eradicated and all corruption is gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for him with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days flesh is born with a healthy birth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not, then apply the cautery again over that which remains from the corrupt places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And sometimes it is treated with a sharp medicine when corroding.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it rises in place of cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Nevertheless, a cautery with fire is quicker healing; and I indeed have already said cauterization of it with sharp medicine in division: therefore receive it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cauterization in the nails and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This pain often occurs in the lower parts of the feet; it is a large, thick mass that harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed there is a cauterization in these things according to two modes: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As much as it is with fire, the cautery should be like a concave beak of a raven's feather; which is to be made from iron, according to the quantity that it contains nail from every part; and have a fine edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it ignited upon a stick.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then roll the hand with a cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and let it go for three days until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply a poultice of crushed willow bark with salt, and leave the poultice on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	It will be removed from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with ointment of flesh generation, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not converted, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then administer to them cauterium with hot water: and it is, as you shall take a tube from copper, or iron, or from the wing of a bird: and place it over a spike, or an altlul.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small quantity of hot water into the tube: hold your hand and turn it with pressure from your hand for a short time, so that the edge of the tube is pressed against the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail. And let the patient wait for about an hour after the application of the hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release it, for the claw is removed with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Thus do with these one after another until you come upon all who are in the body from among them.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them after they are removed, with what produces flesh from ointment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the method of cauterization in trembling.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When someone has trembling from cold in a nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries, or five on the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra with cautery, and in his chest with cautery, and on his stomach with cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor rests with the olive cautery and health hastens in the case of coldness of ailment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul matter, that is, pustules, are expelled from the body of Albathir, which are made from corrupt coarse materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, first of all, when they appear, it is necessary to cauterize the entire head of the boil with a fine cautery and myrtle wood, whose end has been set alight with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long birthwort.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes the adhesions are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they do not increase; and the superfluity breaking them, they heal from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	Nevertheless, it should be done after evacuation with venesection.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the manner of cauterization for blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many times blood flow occurs from an artery which has been cut at a wound, either externally or at the incision of a boil, or cautery of a limb, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When this happens to someone, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger over it; and tightly compress it until the blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing comes out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place in a small oil lamp cauteries and many more, and blow over them until they are well-ignited flames.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or a little, or a large piece, according to the wound and place where the artery is ruptured, and lay the cautery upon the very vein, after which you remove your finger quickly: and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled with the finger from the mouth of the artery and the cauterium is extinguished, then take another cauterium more quickly, from those which are prepared in fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore, do not cease doing this one after another until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerve that is there, and evil befall the sick person further.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to cut it off: especially when the artery is large, except with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is taken out, the extremities of it contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it may be tied with a strong ligature thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or medicinal substances may be placed upon it, which are of a property to stop blood, and it is bound with a poultice-like constriction appropriately.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But he who administers its cutting with a band, and stenosis with a cloth, or the placement of burning things, and similar things, does not benefit him entirely, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If this happens to someone, and there is no physician or medicine present, then he should begin with the position of the index finger over the opening of his vein, as we have narrated, and constrict it strongly until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be moved, from above it with cold water of very great coldness always, until the blood clots and thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile he should consider what is needed from cautery, or from medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	The end of the First Part.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Book of Surgery of Albucasis Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have said in the first chapter about every ailment in which it is convenient to use fire and medicine burning together, and its opportunities, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed there chapters from the top of the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I shall proceed in this chapter along the same way: so that he who seeks may be relieved of his sought-for thing.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin this, it is necessary that you learn, O sons, that in this chapter there is that which is from terror that is in the first chapter of cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of this, greater caution is needed, because in the operation which is in this chapter, often evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of a fistula, or healing of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which tremor and fear are associated, and death falls in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, let not that thing fall upon you in which there is hesitation, for sometimes modes of men with modes of ailments fall upon you in this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	Among these are those who are angered by their illness, and death is light to them; because of the vehemence that they find from their infirmity and the length of their malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when pain is from fear it signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And of these there is one who gives his tibia and dictates it with him, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not right that you consent to him who comes to you from those, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	Let your caution be stronger than your greed and avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume anything from that, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies among you that which has arrived at a praiseworthy outcome.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And attend to the care of all your patients, with prognosis and indication of that which is fitting for health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	In that, indeed, there is for you aid in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you guidance and inspiration; for it is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I indeed have arranged this Chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization, from the neck to the feet: that your seeking of what you want from it, and what you need, may be eased.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the treatment of water that gathers in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this infirmity happens often to boys at birth, or when a midwife tightens the head of the boy without ease.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it also happens even from an unknown cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I indeed did not see this illness in others than in children: and to everyone whom of them I saw it hastened death: therefore it seemed good to me to omit the operation on it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I indeed saw of these a boy whose head was filled with water, and his head increased every day until he could not sit upon himself because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this humidity indeed, either collects between skin and bone, or it gathers under the bone above the fascia.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on that, if there is moisture between skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to find a fissure in the middle of the head, one in width: and let the length of the fissure be like two knots, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the shape of a spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then put these two incisions, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from all sides, and water is depressed when you press it with your hand to the interior, and it does not hide from you: then it is necessary that you find three fissures in the middle of the head, according to this way.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind fissures with cloths and pads.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then embrocate it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligament, and care for the wound with a pad and ointment.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not let go of tightening the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick with every dry food little humidity, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another way of incision is, that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes it is on the back of the head, or on the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore ascend with the incision where pus and water filling appear to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, so that you do not cut the artery, and there occurs a flow of blood, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	On the incision of arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When pus occurs to someone's eyes or chest, and it becomes old, and medication does not help: then the last cure is in that, incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you wish to cut them, let the weak head shave itself.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries may appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the weak one tighten his neck with any of his cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein pulses.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And those places are places that are behind the ears depressed: and rarely is it hidden, except in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with wax on both sides: and cut both with a spatula on each side, the incision reaching to the bone; and let it be across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert a spatula under the artery, and cut it upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating outflow, which leaps into the interiors with frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary that measures from the ear the quantity of space three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then signs with a lead cautery, and find up to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which ought to be emitted from the blood is VI ounces and perhaps you emit more, or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	The whole thing according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the sick person and the filling of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains near the bone from the excision, then cut that out so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with ligatures from linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man an old headache, or acute catarrh because of acrimonious humidities, and heat in the temples, or an old, violent soda, and similar ones: and it is treated with modes of medicine's cure, and it does not help: then we have experienced in these diseases the extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the manner of operation in extracting them is that the weak should shave the hairs which are on the temples, and apply to the artery appearing in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For indeed it is shown to you by its pulse, and rarely is it concealed except in a few men, or with extreme cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then let the sick person wrap their head with any cloth of theirs: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or place vapor with hot water until a manifest appearance appears to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula which I formed a little while ago.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape away the skin with it until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw a hook into it and extract it upward until you have drawn it out of the wound and made it come out from the tunics that are underneath it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is fine, then wrap it with the tip of a hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that part according to the quantity with which its extremities extend, and contract, so that there is no flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not struck, and if it is not cut off, blood does not rise fully.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate from blood six ounces, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a double, strong thread, of silk: or from cords of aloeswood, so that it may not quickly proceed to its own putrefaction before the consolidation of the wound, and there be a flow of blood.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the superfluity which is between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery up to the bone, until its extremities are cut and it will stand in the place of that same work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	It is better to do so unless if the weak one has a fever, or a hot constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For a cautery is one of those things which help to end moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better healing.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of arteries, that the place be filled with old charcoal: and pellets be placed upon it made in a central way.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the solution it is treated with dry medicines which make flesh grow, and with plasters until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If while you are operating blood flows from an artery, then hasten to cut it off with a cauterium, or to fill the place with zegi; and bind your hand until the blood is stopped.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those things is present for you, then place your finger over the location until the blood clots.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And embrocate the place with water of violent cold until the sharpness subsides, and be bound tightly as is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is lighter and easier to extract the artery, it is, that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades: and let the sharpness of the two blades be similar to an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp, like two knives, apply cold to both; and they will not cut the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When therefore there is a little thickness in them, fire heat is applied to them and flesh is quickly cut away; with this work is better than all works, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space that is between two knives be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with encaustic: and put both burning ones well, until they come to the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that it may be lengthened which is between its extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they are not thoroughly consolidated with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of a cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of acute and constant flow of tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are continual tears, and there is a flow of them from the veins that are above the skull externally: and it makes no difference in them anything of medical treatment with medicines, and you see the face of the sick already red, and he feels on his forehead walking, as if it were the walking of ants: and his eyes are exhausted, moist, so that they are already corroded with corrosion: and his eyelids have been heated from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients devised in the cure of them this operation, and called this cure, with the Sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is, as you should instruct the sick person to remove hairs that are on their forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then, in the forehead, make three incisions equidistant according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be as two fingers, and one incision be equidistant in length from the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length somewhat from the movement of the shoulders, and the third on the other side: and beware of the incision of the arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all incisions be the quantity of three fingers joined together: and let there be a prepared sponge for you, or many dried cloths, with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a spatula of two sharp ends, whose following form is.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is at the side of the temple, as far as the second incision; and scrape with it the whole skin which is between the two incisions, together with the fascia, which is over the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do this also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this spatula and again introduce into the first incision another instrument which is called a culter-like sharp one on one side, blunt on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the attached flesh with skin, and its blunt side towards the bone: and drive it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all vessels which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision shall continue up to that which appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then make it in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after an equal quantity of blood has run out, express the places from the clots of congealed blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every fissure of the skin from boiled intestines, and place over them cotton balls soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the ligament, and administer much infusion with lukewarm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment of basil oil, and other things which are used to heal wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	On the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs of the eyes from within the head.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When anyone has acute, sharp, persistent catarrh, and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their appearance already debilitated; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and there is a sharp, painful pain in the depth of the head, followed by sneezing: then take from these occurrences that those matters and catarrh do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And better treatment for these is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, as you instruct the sick to shave their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut one incision in the middle of the forehead, or another somewhat lengthwise, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be up to the bone: and stretch your hand from the temples which move when chewing: until when the bone is revealed: and you will dry all the blood with sponges.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with a cauterized gut, or with linen ligatures.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind from above with wool: and soak the wool with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess may not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you have loosened it, and see that the hot abscess has already diminished: then it is necessary to cauterize the bone until new flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow; as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and prepare a poultice from them, and apply it to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On the treatment of that which falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Anything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as a chickpea and beans; or it is a fluid thing, such as water, vinegar, and things like them; or some kind of animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone falls into the ear, or a kind of stone from those which do not grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if then you see the stone, then distill into the ear something of violet oil, or sesame.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer its extraction, and make him sneeze with the condiment, and plug his nostrils at the approach of sneezing, after you have placed wadding from cloth or wool around the ear, and extended the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For this ailment often occurs.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If it does not come out, then administer its extraction with Gesti, that is, Pizigarolis thin ones: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore he goes out with a gasp, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer its extraction with a thin, curved hook of little duplication.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If it does not exit through that, then make a tube out of bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear opening a great deal, and cover what is around the tube with wax softened with oil, so that there be no way for the wind except through the tube; then draw it out with your own breath attraction strongly.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For often indeed it happens as we have narrated.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If this method does not work, then take from helkalimbat, or from viscus, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught, a small amount: and put it at the end of the radius after you have wrapped upon it a cotum placed squarely; then introduce it into the ear foramen with facility, after you have dried the ear from humidity.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then hasten to cut it open before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the manner of incision is, that the surgeon first make a cut on the diseased one's head and draw blood from it according to the measure of its virtue.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and find a small fissure in the root of the ear in the place depressed by its fat; and let the fissure be lunate in figure, until you reach the stone: then remove it with that which is possible to you from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sew the fissure with speed from your hour, and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If something falling into the ear is one of those grains that grow and swell, then administer its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not obey you at the exit, then take a thin, subtle spatula, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the excision of that kind from the grains, which fall into the ear, and do not do this when you think that that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you place yourself a multitude of splints: then extract them with hooks, or with a fine thread, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it may be alleviated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water which enters into the ear, it is necessary for the sick person to use a sneeze with some condiment first; and already he has filled his ear with a little boiled old wool; and he lies on that ear, in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it goes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of the finger, thin, soft, and heat them with fire for a little while, and let the sick person insert one of them into the hole of his ear: and let him leap upon one foot from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore, do not cease doing this with stone and stone until all the water emerges.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now water goes out so that you take from papyrus or from rush one and insert one end of it into the ear: and set the other end on fire until much of it is burned.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another hook and do this many times until all the water comes out, and withdraw it with a tube according to what was previously said about the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In extracting an animal that has entered it, if it is small in body, like a flea and the like, care for it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of a large body, which appears to the sense; then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks: and the affair of it is easier than all those held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm that has been generated in the ear, when you have treated it with what we have said in the division, and in the treatment of distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you must look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something appears there from worms, then remove it with pliers or with subtle hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however nothing appears there, then take a cannula, whose form is this, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the delicate end into the ear according to the quantity which the sick person can tolerate; then suck with it with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you at the exit, then tightly surround the pipe with cauterization, as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not exit as we said, then administer distillations which the ancients have already tested for the destruction of worms: and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring of oil and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it from silver or copper, narrow below, with a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Therefore, let what is driving in the cavity of the cannula be made of properly centered metal.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a rod and wrap it at its end with a piece of cloth in a decent wrapping; then throw oil or juice, or whatever you wish from these medicines into a tube; and let the tube be in the ear; then introduce the rod with the cloth from above, and squeeze it with your hand in moderate compression until the oil is driven into the concavity of the ear, and the sick person feels it inside; and that which is poured into the ear should already be warmed with a little fire; and beware that what distills into it is not very cold: for medicines do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of the accident of earwax accumulation.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some men that an inflammation occurs in the ear passage from a wound, or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this poultice is sometimes made deep in the ear hole, which sight does not reach; and sometimes it happens to the outside of the hole a little, and sight reaches it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore that which happens in the depth of the ear, and which is not comprehended by sight, is in many dispositions difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows the sight, you ought to place the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look at it: then if you see an apparent hairiness, open it with a fine spatula, whose form is this which follows, let its extremity be in which there is some small width, whose part be sharp: and the rest of the spatula be gentle on two sides: so that it does not injure the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the earwax is born of flesh in the passage of the ear: then hold it with a fine hook, and cut it with facility of force until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the suppuration is deep in the ear, then take a thin, soft rod and heat it slightly with fire; then put it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel swelling with that which the sick person finds with heaviness of hearing, attempt to open it with facility: and beware lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place licorice in the ear according to the amount of width of the opening which you have enveloped in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are secure about the consolidation of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take licorice and pour it into rose water, and pulverize over it ground zinc, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear already suppurating, then it is necessary to extract the pus and allow it with another lint cloth, which you wrap in a cauterized bandage that has been made with rose oil, until the abscess sits hot; then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If it happens that there is a flow of blood, then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water and place them over the ear: and use the remaining cure which cuts off the flow of blood as previously stated in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the treatment of a wound in the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	Injuries of the eyelid which occur sometimes are humid and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, it is necessary that you hold them with pliers: or with a hook, and cut them with a spatula from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place powdered ziziphus over the areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many times they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots burn up and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of prolapsed eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many times something happens in the eyelids that is similar to a grain in its hardness and strength, and because of this it is called a Granuloma: and it is an aggregation of gross moisture in the upper eyelid, and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation therefore is, that you consider then, if there is a gland proceeding in it, which appears from the eyelid, and move to every part, and its matter is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore, make a cut across it.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from every part with ease until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it away.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If you do not prepare the cutting for him before you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then it will harm him in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the fissure is large, then gather it with suture and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no evil will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment restores it itself, and makes flesh of it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the granulation is large and slopes towards the inner surface of the ear, then turn the eyelid back, and suspend the granulation with a hook: besides which you will need to make an incision, and press it from every part.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is lengthened through an incision, it does not harm in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the cutting of a cataract with salt water; and take care of the place with it that it may become flesh until the sick man is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of a harelip
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the tunic of the upper eyelid: and it happens most often to children: and it weighs down their eyes, and catarrh occurs in them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the light of the sun, because tears rush to them, and therefore you see them lying on their faces always, and sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under the eyebrows, which have already been covered by inflation: and the prominence of Axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the mode of operation is that he place his head in your bosom.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth, and prepare a ligature in it, and make a circle from that ligature according to the quantity that contains Axirnath from every part.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place him upon it, and press with your fingers from every part, that Axirnath may be gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture with a spatula cutting incisions across its width, and let not the incision be larger than that made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Either it is necessary to cut through all the skin until you reach Axirnath, for in many arrangements Axirnath proceeds from a fissure according to the shape of white fatty twig.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore extract it with the cloth, which you have soaked between your fingers to the outside: and you turn your hand right and left until it is scattered. And beware, lest you add it into the fissure, so that you do not reach the eye with the spatula and wound it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If you do not see Axirnath at the beginning of the fissure, add a little into the fissure with ease until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then remove it, as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the site, and bind it with a splint.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are some men who grind salt and place it in the hollow of the fissure so that it may liquefy what remains of that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If a hot abscess occurs in a place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	On ways of treating a drooping eyelid, that is, when the eyelid softens the eye so that it wrinkles as it ought not.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow on the eyelids beyond the course of the natural hairs, and age: then they harm the eye, and cause modes of illness, such as frequent tearing, and softening of the eyelids, and clouding, until it becomes the cause of the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And a cataract of the eye is cured according to four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or with fire by cauterization.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, according to what was said before in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or it is treated by Ataxmir through incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or through tubes, as I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You must place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If therefore it turns, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce a needle into it, in which there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs are born: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with the radio.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula cutting from the greater lacrimal gland to the lesser lacrimal gland.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the thread and place a small piece under the eyelid from cooked cloth or linen; then sign over the eyelid with encaustic wax so that it is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid; because indeed it is diversified in men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From these [techniques] is one who needs that it be cut from the eyelid a quantity large, according to the quantity which softens from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then when you have marked two lines with the spathulum and begin from the larger lacrimal gland to the smaller one, and let there be a fissure near the natural hairs, as thick as the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce a hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape the entire lesion.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather with suture the two lips together, with a needle and fine wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and make adhere what is superfluous from the threads over the two supercilia, with some things that are hard to come by, if you wish to do so: and if not, do not care.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and thread for three or four days, then care for it afterward.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, let the wound go without suture, and care for it in such a way that it dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid must be raised when sealing a wound and bringing it together; but it will be better later.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This mode of healing Ataxmir taught the ancients.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	Nevertheless, there is concern over the sick person, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is in Atxamir also: and it is, as signs on the eyelid a figure which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate or combined hooks, according to the following form, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equality of incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If it is not possible for you to hold the hook and it is not equal: then take an awl in which there is a thread, and introduce it in the middle of the figure: and introduce another thread near the greater tear duct, and the second thread near the lesser tear duct: and gather together between your fingers the threads with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then lift your hand with an equal elevation; and lift the skin above which is the signated wound, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather the two lips of the wound together with a suture: and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If however an abscess occurs at your incision or your fissure: then treat that abscess with a cautery and similar things, from sedative ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens that the eyelashes also turn inwards.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you ought to use that which we have said about incisions; but suture is more artificial on both sides.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the treatment of ataxia with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, as you convert the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is inside, according to what I have narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then by art make two canes, or two fine strips of wood: the length of which should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a spatula: and you have already cut at the extremities of both from both parts where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather both together with subtlety over that which is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and bind two canes from both parts with a strong binding, and release it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For if the skin is tightly bound, it will die and become discolored and rot until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore it delays, then cut it with shears.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is consolidated, elevate the eyelid: and hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the shape of two tubes, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On the elevation of piercing hairs in the eye with an awl.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation consists of taking a fine needle and inserting into it a thread made of fine silk, soft.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then bring together the extremities of it, and knots both knots very finely: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then place another subtle thread under the first in Alinxotati [a type of surgical clamp], and tie the ends of it if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the patient lay his head in your lap, and be near the sun as the operation is declared; because it is a subtle or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce a needle with an awl into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you extract it from above the natural eyelash.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the needle up above the incision; and introduce the needle into the incision: if there is one, or two, or three, no more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it until the hair comes out with its root in the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If however the eyelash is pulled out and the hair does not come out with it, pull the eyelash downward, with the thread which you have composed in it, until the eyelash comes out of the upper opening, and you see it with your eye: then pull the eyelash and the thread, and extract both, and close the eye: and let him keep it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate with it a long hair from natural hairs, and elevate it with it; or let it go, until it lengthens after a space, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of an ulcer that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to the eye, it is called Leporino.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Al-Zahrawi is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore, an accidental wound is made from the consolidation of a wound, or section, or cautery, and things like these.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the mode of operation on it is, that you may find that consolidation and that you may separate its lips, and place in it what is between them a ligature made of linen, and bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not proper that you use in its cure things that dry and constrict, for if you do this, Alxatrati will return worse than it was. Rather use those things which soften, such as hay: and embrocate with water in which has been cooked marshmallow root, flax seed; and ointment of dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some oil; and envelop with it licorice, and care for it with this.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your treasury of healing is, that you endeavor with every skill, so that it may not be solidified, according to the form which was in the first place.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have said, is nothing but a certain rectification of Alxatarati, so that it does not return to the form of the place according to what it was altogether.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the treatment of a tumor on the lower eyelid, which is a wrinkle or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This incision which is made below, is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	It is natural and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And an accidental wound is made from a cut, or fissure, or cautery, and those similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way of operation in it is, that you take a needle, in which there is a doubled thread, and dye it in flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lachrymal to the right lachrymal, until the thread comes to both extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upward with a knife, and cut it with a wide spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it ought, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a probe and put it in the fissure, and turn it with it eyelid: and find two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and an angle is made of them; until when they are gathered together, the figure of them is made thus, and is the Greek letter Lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount which is the lower sharp side of it, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts together; sew them with a wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Thereafter care for them with that which we have said, of softening medicines and poultices, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an laceration should occur from a cut or suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make the incision flat under the eyelashes, also according to what preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a ligature, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the sum of the discourse on the cure of a wound from an ax, whether it is above or below, is that the treatment should be carried out according to how the wound was prepared according to the form of the ax.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is of many varieties in form: and a prudent craftsman prepares the organ in every possible way until it returns to its natural form, or nearly so, and the patient himself, according to what is suitable for him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid solidifies with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of the radius under the eyelid and raise it upward: or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a spatula of fine subtlety, which should not be with the sharpness of the incision of spatulas, but rather blunt for a short while: so that the sick person may not be disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and does not damage the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as though you were excoriating that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns according to its natural form, and the adhesion heals completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour saltwater into the eye, and wash it with water; or distill into it from a sieve made, from linen dissolved with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen thread: and place above the eye wool soaked in alum and white of egg: and on the third day use sifter, and with solidifying matter until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the cutting of the nail and the prominence of the flesh of the tear duct.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that a nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is a nerve; and it is similar to the sinew, fine.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not fleshy, like the frozen moisture of white: which when it touches iron or you attempt to grasp it with a hook, it breaks off and the hook does not catch in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds do not begin, unless from the greater tear duct, as far as it goes gradually, until it covers the desired amount, and prevents light and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the mode of operating in the incision of it is: that the sick person places his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and lift his eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect a sponge with a hook of small duplication, and extend it upward.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle and insert into it a thread from horsehair, oxhair, or wool. Let the thread be strong and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the hoof. And pierce it with the needle and tie the hoof with the thread, and extend it upwards.  And scrape with the hair the side of the hoof that follows the pupil, and if you bind it with hair to its very end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the residue at the root of the lacrimal with a fine spatula, or with small forceps: and let go the natural flesh of the lacrimal, so that there does not happen from the incision of it a continuous flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes a nail is extended with a hook, or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it shall be scraped with a spatula of moderate shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful, lest the spatula touch the corneal tunic and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, put something of salt ground up, or from sifting made of zinia, into the eye and let it be until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for him with what is necessary until he is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the claw is not nerve-bearing and you cannot introduce a needle into it, nor does a hook fasten in it, then this kind of claw is cured many times with medicines, and heals as I have told in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the sick person, and take a spatula subtle, gentle, of weak sharpness, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And with a subtle shaving shave the area from above.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it becomes thin and breaks apart, and a razor imprint is made upon it, then distill from your hour into the eye an extract made from ziniar, or from red sief, or from ground salt: and cover the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then iterate over the same operation until the whole of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless it is contrary for you in the eye a hot abscess: then indeed dismiss that, and take care of the abscess, until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it with reason until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	If the prominence of the lacrimal flesh harms the eye greatly, it should be suspended with a hook and a part of it incised; and do not make the incision to the end so that the flow of tears does not occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then a drop of wine (or made from zinc) in the tear sac, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	On the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in some human eyes there is born flesh red in color, composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles the stalk of a rose.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation in this also is that the sick person put his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and collect that flesh whole with suitable hooks to it: and hold it with one forceps, or tongs.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first until the whole of it is finished with a cutting instrument.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And guard your eye so that you do not wound it during the operation: and let your incision be with the same thing which you cut with, or with a spatula, which we have told of in the incision of the nail: or with small scissors, with which one gathers the asbel, according to what will come its shape after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore the incision is complete, and the whole algoudenici is removed, then fill the eye with salt ground; or distill into it a powder of red and similar to it from corrosive medicines; and place above the eye a cotton ball with the white of egg: so that it may be secured from a hot abscess.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If something from the blade remains and you have a hot blood flow, and fear a hot abscess; then release the eye, and treat it with that which will settle the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then iterate over it with the operation until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do with flesh added which happens in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that the treatment of every weak eye, whether by natural or accidental way, be performed with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you see that that member is enduring that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On collecting the style from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	There are red veins that are woven over the eye and prevent the sight from carrying out its function: and they weaken the eye as the days lengthen.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary for you first of all to consider if the eye in which there is a Sebel is strong and there is no other pain except Sebel; then collect the Sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is, as you prescribe to the sick person, that he should put his head in your bosom.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be a fine doubled one, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graduated in one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with fine forceps those veins with subtlety, and wipe away the blood every hour until you see those veins removed from the eye, and resolved: and beware lest you wound the eye with the edges of the spatula.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in midday before the sun, and be firm in your operation greatly: that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then distill into the eye a green or red ointment: so that its sharpness corrodes what remains of the scab.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If it is not possible for you to collect the whole thing in that hour, then apply a poultice to the eye with something that will soothe the pain of the eye; and leave it for several days until the pain subsides; and secure it from hot suppuration; then repeat over it in the same way until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the shape of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the reduction of the arrisatus to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Surgeons call a fistula an "Arissati," which they treat with cauterization, or with a sharp burning medicine, according to what has preceded in the narration.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it: unless you find a collection of pus at its birth, and extract the entire moisture which is in it and pus, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore a bone is discovered, and you see in it corruption, or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called Asperi head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron, and let its head be round like an azir, which is to be marked with the point of a file, or the point of a chisel with a fine point: and put it over the place corrupted in the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll it between your fingers, and you press your hand briefly until you know that the corruption is already scraped away; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with medicinal dried astringents.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh is born in it, and the course of healing is severed: and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not suppurate, and no accident happens in it: then know that it is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no talent in him, unless he reduces the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, as you remove from the bone with an iron instrument, or with a sharp medicine: and when the bone has been exposed, then take a borer according to this form, let its iron tip be triangular: and its wood be pyramidal extended to the end, just as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it over the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and extend your hand away from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then roll your hand with the trephine until it penetrates the bone, and feel that it is yielding; by this you will find air coming out of it when you hold your hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with hemostatic and drying medicines, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh is born and the place hardens, then the matter which was poured out to the exterior returns to the nose; therefore it is lighter upon the weak.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the reduction of the prominence of the eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with its entirety, and there is no harm or diminution in vision, then it is necessary to loosen the diseased part; then let him make a bloodletting; afterwards place vents on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put over the eye a liniment made of acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tighten the eye from above over the plaster with many pads.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of a few is: that you may take soft cloths, many, and every cloth be doubled out of them over four: make many from these: then place them one upon another, according to the quantity which the Eye needs: then bind upon them with a hard cloth a strong binding.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And again wounds with suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the wind-filled [parts], and leave the eye tightly closed day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If, however, the ligature softens again, then it is necessary that it be tightened a great deal; then remove the ligature after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye already returning to its white tunic, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plasters, and poultices, and constriction, and fomentations, until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the incision of the urinary tunic.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the tunic of the eye, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of wheat, and the appearance of man is defiled because of it, and you wish to cut it: then the operation on it is, according to what I tell: and it is, that you introduce a needle into the root of the eye from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another needle into which there is a doubled thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and let go of the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the vein on the circumference of the needle: and tighten it very much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract the point and put over the eye wool soaked in albuginea; and let it go until the thread falls with water.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with that which comforts it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the eye is bound by a circle of cloth from every part until it gives great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a fine spatula until it reaches the depth of the eye, and the albuminous moisture is scraped away, and the eye descends, and immediately enters; then it is tightened until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the treatment of dislocations.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This ailment called Alcomnati is nothing else but a pus that gathers in the eye, similar to water descending, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the mode of operation in it is that you make the sick person sit on the prepared seat, or directly.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head in your hands from two parts, and move it until you see the stream arrive at the lower parts with your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is fastened, so that it does not descend, and the opening is closed: and the sick person may see things as he used to see; and if it does not descend below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however the descent of the bowels is not prepared with that which we said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a subtle spatula and find with it above the skin tissue near the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the circle, until pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When he exits, then distill into the eye hot water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled hay and honey; then cure with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of water which descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	Now we have discussed the kinds of water in division, and which is suitable for piercing, having explained it with words, then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Therefore you must make the sick person sit between your hands, square to the light, near the sun: and tie his healthy eye shut, and bind him firmly; then with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye, or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand the almond if the eye is left; or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of the probe near the crown through the thickness of the radius in the apparent conjunctiva of the smaller lacrimal eye; then push the probe with force and you will turn your hand with it until it penetrates into the conjunctiva of the eye, and you feel that the probe has already reached the hollow.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the journey from the almond to the depth be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and it is the circle of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the pupil itself of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almond until it reaches the place where water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards with one finger after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore water descends, then the infirm person sees it above which he opens his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore water should flow down, then put it aside second, except that it may go out from the almond.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is set, and does not ascend: then extract the almond with ease: and you revolve your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something of clear salt in water: and wash the eye inside with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place a whole wad of cotton wool or soaked wool steeped in rose oil, and with the membrane of an egg, and tie the eye together with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, and those of our time, put upon it a mixture of ground cinchona with albumen of egg.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the eyelid does not obey you at the entrance into the eye because of its hardness, because it is from men, whose eyes are hard indeed: then it is necessary that you take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose shape this is.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, perforate with it only that conjunction and not the last of your hand into the hole; and there is nothing but to make a way to the almond place subtle.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almagd, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And in the completion of your work, prepare for the sick person a room well-made, in which he may lie on his back in a dark house: and forbid him from all movements, and from coughing: and put food before him that soothes his nature: and let him not move his head right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the ligature remain according to its arrangement up to the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then solve it in that dark house, and try to experience its sight; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament up to the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not proper that he should do this at the hour of healing, or immediately after the incision: indeed, it is necessary that he transfer it elsewhere; because water ascends quickly through vigorous aspect.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If however a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary that you loosen the eye before the seventh day; and correct it with what soothes the abscess, until it is soothed; then loose its vision, and place over its face an oral [potion] which regulates its vision under those few days, itself being in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he shall go out of the house gradually, and turn in his affairs.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in surgery a student is not excused from seeing often: then indeed he may dare about the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed it has come to us from one of those who are from Al-Rayy, who said that a large hole was made in Al-Rayy, through which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Truly, therefore, I saw no one in your land who has done that; nor did I read it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the kinds from the book, so that he who does not know them may stand upon them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of metal, and let their extremities be triangular with this same fineness, and the tip acute.
Formae magda.	The shapes of wounds.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the treatment of flesh born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes fleshy growths of a different kind are born in the nose, of which some resemble the legs of many scorpions: and from this there is cancerous flesh, stony, dusky colored: and from this there is also flesh that is soft, not dusky coloured.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In those things which are from these flesh is gentle, not deceitful, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands opposite the solid one, and open his nostrils, and throw in a hook to those flesh: then draw them to the outside, and cut what you have grasped from them with a sharp fine spatula on one side, until you know that all the flesh has already been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If something remained of it whose cutting is not possible: then carefully remove that with one fine instrument with ease, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If blood governs you, or if a hot abscess occurs, then oppose it with what is necessary. Or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is cut off, and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then vinegar, water, or wine is poured into the nose after incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then know that it is already healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it is flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument does not reach when cut.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Therefore, you must insert a linen thread which has some thickness, and many knots in it. And place between every knot the quantity of a finger, or less. And instruct the infirm man, that he may put one end of the thread into the nose with a stick, or as much as is possible to him after he has made himself a similar probe. And draw his scent until it reaches the cavity, and emerges above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times indeed boys like this Attomi make similar things in schools: and it is a thing easy for him who wants to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then put two ends of thread, one end which comes out over the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then and with a minister lock of flesh with knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is already with thread knots.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then extract the thread and place it in the nose after removing the blood clot which you absorbed with the ointment of Egypt: do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put a lead tube into the nose at the end of the matter for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it requires treatment that will dry it out, use this.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a cauterizing head, with which oil and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or copper: that it be like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passage similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making a cautery should be full and open: which has a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or what you wish from juices, and flowing substances.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the treatment of a nosebleed.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many times a tumor is born at the extremity of the nose, and it grows larger, and increases with days until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	Therefore, it is necessary that at the beginning of its appearance, one should cut into it and eradicate its roots completely.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place upon the site either a cautery or burning medicine which stands in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore the incision is delayed until it has become enlarged, then consider if it is stony, hard, dusky colored, with few senses; then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Many times I have seen those who had a bloody abscess and because of it great evil happened to him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is gentle to the touch, not dusky in color, and you see that incision is possible throughout its entirety, then evacuate the sick person, and make an incision into it without fear or trembling: and care for the place with something that dries and constricts, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when a rupture of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little is accomplished by operating on it, except in some men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you should consider if it is a wound recent with its blood; and then gather the edges of the wound together with suture; then care for it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of the continuity have already been separated, and each part has been made healthy: then it is necessary that the curette be scraped over the entire part with its sharp edge until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather the two lips together with a suture, and tighten them, and pulverize on top of it dragon's blood and ground frankincense: and put above the powders a piece of diaphana plaster, and of some other solidifying plaster: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then dissolve it itself, and change the medicine: and dismiss it until the threads are cut by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is that you bring together the edges of continuity, either with awls, as we recounted in the suturing of the abdomen: or you bring together the edges with thread, as I have made you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of lip nodes.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people experience abscesses on their inner lips, similar to hard grains of grain, some smaller and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary that you convert the lip and bind over every node of it, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it from every part.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with crushed zeger, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it is to be covered with vinegar, and the place where there is clotting is to be cared for with it until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On incisions in the flesh above the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many times there is born on the gum flesh which the ancients call an abulus.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore it is necessary that you suspend it with a hook: or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus run out, or the blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place on the rubbed wound site, or other styptic powders, drying ones.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does return, then cut into it again and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the extraction of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes they gather on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer part, and between the gums, rough, coarse, and sometimes they become blackened, and yellowish, and greenish, until corruption comes from it to the gums, and the teeth become foul because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you ought to make the infirm sit between your hands, and his head in your bosom, and grind and gnaw, at that which appears to you as bark, and a thing similar to sand: until there remains nothing of them, and similarly do with blackness, and greenness, and yellowness, and others until they are purified.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore that which is in them from the beginning of reason is taken away, it is good: and if not, then repeat upon them the reason on another day, second, and third, until the last study comes to that which you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth needs razors of various forms and figures: according to how it is prepared for your operation; therefore, the razor with which a tooth is shaved from the lower part is different from the razor with which a tooth is shaved between teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of razors should be prepared for you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you treat the tooth of its pain with every skill and delay in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing that can replace it when it is removed: because it is a sublime substance: so that when there is no excuse for its removal, then when the sick man is forced to remove it, he must strengthen and make sure of the aching tooth with you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often pain deceives the sick person and thinks that it is in a tooth and pulls it out; then the pain does not cease until the bad tooth is pulled out.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have now seen that from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore a tooth aching is certified to you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened from every part; then move it with your fingers, or with slender forceps at first little by little, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the large forceps in that spot and the head of the patient between your knees: which you have already held well so that it is not moved; then pull the tooth according to its straightness so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not emerge, then take some one of those instruments and introduce it under it from every side with facility, and endeavor its motion, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If, however, the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary to fill that hole with cloth; and bind it with the extremity of a fine wire, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction upon it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you act with great care when making an incision around the gum from every part very much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength, so that you do not break it, and may its part remain, and return over the sick from that evil which is greater pain of his first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste and boldness over its removal, besides administering that which we have recounted.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many times indeed they cause great illnesses to happen to men, the more difficult of which are those that break and the roots of them all remain, or some of them; or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have testified many times this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it shall be covered after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If it happens that blood flows from places (for this often happens), then smear something from the ziziphus and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if you cannot apply ziziphus.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the fine forceps used first for moving a tooth should have long handles and short grips, thick so that they do not fold when pressure is applied upon a tooth with them; like you see in thick handles, until when you tighten with them, they do not bend themselves nor fold; short handles, and be made of iron, or of well-crafted brass, straight handles. And at their ends should be teeth, some of which enter into others, and tighten by decent, strong constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes extremities are formed like the beak of a bird called a stork, and they have strong constrictions.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains at the site of a broken tooth's removal, then you must place over the customary spot some butter for one or two days until the place softens; then introduce into it an instrument, or forceps: whose ends are similar to the beak of a bird that is called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The shape of this is forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their extremities be made like a file inward: or like an awl.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not obey you towards the exit with these forceps, then it is necessary that you dig above the root, and uncover the whole flesh, and introduce the instrument which is called the Small Lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let the short end of the limb be rather coarse and not too wet so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments whose shapes are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first triangular extremity, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	Shape of a triangular extremity fine.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also used with this instrument having two branches, whose shape is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the extraction of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also let there be an instrument with this, which is similar to a large hook, of this form, triangular extremity twisted, in which there is something of thickness so that it does not break: and let it be not soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that instruments for the teeth are many: and similarly the rest of the instruments are not counted, and a prudent artificer, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument, according to what the operation signifies to him and the pains themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because they are from agricultural implements, for which the ancients did not say what instruments, because of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If a bone of the jaw or other bones of the mouth is broken, or if it rots: then examine it in its place with that which is fitting to it from the instruments and forceps which I have said in the extraction of roots, and help with a clamp, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be something of a size gradually inserted so that it is tightened or held with the bone, and not escape and leak, until the bone emerges; and restore the place with suitable medicines to it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there is a small amount of decay in the bone, then scrape away the decay from it, and take care of it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the closing of prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an ugly form is produced: and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely those of the genitals.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you ought to consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	If a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit, or it is possible to lock it, nor file it; then eradicate it: and if it is attached with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose shape is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and it is made of Indian iron, with a very sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be such that you cut it on many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth is not moved.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, it is protruding and exposed from its rasping, then scrape it with a rasp from within, whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let the entire instrument be from India, and the handle of it have many small punctures, like a file with which needles are made: With which one grinds the tooth gradually in many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved, and falls out; then smooth it, at the end scrape it with certain razors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If it is a tooth that is broken and injures the tongue, then it should be filed down until the roughness of the fracture is removed and it is leveled, smoothed, and does not injure the tongue or corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the binding of teeth with gold wire
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth are shaken and bruised by a blow or accident; and the weak one cannot hold it together when eating so that it does not fall out; and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment has not been effective; then the ingenuity is in them to be tied together with gold thread; because silver becomes green and rots after days; but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be of medium thickness and coarseness according to the amount it will take between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the suture is, that you take a thread, and insert twice its length between two healthy teeth: then weave with both ends of the thread between the moved teeth, whether one be, or more, until you come with the suture up to the healthy tooth of the other part.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the texture until you reach the part from which you began: and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is not moved at all: and let your constriction where you tighten the thread be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not escape.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the ends of the superfluous thread with scissors: and gather both together, and turn them with a twist: and conceal them between the sound tooth and the moved tooth, so that it does not harm the tongue: then let it be let go as tightly as it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it is loosened, or cut, bind them together with another thread, and it will remain so throughout the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of Teeth, and the figure of the rotation of two sound teeth, and two moved teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after an injury, and they remain as we have narrated, and this is done only by a skilled and experienced artificer.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a piece of bone from the rib is fitted and shaped like a tooth, and it is put in its place, so that the tooth is fortified and held together, as we have said; and it remains, and serves with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	On the cutting of the ligament that happens under the tongue and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament which occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is, that you open the mouth of the infirm person in his head in your bosom, and elevate his tongue; then cut that nerve ligament acrosswise until the tongue be loosed from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound, then throw into it a hook, and find it across its width, until you cut the ligament, and the knot is loosened.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware lest there be a fissure in the deep flesh, and you cut the artery there, and there occur a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then the wound is to be rinsed with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a linen ligature which the sick man should keep in throughout the night so that it does not harden again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If blood flow should occur, then place a crushed piece of zege over the site.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a rusty cautery which is suitable for it; then care for it with the rest of the cure until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of a ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes a tumor occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function; and perhaps it magnifies so much that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in this is, that you open the wound of the sick person before the sun: and consider the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, which does not find the feeling of the sick person; then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined to softness, in which there is moisture, then throw into it the hook and cut it with a fine spatula, and free it from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood overcomes you during the hour of your operation, then place crushed ziziphus on it until the blood is stopped; then return to your operation until you have extracted it with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it shall be covered with vinegar and salt; and care for it with the rest of the appropriate treatment until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes things happen between the throat and godad, that is, glands, which resemble algodad, which happen deforis: and they are named two Amigdalae: which when care with what we said in the division, and do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore it is a hard abscess, dusky in color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of ruby color and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather let it alone until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it yourself or it will burst open of its own accord.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and its root is fine: then it must be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation is this, that you consider before your operation, if its hot abscess has quieted and completed in quiet, or diminished by some diminution: then do so to make the sick man sit facing the sun, and his head be in your bosom: and open his mouth, and let a serving person receive between his hands, and press down his tongue below with an instrument, whose form is this.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or copper, that is as fine as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you have laid the tongue aside with it, and an abscess is shown to you, and falls upon it your gaze: then receive a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it out to the outside as much as you are able, except that you pull along with it something from the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, whose form follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is like forceps: however, the extremities of it are curved so that the opening of each one is directly opposite to the other's sharpness; therefore care should be taken that it be made of iron tempered, or wood soaked in alum.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose shape is this.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other following this same type of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, the patient gargles with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If blood flow should occur to him, gargle with water in which the barks of pomegranate trees have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and similar things from styptics, until the blood flow is stopped; then care for him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes abscesses are born in the throat, other than the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, cut it according to what I said in the incision of two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself had treated a woman from an abscess that was formed between her throat, which she drew to the groin, few senses, because it had almost closed her throat; and the woman breathed through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her eating, and drinking water; and she had already approached death, if she had remained for one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had grown so large that it had produced two branches until they emerged above the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore hastened and fixed one of them hooks.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I drew it out, and a large portion was drawn out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then cut it where it is grasped from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did that which had proceeded from the other nostril opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened his mouth and pressed on his tongue: and afterwards I fixed a hook into the abscess; then I cut away part of it from him, and there came out of it only a little blood: therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then she took some food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease to cut into that abscess many times over a long period; and an abscess followed in the place where I cut, until it was prolonged too much and with it that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore, I devised and cauterized an abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore I stood after the addition; then I walked from the place, and I did not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the incision of a boil.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When catarrh descends to the vulva and forms a pus-filled abscess and is long, then it is called perpendicular. And if it is in the lower part large and round, then it is called a vulva.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help: and you see that the hot abscess has calmed down from it, and is subtle: then it is necessary that you cut into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which from it is gathered round and does not have length to it, and is bloody or dusky in color, or black, and does not have sensation; then it is necessary that a surgeon make an incision of it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	There is fear over the weak in that.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the measure which I have said, and its length, so that you make the sick person sit facing the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument, of which the foregoing account has been made; then fix the hook in the uvula, and draw it down: and cut it with one of the two instruments which I have said in the incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut from it except what is added above the natural term without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	If you cut from that more deeply,  you will injure the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use that which we have narrated concerning the incision of the two tonsils: and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however the patient fears the incision: then it is necessary that you use ingenuity in cauterization of him without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the way of cautery on it is not except with sharp water and it is that you put the head of the sick person into your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press down the tongue of him with the instrument that we said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with lime that is not extinguished, and put it in this instrument, neither thick nor thin, and fill its cavity with it, whose form is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremity where medicine is placed be concave, like the cavity of a snail's shell.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with medicine on the wound itself: and let the sick person lie on his side so that saliva from his mouth runs inward from the medicine, so that it does not descend into his throat and harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you will from the first apply it upon the wound with a quantity of half an hour, until you see it already darkened and the inflammation calmed by medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to receive a bandage and wrap it over the end of the radius bone, and fill the bandage with medicine, and introduce the radius bone with the bandage into a tube from above, until the bandage adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times until you achieve what you desire from the cauterization of the vein.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it be left alone: for it hardens and falls off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you wish to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization wipe around the wound with a cloth dipped in butter, and cleanse it with that which is around it from the medicine: and cover it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it is treated externally with compresses, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This kind of treatment therefore is more healthful by cutting and farther from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes a wound is treated even with that which is more subtle than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take a cloth and hyssop and oregano and rue and sage and chamomile and wormwood, and similar herbs: and gather all these, or some of them, in a pot, and let them be submerged with vinegar, and let them boil: and the pot should be lined with clay properly: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which an instrument is placed hollow according to this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made from silver or copper, and let the end, in which is the grain, be introduced into the bone of the infirm person until vapor ascends to the tube above the cannula, until the tube becomes much darkened.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it many times until it stops.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, lest you make this cure at the beginning of the arrival of an abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	Generally he adds this in an abscess: and it ought not to be done unless at the time of the subsidence of its heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube and put cork at its end so that the bone of the infirm does not burn; because cork prevents steam from burning the bone; and this is from good care with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the extraction of splinters and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many times something adheres to the throat, either a fish bone or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore it is necessary that you remove what appears from them above which falls the sight, after pressing the tongue with an instrument near the sun, and it is declared to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And that which does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make a vomiting weak before food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps indeed the thing joined will emerge through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Let the sick person swallow a piece of breadcrumb, or lettuce root, or a mouthful of dry bread; or take a piece of dried marine sponge soft: and bind it with thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it comes to the place where the spines or bone are, and it is drawn out, then it issues forth.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with that which we said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a radius somewhat, and at the end of it there should be a curvature, so that it may enter its throat with ease; and let itself have its head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, so that he does not get a cough, and drive it in with his mouth, or spine, or introduce himself with his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	Truly it is better if the infirm one inserts, that is, because of his knowledge of the place of the thing annexed: and he pushes down or draws his hand with an instrument up, the whole thing according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it emerges.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the Extraction of Leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is treated with that which I said in the division from healing with medicines, and it does not help, then consider in the throat of the sick one in front of the sun, or in the sun after pressing his tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon a leech, remove it with a small hook, or with a thin stick carefully.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with these things: then take a concave tube, and insert it into the throat of the sick person up to near the gullet: then insert into the concavity of the tube iron ignited with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full mouthful of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and put his mouth into it, and do not swallow anything from it: and move the water every hour with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For when a leech feels water, it immediately falls.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If it does not come out as we have narrated, then fumigate the sick person with cinders, or with asa and the instrument which I have narrated in the fumigation of the vulva.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times because it will fall.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is, to take a pot, in which are live plums with fire: and let the pot be covered with a cover, in the middle of which there is a hole: and let the extremity of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw in the fumigation, and let the sick person put their mouth at the end of the tube, and close their mouth so that the fumigation does not go out until you know that the fumigation has already reached the bloodsucker.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately fall off.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the weak person endure thirst, and eat salty food, and other things, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is therefore necessary that he go out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which bloodsucker is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon it itself.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: unless because it has this curve that goes into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is like the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it seizes something, it does not let go of it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, of many modes, according to how their remembrance comes, namely one and one in this book: and they are diverse in the piercing of them, and in the cutting of them from two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one is of the kind of abscesses within itself, and that which it contains from moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is because of the places where it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and to each of these belongs its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from abscesses there are some which ought not to be pierced, except after the ripening of the pus within them, and the completion of it: and there are also some which ought to be pierced while they are raw, and do not ripen according to the completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like boils that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because an abscess when it happens near a joint and is prolonged to be until it rots what is around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: therefore it is a closer cause of contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess in the main limb: for if you delay its piercing until it matures, it will harm either it or through that member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	If it is near the anus, pierce it immaturely: and let it not be pierced if it is a raw abscess, not completely digested, except if it is near the anus so that it does not rot deeply, and lengthens to the interior of the anus, and becomes a fistula, or becomes at its end what does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary for you to know the hour of perforation of an abscess, which has matured according to its course: and it is in the sedation of pain, the recession of fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulse, and the sharpness of the head of the abscess: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess and the more prominent eminence: and let the perforation be deep in length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of the arms, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflex.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those which are reflected, go with a piercing according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When a boil is in fleshy places, it is better that you release its opening until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you pierce it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there is much dirt and filth, and perhaps the lips of it and its depth will endure.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain abscesses are pierced according to the width of the body as necessity demands; or according to what the limb needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer in small abscesses a small perforation, and in large abscesses a wide perforation; or many sections according to the similarity of the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And they are from abscesses, in which it is necessary that the skin be concaved; and it should be cut when it has already been made like a cloth, and has come to an end, that which has already died: such as what happens in many, that it swells, and with buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And among these are those which are cut with a cutting instrument having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And of these there is one which occurs like a myrtle leaf in figure.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And of these there are those in which a round incision is administered, and a lunar incision: and similar incisions to these.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	For that one who does not have a head, such as superficial ulcers and boils, it is necessary that he be pierced with a superficial perforation, or only leveled.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when an abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you do not hurry and extract all the pus in that hour; rather, extract a part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then the pus should be left alone until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then remove something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the gradation, until it emerges: especially if he is weak of virtue, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man decrepit: for the animal spirit is much dissolved from the animal with the emission of humors: and perhaps the weak one dies, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, pay great heed to this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have perforated it, through which you perforate the abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound is of a small abscess, or is a flat incision, then administer a lint made from linen, or old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if it is a large abscess, and there are many fissures of the opening, then it is necessary that you introduce into each fissure liniment, until they reach each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in an abscess you have cut away a part of the skin, or in the surrounding area scooped it out; then it is necessary that you fill it with old dung, or as when it is covered with cloth, or shaved linen wool without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then throw it out, and take care of it with what is necessary from ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If blood should flow during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after having soaked a cloth in them: and place it over the location of the bleeding many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If however the flow of blood persisted, then it is necessary that you administer a regimen and treatment and powders which I have recounted in many places in this our book, and from the division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is in wintertime, and the place of the abscess is among many nerves, then it is necessary that you pour warm pills with wine and oil, and place them over the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it be in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place poultices soaked in water, and oil, or him with wine and oil, and the whole thing cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you loosen the abscess and cleanse it, and administer to it what is fitting for its cure, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the method of distinction, I have already said about every abscess, how the way is to its cure individually and separately.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	On the incision of boils that occur in the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XL I .
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur on the scalp skin, and they are of the kind of boils, which contain sacs, like little pouches made from a hen's gizzard.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their kinds are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Of these some are fatty; and of these some contain moisture similar to clay; and of these some contain moisture similar to gruel and porridge: and the like, and of these there are also those which are hard and stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the cutting of all, and their extraction there is no fear, as long as in their cutting it does not oppose the artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation on their incision is that you should explore it with an instrument whose form comes after these, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	If it contains moisture, then dry it out by cutting it lengthwise with a shallow incision: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with a cut from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture is evacuated, then scrape out the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not let anything whatever escape from it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	Many times indeed it returns, if anything remains of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse a sponge in Egyptian ointment, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will eat away what remains from the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then again pass over the same tumor with the Egyptian knife second and third, and if it does not digest with that, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, then take care of the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If it contains a fleshy node, then cut it according to this form, with the incision shaped like a cross: and throw hooks between the edges of the incision, and scrape it from every part: and endeavor your strength in extracting the tunic that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If an artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you after this.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do in an abscess, if it is stony, from incision, and cure the same, according to what we said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And incision over a stony abscess is easier; because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses that are in the head in some men, with which there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Because I cut into an abscess on the head of an elderly woman and found the abscess like a hard and solid stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if someone struck it with something thrown, it would wound that thing.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other boils that occur on the head, besides those which occur in the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the section of all of them should be a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or place the perforation of them always from the lower part of them, so that the flow of healing may be relieved downward.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for him as is fitting from healing.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the cutting away of strictures in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the arms, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And those things that happen to them in the neck are some one thing and many: and they arise from each other: and every Strophula from them is inside its own tunic, just as it is in nodes and boils of the head, just as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these Strophulas.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from these there are stones: and from these there are those that contain moistures: and from these there are malignant ones, which do not obey healing.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that which therefore you see of good disposition in touch, whose manifest color is near to the skin, and moves to every part, and is not joined with nerves of the neck, nor with guidegi, nor with artery, nor is it deep: it is necessary that you cut it with a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line b to line g, and scrape it from every side: and extend the two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need them, as we have said in abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is a precaution, so that vein or nerve may not be injured.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the spatula not be too sharp: so that it does not add your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick one, and you cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you cut a vein or artery, or if it prevents you from operating, then put crushed zeigee or some powders that stop bleeding into the wound, and bind the wound, and let it be until the sharpness of the abscess has subsided, and the wound has softened: or until it begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is severed with a knife, therefore return to your operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then with your index finger examine if anything remains of the other small strophulis; therefore, cut them and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If the great vein is in the root of a strangulated hernia, then it is necessary that you do not cut the hernia from its root: rather, it is necessary that you tie it with a doubled strong thread, and let it go until it falls by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound on the belly, which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it itself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole Strophula is cut, then it is necessary to join the two lips of the wound, and itself immediately after you see that there remains no superfluity at all.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that there remains an excess because of the size of the Strophula, then it is necessary to extend [it] to cut its root and remove it; and administer the suture which we said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what contains moisture from the Strophuli, perforate it with a superficial perforation: so that the place of its maturity appears to you: and place the perforation below that which follows in the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the perforation a liniment with ointment, and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains from the corruption, until when you see the wound already cleansed: then take care of it with an ointment that generates flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the incision of the epiglottis due to an abscess inside the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said this incision is in the Epiglottis, and I did not see anyone in our land who has made it: and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In those having a synanchia, it is necessary that the section of the Epiglottis be made; when no help is given by it; because all veins and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or at both tonsils, when there is no pain in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the Epiglottis to avoid the destruction which is done from before-mentioned preparation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we want to cut the epiglottis, it must be cut under three or four circles of the epiglottis with a small incision across its width, in that which is between the two circles by the quantity that the section should be in the soft tissue, not in cartilage: and this place is convenient for the section because it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels from it are distant.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then he ought to extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he finds the skin until he comes to the channel: he cuts the vessels of blood if he sees anything from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he cuts the fistula as we have said; and it is signified over the incision of the channel from the phlegm that flows out of it, with that which is broken up, and the cutting away of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the open wound be left for a while.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the hour is removed in which the foreclosure is feared, gather together the two lips of the skin wound, and sew its own alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this discourse which we narrated, is not an exposition, unless they see that some of these abscesses has already opened the throat of the sick person: and the patient has been raised above death, and wishes to be intersected by his breath: They go to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe over the place of the wound with some respiration, and be saved from death: and for this reason they ordered the open wound to be left alone until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is three days, and as such: then therefore they ordered it to be sutured and cared for until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw with my own eyes, is that a maidservant took a knife and put it into her throat, and it struck the part of the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called upon to treat him, and I found him moaning, as is the moaning of a dead man.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore examined the wound and found blood that had come out of the wound a little.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore I was confused that she had not cut away the vein, nor had guided it; and wind was escaping from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	Therefore I attended to his wound and cared for it until it was healed; and nothing happened to the girl except a hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to better disposition of herself.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that there is no fear in the incision of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the incision of a groin hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess called Hernia gutturis, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it is much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is according to two modes: either it is natural or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	It is not natural certain talent.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	An accident is according to two modes: one of which is like swollen knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And another method is similar to an abscess which occurs from ligation of the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in this there is fear, and it ought not to be presumed upon with a knife unless in what is small; and you prove it, and investigate it with the probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fatty lump and is not suspended with any veins: then cut it as nodes are cut: and remove it with what it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then examine the whole of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place as much as is necessary until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On cutting open swellings called Nodes.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodules, and I have already said all their kinds in the division: and it is necessary that I tell here the difference between a Node and an Fistula: when there is doubt making.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	Therefore I say, that when the heat and fever and violent pains have subsided until the boiling of excess is calmed and putrefaction is complete, then indeed the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When a knot is present there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains them in its own bag called sifachin which corresponds to the color of the body. And its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha, and it is greater or lesser.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two kinds: either fat: or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of humidity are many, according to what I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a Node, you must examine it, and inquire into it first with the instrument that is called an Intromissor, according to what will come its form in the chapter that is after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the way to investigate abscesses and all kinds of knots is that you take this instrument and insert it into the moister place which you find in the abscess; and you revolve your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already pierced the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then your last hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw what was inserted, and consider what comes out in its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore a running humidity occurs, whatever its color may be; then dry it with a superficial incision, according to what I have said in the rest of the abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if humidity does not exit in the place of introduction, then you know that it is fat: therefore, make a cut over it having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from every part with ease; and guard the cyst if you can on it, so that you may extract it whole with the knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If, however, the bladder bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to remove the whole thing intact, since this happens often, then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	If anything remains from it, whether a little or a lot, a Node returns according to the most.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it conquers you, and there remains little from it, then fill the wound at its completion with some sharp corrosive powders; and bind the wound, and place above it what sits pus hot, and care for it with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore the knot is large, then sew its two lips together, and take care of it as with that which is incarnate.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however the pulsating or non-pulsating vein is opposite to you, then hasten and fill the place with crushed zegi, and loosen it for two or three days, until the wound putrefies and the boiling of blood rests; then return to cutting that which remains from the Knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	On instruments used for incision and piercing of the mouth.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	There are forms of intromittors, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	From these there is a great one, and from these there is a medium one, and from these there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let pointed instruments of square ends be made from iron, so that they hasten entry into an abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Experiences, and no, that is, piercing: and one of them is named beris, that is, piercing: and there are three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	Of these there is a large, and a medium, and a small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	It is necessary that these abscesses, and openings, and fistulas, and buboes be investigated by what is between them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And for others are made round, smooth, blunt, like large needles which they insert under the buttocks, from citron, or copper, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And better ones are made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And experience is also made with black lead, which is suitable for experiencing fistulas, whose concavity is reflections, so that they are reflected with their softness with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because some are long, some medium, and some short, according to the quantity of the width and constriction of it.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of hooks, and there are many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because these are simple ones, that is, those which have one care: and they are three kinds as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And of these are blind pouches, and there are three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And of these there are hooks having two curves, and there are three kinds: and of these there are hooks having three curves, and there are three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped; and there are three kinds: because among them is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	The ends of those which are cut are sharp, the other ends are not sharp: and they are not put thus, unless that help may be given to them in the scraping of Tumors at the fear of incision of a vein, or nerve: and that the weak may be healed by them, and find somewhat of tranquility from burning as he finds in the scraping of an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Magdala, and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of metal and are similar to a distilling apparatus, with which alcohol is made; and at the wide end there is a point hidden by a spatula; and through it it runs inwards and outwards when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of splints which are hidden between the fingers at the perforation of an abscess; and the sick do not perceive them; and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Wounds of the winds with which blood flow is cut off; and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of copper, or citron, round, of short length, as you see: and let them be fine.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of Winds be with you large and small, so that you may cut blood by them with speed when necessity requires, and then when medicine is not present to you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them for cutting blood in every place of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the hamstrings of the leg, and hip, and the wounds of the arms, and nipples, and belly, and groin, and the like of these, from fleshy, moist incisions.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they make small instruments from these similar to the cortices of a fist, according to their shape: with which blood is cut when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the care of the nipples of humans which are like the nipples of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the nipples of certain men swell during sleep (that is, when they begin to dream) until they resemble the nipples of women, and they remain festering with pus.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	He who shuns this, let him cut above the nipples with a lunar section, according to this form from line b to line g. Then flay the entire fatness.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards fill the wound with medicinal plaster.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with suture, and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If the nipple inclines downwards and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that two incisions similar in shape to a crescent moon be made on its two upper sides, each one containing the other at the edges of both, until there is a larger line enclosing the smaller, according to this form from line b. to line g. Afterwards, scrape the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about sutures and powders, which are necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not deem it necessary to make an incision of it, because of the restlessness of the sick man, or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a poultice submerged in corrosive ointment, and leave it, until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On perforating an abscess that occurs under the armpit.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses that occur under the nipple are of the kind of hard boils, which contain cysts, and from these there are those which contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Therefore, those which contain humidities, ought to be cut with a lunar section, according to this form, from line b. to line g. When therefore the whole that is in the abscess is evacuated of blood, then fill it with cotto vetri, and dismiss it until the next day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the tumor, and treat it with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If it is an abscess from the type of knots of Strophulus, then cut over it, as we said in the section on cutting over Strophulus equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If the wound extends so that it discharges pus, then administer a cautery to it, according to what we have said previously.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the incision of an abscess that occurs because of an artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is torn and the skin above it is sutured, often many times a boil occurs from there, and similarly with veins, so that a boil and swelling occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and inflammation are due to artery and vein are: because when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long, gathered deep in the body: and when you push on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there were a scraping sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is for the vein, is round on the manifest body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And a section above this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and groins, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very great.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore it is necessary that his care be cured with iron, and what from those also is at the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary that it be cured.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, upon that which is from them through the inflation of the opening of the Artery, make a cut in the skin in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, afterwards the Artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is uncovered.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert under it a needle, and make it penetrate to the other side, and bind the Artery with a doubled thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two Arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place which is between two ligaments with a lancet, until all the blood that is in it comes out and the abscess is loosened.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall away; afterward care for it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an abscess due to the cutting of a vein, then you should hold with your hand as much as possible of the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce a needle under the place which you have held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be in it a thread double, until you withdraw it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the ligature with the abscess itself with a good ligature; according to what I told you about the ligature of the uterus, from two parts with two ends of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If you fear that the thread being removed will cause trouble, then introduce another needle with a different thread under the entire abscess at the incision; press and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry up the abscess in its middle until it discharges what is within; then cut away the excess skin and release what was bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place over that little bit which you have submerged in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment, which is done with lead and ointment, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	On an abscess that occurs from a twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in an artery and vein, so it also occurs in a nerve; which happens to them through percussion, or from excessive labor, and the like: and it is most common in those places of the assistants, or the heel, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is found in many positions without pain: and when it is squeezed with force, it feels like a stupor in it, as if weak.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an abscess collected deep in the body, but it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go to the anterior parts, nor forward or backward to the posterior parts.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what is in the joints from these things, it ought not to be invaded with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps contraction may occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that which is in the head, or on the forehead, cut the skin with a knife.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore the abscess is small, then hold it with forceps and cut it away from its root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it; then remove it, and gather the wound together with suture; and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On cutting an abscess that occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter L I.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Certain people experience, many times, in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, growths which are called Fungalia, because of their similarity to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their root is slender, and their heads are thick, and their lips are turned inward.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there is a small part among these: and there is a great part that is highly magnified.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I have indeed seen a man, and in his belly there were two tumors, which were more like mushrooms than other things: there was no difference between them, white, small roots, and their lips were reversed, and they could be found, and moisture ran out of them always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore, I cut into it, and I found in one side as much as X and VIII ounces, and in the other side as much as VI ounces. And the operation in cutting them is, that you consider then, if the patient is moist and the color is white, moist, and subtle of root: then cut it with a wide spatula, and have cautery in fire present.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled during its section: therefore if you are overcome by blood, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see a weak and timid patient afraid of the cut with iron, then take a lead wire properly made and tie it with it to the athleul. Its method is what we said, and release him for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add lead to the constriction.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore, you should not stop tightening the lead until it is pressed into the drill and cuts off by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the root be thick, then there is some fear and trembling in its incision, especially because it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Nevertheless, it is possible to cut its half.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the wound until it is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware lest you presume to cut into that which is dusky in color, with few sensations, and of foul appearance: for this is a cancerous abscess: and I shall come back after this with a remembrance of Cancer.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of umbilical hernia.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	A protrusion of the umbilicus occurs from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures which are above the belly: and it goes out of it either the large intestine, or the intestine, according to what happens in the other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Either from blood that flows from the Vein, or from the Artery, according to what has been said before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or compressed from windiness in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If it is due to a fissure of the skin and discharge of pus: then its color is similar to the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and it appears in various locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is because of the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is, with that which we have narrated, of more diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press him with your fingers, he is hidden; then he returns, and perhaps there is a sound with him; and it is much magnified at the entrance of the bath, and labor pain.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If it is due to moisture, it is soft, then it is not covered when you press it with your hand, nor is a bandage applied, nor added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears black from the  incision.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If it is due to flesh born: then it is a grave, large, hard abscess and it takes shape according to the quantity of one.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is due to windiness, then its touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is, that you consider then, if the prominence of the navel is because of blood from the Artery, or Vein, or windiness: then it is necessary that you forbid its cure.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that there is fear and dread, as I have taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses because of the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the protrusion of the navel is due to the intestine or a hernia, then it is necessary for you to instruct the patient to hold his breath and stand upright extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with a cauterizing implement around the whole belly button.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then command him to lie down between your hands upon his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then around with a wide spatula on the circumference of the umbilicus over the place which you have marked with encaustic.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterward extend the middle of the abscess upward with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie him around with a strong thread or silk cord firmly bound: and let the knot of the ligament be well fastened.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the center of the abscess extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find it already captured by a ligament: then extract it with the forceps and introduce your index finger into it, and drive the intestine into the interior of the abdomen: and if you find a tumor, then take it with a hook and cut away its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however, the artery or vein is contrary to you, then wind around it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	Take two needles and insert two strong threads into them. And insert two needles into the circle you made around the abscess in the shape of a cross, so that they penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then bind the abscess in four places above the needle: and if you wish, remove the needle, and release the place until the extended flesh decays: and falls by itself: or cut it yourself when it becomes soft and decays.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with what is necessary from ointment until he heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the prominence of the navel is from flesh or moisture, then it must be scooped out like an abscess, as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And you shall draw out blood, or moisture, which you find there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for it with that which solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	On the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter Fifty-Third.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already said in the division of the kinds of cancer, and how is the way to its cure with medicines: and beware of it when curing it with iron, so that it may not ulcerate: and we have said about cancer generated in the womb, and beware of its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it; such as cancer that is in the nipple, or in the hip, and those similar ones, from members located to remove the whole of it: especially when it is beginning small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When, however, it becomes old and large, it is not proper that you approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I was not able to heal anyone from it; nor have I seen anyone before me who has succeeded in doing so.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation in that case, when it is located as we have said, is, as before, and to free the sick person from black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then if you find the lancet filled with blood plainly.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the weak with preparation, in which it will be spoken of with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw into the tumor hooks that correspond to it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards, hollow out the entire thing with a blade, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, rather express the places, and wipe away the gross blood altogether with your hand, or with whatever instruments are possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however a thick flow of blood from an incision in an artery or vein troubles you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as well as the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	On the Treatment of Hydrops.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	Now we narrate in the division of kinds of Hydrops, and how the gathering of water is made: and the signs of every kind, and its cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron, is only a species of asclisis alone; and it does not approach with iron the kind of tympanitis; nor the kind of hypocarchia entirely; for that one is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this type of Hydropsis of the tympanum with medicines, and your medicine has not helped, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	If weakness has already come upon the sick person, or if there is another infirmity with him besides dropsy: such as if he has a cough, or diarrhea of the belly, and the like: then beware that you do not treat him with iron: because there is fear of this.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If you see a patient with excessive strength and there is only dropsy accompanying him, and he is neither a boy nor an old man, then the mode of operation in him is that you raise the patient standing between your hands, and the assistant behind him expresses his belly with his hand pushing water to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a grooved knife, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let there be two pointed parts, long, and acute at the end like a spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	Nonetheless, let there be something of brevity gradually so that you do not pass through with it at the operation up to the intestines and wound them.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	If a generation of dropsy is from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you lengthen with a cut from the navel to a quantity of three fingers, to the lower direct above the breastbone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If, however, the generation of dropsy is because of liver illness; then let your section be on the left side from the navel three finger widths.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its generation is on account of the spleen, then let a section be made on the right side: and it ought not also to be a section on the side upon which the sick person wants to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the skin completely with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce your hand into that incision and lift it with the Spatula between the skin, and scrape, as if you were scraping it: and let the quantity which is scraped be the quantity of a fingernail, or about that much.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the skin until the sponge reaches the place of vacuum, and there is a place for water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is like a cannula: it is made of silver, or copper, or brass, soft and smooth: which has a small hole in its lower part, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side: and its end is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see: at the upper end of it there is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore it evacuates from the water in an hour a medium quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person will die in an hour through dissolution of his animal spirit; or it happens to him that he falls into a swoon which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Truly evacuate from it according to the quantity of its power, and according to what dispositions of the sick person signify to you from the pulse's virtue, and from its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it is held back immediately because of the skin which retains the opening which is above the sifa; about which I have told you, so that you may pierce it according to that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then on the next day repeat the instrument if you see that the sick person can tolerate it; and also withdraw from the water a small quantity.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself against error until there remains little water left.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If however you fear for the weak one, and release much water from him; then care for him with burial in hot sand, and much sweat in a bath and sun, and let him wait upon thirst. And care for him with drying medicines, until he is healed. And cauterize over the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of water: according to what I have narrated in that which precedes.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the care of infants who are born with their urinary openings not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter LVII.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone is born from the womb of their mother and the head of their offspring is not perforated, or is a stricture, or is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, one must help with its perforation immediately when it is born with a spatula finely and delicately, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put a thin lead rod into the hole, and tie it: and hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore he wants to urinate, he should remove it and urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put lead, it is now possible that the urine which flows over the place, will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He who has a narrow opening is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days until it is widened.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those who have a hole in a place not their own are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is because from those who are born, there is an opening at the end of the penis: therefore he cannot urinate forward until he elevates the penis with his hand upward.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	It is not generated because sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line, and it is a very foul ailment.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the mode of operation in this is that the sick person is laid on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of the rod with your left hand forcefully, and cut the head of the rod from the place of the penis, with a sharp point or knife; just as you would cut a reed, or something else, so that its middle comes out like the head of the rod: and so that a hole falls in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware during your operation of blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Many times indeed this occurs.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore oppose him with that which cuts off blood, and care for the wound until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	On Albucasis which things happen in the foreskin and head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adherence.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LXVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Many times these things happen to Albucasis on the staff, and there is a lump of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it some are malignant and some not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, you should not suspend a non-malignant tumor with a fine hook, and cut it off until you have completely removed it.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place upon it a compress soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it afterward with dyacin ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If Albather is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary that you administer cauterium in it after its incision and the excision of it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the foreskin of a captive who has not been circumcised is caught, and part of the prepuce is inside, and part outside: then it is necessary to remove the prepuce that is inside first, until it is healed, then care for the part outside; because when you care for both at the same time, the foreskin does not heal but is pierced.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And now also there happens even in the testicles and prepuce blackening and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to hollow out everything that has been blackened and which wants to be corrupted or already is corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then a line on top of it after this with honey that is already mixed with flour and the rind of pomegranate seeds, and herb triturate strainer-like.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If blood flow occurs, then administer cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	Cautery is a remedy for two dispositions at once, namely for the flow of blood, and for a wound when it is corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of a urinal is worn away and destroyed within an hour, then you should insert into its opening a lead tube so that the patient urinates over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adhesion of the foreskin with the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur unless in the one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound or abscess: therefore it is necessary that you scrape it with an obtuse Spatula until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish these subtle things, then it is necessary to excise something from the head of the penis and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is, because when the foreskin is thin, it may be pierced because of its thinness quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the prepuce and the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth which has already been moistened in cold water so that they do not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated with wine and a poultice until it solidifies.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the purification of infants, and the cure of diseases that happen to them by error.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like the rest of the wounds: but since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is proper to boys, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation, and a smoother way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books; because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Which is because I found that most artificers and bloodletters use purification, cutting with a knife, and with forceps: and they use the cautery, and tie with thread, and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I indeed have already proven all these methods, and I have not found a better purification with forceps, and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a knife, many times the skin escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the foreskin has two layers of skin: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower tunic remains: therefore it is necessary to make an incision to cut the other, and future pain will result.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with purification which is made through alfecati, that is, finger-tools, which surgeons use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not carefully made; because perchance it may enter into its foramen.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In the cleansing, however, if a nail possibly comes out, and spoils your operation; and indeed the skin of a boy is short in nature, and very often they are born thus, that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	The cleansing with forceps and a cord of thread proved good to me, because the forceps are proportionate to the incision; indeed, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When therefore you place your hand, two points are proportioned, and they cut according to the operation one at a time: and a compression is made of similar figure, containing the skin in its entirety from every side, with which no error at all falls.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the manner of operating is that you make him estimate, especially a boy, if he is one of those who understand briefly, that you do not do anything except tie a thread on his rod and let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way possible to you because of that which he receives through his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands, prepared in stature, and not sitting: and keep the forceps hidden in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy sees them not at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into its shaft, and blow into the skin, and draw it upward until the head of the shaft emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from that which is gathered in it as filth.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with a doubled thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards bind lower it a little ligament according.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligament well, and cut between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upward quickly and remove the head of the splinter.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros.	Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better), and place powder on top: and above the powder, a cloth in which a sponge has been boiled in rose water, shaken with rose oil.
Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Recently good: and release him over himself until another day: and care for him with the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the forceps for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let there be two blunt ends, and let them be intersecting: so that a branch of the clavicle does not go out from them; and let the length of two points be like the length of two manubria equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	An error occurring during purification is this: for perhaps the entire inside of the skin escapes, or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, it is necessary that you extend it from your hour with your finger before suppuration of the place; and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then remove it with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If it should happen that three days have passed and what is under the stick remains inflated, an abscess; then release it until the abscess sits warm, and excoriate it with ease, and cut into it according to how you prepare for it: and beware of the head of the stick.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore, treat it with that which solidifies a wound from powders, which we have narrated in the treatise on powders: and if it occurs from the skin above measure, and goes out to the upper parts, it does not harm it even so.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore care for it as we have said until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Urine retention in the bladder is caused by an obstruction made from stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born, and similar things of those which we have said of modes of cure in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if urine does not pass, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder; then it is necessary for the sick person to be bent over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet are laid upon his back, and he extends his belly from the upper part of his back, and he draws in his failing breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore it is necessary when the neck of the bladder is brought to expel the Stone backward: therefore urine is discharged.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not loosened with what we have said, and the matter is violent upon the weak: then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, whose form this is: let it be of silver, and be subtle, soft, concave like the quill of a bird's feather in subtilty of radius, long in similarity to one and a half palm: to which let there be a subtle cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the mode of exit of Urine through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie wool or cotton onto its end, good binding: and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe: and cut with scissors if anything remains from the wool, but introduce it into the tube vigorously, like a pump.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then smear the syringe with oil, or butter, and egg white: and make the sick person sit on a stool, and insert the catheter into the bladder, and its rod with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce a syringe into the rod with ease until it reaches the root of the rod.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it above from the navel region.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then drive the syringe into it itself until it reaches the bladder and feels that it has arrived at an empty space; and this is not done in this order unless because the passage through which it goes is twisted.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	Urine will follow wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then withdraw it, and make urine flow through the urinary tract; and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do this until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of cleansing the bladder with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood freezes in it, or pus is constricted in it, and water and medicines are distilled into it; then a tool called a Clepshydra is made, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is indeed deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it there are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which that thing is which drives it, let it be according to the quantity that needs it without addition, until when it is drawn with it something, it attracts from humidities: and when it is driven, with it expelled far away: according to what the clepsydra does, which projects naphtha, that is, Greek fire in battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore you wish to throw liquids into a vein, introduce the end of the syringe into the liquid, and draw with it that which drives upwards, for the liquid is drawn into the concavity of the syringe.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce the end of it into the rod, according to what we have narrated in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive moisture with it since that moisture reaches the wound immediately so that the weak one feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Form of a fine enema for irrigating the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Make it of silver or gold: whose head be higher like a small sickle, and underneath a groove where the ligament will fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a sheep's bladder, and put in it the moisture with which you wish to irrigate the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two sinuses with a strong ligature and double thread: and heat that moisture for a little while over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the extremity of the clysters into the rod, afterwards tighten your hand above the vessel with a decent moisture of constriction, until the sick person feels that that moisture has already arrived at the vessel.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it throughout its entire roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread into those openings, as they turn.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather a circle, as if it were gathered from a rope; after you have put in it what you wish of moist substances, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind the same thing to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder from expression with your hand, until moisture comes to the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the Extraction of Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have said in the division of the kinds of stone, and its treatment with medicines: and I have said the difference between stone generated in the kidneys, and the bladder, and the signs of the whole: and I have said the stone upon which operation falls with the hand and section: and it is stone generated in the bladder properly: and he who is fixed in the rod: and I am narrating this with manifest exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	Therefore I say that a stone generated in the bladder most commonly happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from the signs of this it is, that urine flows out of the bladder similar to water in its fineness: and there appears in it white sand, and the weak man rubs his stick with it, and labors with it, and many times hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is raised and exits with the rectum in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And it is an easy cure for children, up to the age of fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In young people, however, it is medium, in that which is between that and that whose stone is larger, the cure is easier: and if small, it is harder to treat.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to treatment, it is first necessary that we cleanse the sick person with a clyster, which will remove all the feces that are in his intestines; for sometimes this prevents the finding of the Stone at the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then take the patient with his feet, and shake him, and move him to lower: so that the stone may descend to the deep of the bladder, or leap from a height several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands, and let his hands be under his hips, so that the whole bladder may slope downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the Stone in the space, then hasten immediately with a cut upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe the index finger with oil of the left hand, if the boy is weak: or the middle finger if he is a complete youth: and introduce it into his anus, and inquire for the Stone until it rests under your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards toward the place whose section you desire: and order your assistant to press the scrotum with his hand, and order another assistant to extend the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with the other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part from the place where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce a spatula cutting, whose form is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find it in the space between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left hip: and let the incision be made above the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let a transverse section be made, so that the external section is wide, and the internal one narrow, according to the quantity that the egress of the Stone may be no greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger that is in the anus compresses the stone at the point of incision, and it exits without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from stone is made which has angles and margins, wherefore its exit is difficult because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from that it is smooth, like a gland, and round: and an easy exit is made of it.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, to him who has angles and margins, add to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out thus, then it is necessary to put the mind over it; or bind it above it with a twisted bandage, whose end be like the moon, which binds upon the stone, and does not escape from it; or that you introduce under it an instrument, of subtle curvature.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot work above it, then enlarge the hole a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something wounds you with blood, cut it away with a saw.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If however there is more than one stone, then drive first the largest one to the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut upon it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push a little after that; and similarly do if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is large, then ignorance is such that one should not cut over it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Because it happens to a sick person one of two things, either that he will die or that he has a constant discharge of urine, because the place does not heal at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion until it comes out; or using instruments in its fracture with forceps until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place upon it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: that a hot abscess may sit.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then place the patient on his back, on his neck, and not untie the ligaments, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you have loosened it, embroider the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however a hot abscess happens to be added to the wound, and corroded, and similar to these things: as if blood clots in the bladder, and urine is prevented from flowing out of it: and this is known by the emission of blood with the urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore introduce your finger into the wound and withdraw blood from it.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar and water and salt: and apply to it of every kind what is fitting from healing, until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the hours of healing the whole, that you bind two hams, and aggregates, because of medicines which are put upon the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small and is in the ureter, and it is fixed there, and prevents the outflow of urine: then cure it with what I have told you before you reach the section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times indeed you will be excused from incision by this cure, for I have now proven that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you receive a perforator from iron steel, whose this form is, of triangular extremity, acute, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and tie it with a stick under a stone so that it does not return to the wound.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the piercing iron into the rod with ease, until it reaches the stone; and revolve the perforator with your hand in the stone gradually; and try the perforation of it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	Urine, however, is completely passed at once.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remains from the stone on the outer part of the virga.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	He himself breaks and comes out with urine, and the sick one is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry over a stone in the very staff between two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, dissolve the ligament, and cleanse the congealed blood which is formed in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to put a thread under the stone, except that it may not return to the vessel; and another bandage from above, except that when the thread is released after the removal of the stone, the skin may return to its place, and cover the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you, when you tie the upper thread, to elevate the skin upward, so that it may return to its place, and cover the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the Extraction of Women's Stones.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LX I.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stone is produced in women in small amounts.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If however it happens to anyone of these stones, then healing is difficult, and it is forbidden because of many ways.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these things is: that a woman may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second reason is that you will not find a woman who will reveal herself to a doctor when she is chaste, or from those who have husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is because you do not find a woman well-knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is distance from the place of the stone: wherefore there needs a deep incision, and in this there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity compels you to this, then it is necessary to take a female physician who knows well: and few are found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you wish to do this first, then seek out a chaste and skilled physician and present the woman to an experienced midwife or one who is proficient in this art. Have her examined, especially by the stone that I have instructed you about in my inquiry.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, it is necessary to see if the woman is a virgin; then it is necessary for him to insert his finger into her anus and seek out the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore he finds it, he should constrict it under his finger, and then order the midwife to insert her finger into the womb of the feeble one, and inquire about the stone, after she has placed her left hand over the vulva and compresses it with a good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore he finds the stone, then it is necessary that he gradually moves it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with the utmost of his skill, until he comes with it to the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he cuts above it at the opposition of the middle of the thigh at the root of the hip, from whichever part it is prepared, and feels for the stone in that part: and his finger shall not be moved from the stone, pressing beneath it: and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he inserts a ray above that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore he feels the stone, then he adds into the section according to the quantity proportionate which stone goes forth from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you should know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From these things it is small and large, gentle and rough, long, and round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore know its kind, as it shall be shown to you by this above what you see.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If blood overcomes you, then add crushed zegel to the place and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone emerges; and do, that you prepare with you from instruments, which I said in the extraction of the stone in men, that you may help through these in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If blood flow overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery which has been cut: then place powder over the place, and bind it with a strip of cloth properly: and do not move it: and release the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place decays, then return to your operation until the stone emerges.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	On the incision for an aquatic hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The spermatic cord is not watery, but a collection of moisture in the white sifac, which is under the skin containing the testicle sac: and it is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in the fold of skin that nature has prepared for him in part of the scrotum, until it is thought to be: which is another testicle, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white tissue, which we have said: and this is not made except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And indeed the generation of this branch is from weakness that happens to the testicles: therefore this matter is poured out to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this humidity has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Either its color is sloping toward yellowness, or it is blood-red, or it is foul, black, or it is watery white, and this is the most [common].
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	If it is in the white scar that we have said, then the abscess is round to a short length like the figure of an ear: and the testicle does not appear, because moisture contains it from every part.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in its own cloth, then an abscess is round with a part of the egg, and therefore man thinks that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if humidity is between the skin of the testicles and the white tunic, then it falls under sensation.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to know the knowledge of color and humidity, then experiment with the color of humidity in an abscess when a square is inserted, whose form preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Therefore, according to what emerges from the trace of Intro mission, judge that which is between them.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you order the sick person to be bled if possible and see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he is laid on his back upon a slightly raised object, and many cloths are placed underneath him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left side, and command the assistant to sit on his right, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part above the navel.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, as far as near the pubic bone: and let the incision be made according to the straight line equidistant which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white surface enclosing them: and scrape this and observe, or rather beware that you do not sever it: and let your scraping be on that side which hangs with the egg more: and carefully examine with the scraping as much as is possible to you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then perforate the full syringe with water by a wide perforation, and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the knife upward, and do not touch the skin containing the testicles: and cut the knife however you are able to cut it, either in its entirety or in parts, especially its subtle side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, there is no security in its incision, but water will return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If however, it proceeds omentum exterior from its own cutting at the hour of your operation: then when you have completed the section of the siphun (a surgical instrument), reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as you would other wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find a corrupted egg from another blackness, then it is necessary that you bind vessels which are suspended, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut away the testicle with its suspensory ligament, and draw out the egg: afterward care for it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water is gathered into two parts, then you shall know that there are two branches: therefore dry the other part according to what you have done in the other equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it seems to you that there should be one operation, then do so; afterwards remove the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the incisions wool immersed in oil, or in rose oil: and put before this wool another which you have immersed in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the marvel of the belly: and put above double cloths, and they are bolsters: and tie them above with a bandage that is having six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths and stitch them together and fill them with a carminative powder, according to this model: and make the ends which are pressed from wool or wet wool: and bind them together with the band around the loincloth: and one end shall receive over the anus up to the back, and the second shall receive to the breast side: and two ends above the two lower hips, and two other ends above the two groins, and gather the whole band around the loincloth.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this scrotum is treated artificially with a cautery at the place of the incision with iron; and it is, that you take a thin knife-shaped cautery, and cut with it the skin of the testicles; and it is ignited, according to what we have narrated: until when it reveals the white sifac containing water; then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It is similar to the Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with that and ignite it until all moisture has emerged.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend a knife with hooks, and scrape with a fine cautery lit, and cut into it as much as possible until you have removed the whole of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware from egg, lest fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is healthier and farther from bleeding, and better than the operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, it causes you opposition at the time of incision or cauterization, a hot abscess, or bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary that you cure what opposes you from it with the care which is fitting for it, according to what was said before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If however the sick person is fearful and does not wait for this operation because of its horror: then administer the perforation according to what I tell you: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is made certain to you by what we have said about the meanings, that a branch is watery: then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit upon an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until water runs through entirely.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a pad over the injured spot, and bind it, and allow it to drain the remaining water; then care for it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however the contrariety is to the exit of water at the hour when you pierce it; and it is not otherwise, because the white panniculus makes contrariety in the opening of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which water from hydrops is extracted, whose form precedes: or add in the operation of the wound a little.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns and is gathered after six months, or thereabouts.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When therefore it is gathered together, then let it be closed in the same manner, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the treatment of fleshy branches.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in cutting above this branch, fear can lead to harm in many conditions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me his dismissal from there is salutary.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation upon it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that abscesses frequently occur in bodies, of which some are composed of testicles: and this comes from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Either from excess of acute or sharp which flows down to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or by percussion.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of an abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose color is dark and there is no feeling in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the tying of arteries, and their inflation: as I have already said in its remembrance: or from the inflation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	What is from these by inflation of the arteries, is known by the arrangement of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you must not touch it at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which is done by inflation of veins, does not disperse anything when compressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a section be made upon this kind, and upon the remaining flesh: and it is, as to cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then stretch the omentum upward and draw it out with a white sponge: and free the suspensory ligament from the cavities, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from all parts of the parts.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the egg has become consolidated with those flesh born, then it is necessary that you draw the egg out, and cut it open.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if adherence is between something from the siphon or in that which is between vessels: then it is necessary that you free the whole of that adherence, and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however it is a birth of flesh at the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that you cut the whole of it, and extract the egg, just as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool steeped in oil of roses and wine; then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the care of branches, which is with the vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	A boil is an abscess enclosed in a certain wrapping, like a tumor, with softening of the testicles: and it makes difficult movement and exercise on the weak and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the healing of this illness is fear, because of remembrance of what preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	Truly, it is necessary that we say the operation according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	Therefore I say that it is necessary that you make the sick person sit upon a seat elevated.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then drive the testicular sling downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with those vessels which are near the virga: and let another person hold it, and extend it with a strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a wide, sharp spade across the straight vessels until the vessels are revealed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then skin is scraped from every part, as we have told you in the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then make a point in it where there is a doubled thread, and tie it in the first of the places where the bites occur: and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry it in the middle incision straight according to the length of the body, and remove what is gathered from the fetid corrupted humidities.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for wounds as with the cure of other wounds, so that a vein which nourishes one testicle may be generated to fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not evil because of that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If it happens that the veins are all swollen in the scrotum, then it is necessary to remove them together with the testicles so that the egg does not be deprived of nourishment because of the incision and waste away or wither, and so that there may be no benefit from them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the treatment of intestinal ruptures.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXVII.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	This injury of the groin is from a cut that happens in the extended sifach over the belly in the area of the mirach of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from a tear, or an extension of it.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis.	And these two kinds happen from many causes.
Aut ex percussione.	Or by percussion.
Aut saltu.	Or by leaping.
Aut clamore.	Or with shouting.
Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	Or by elevating a heavy thing, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign, when it is from the extension of the siphon.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	There is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal toward the depth: because, that siphon compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from a section of sifach, because it causes a violent pain to happen suddenly from its beginning; and it is a different kind of abscess, appearing under the skin nearby: and this is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it emerges with a tumor of the intestine: and this is called Intestinal Ramp, and tumor: and sometimes it is done with windiness.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes stool runs into the intestine and is retained there: and this is harmful to the sick person because it causes bad pain, especially when pressed upon.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of these kinds of illnesses with iron there is fear: therefore it ought to be guarded against.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the way of operating is, that you order the sick person to bring the intestine back with his hand into the cavity of its own body, if he obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then, he is laid back on his neck between your hands, and his legs are raised.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin above, and cut the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fasten hooks into the two lips of the incision, according to how much you need to open the incision with them: and let the incision be according to the quantity, as far as possible, that an egg may come out of it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the skin of the testicle and that which is under the skin of the testicles until when it reveals the white, hard sifach from every part: then introduce your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white sifach, which is under the skin, and between the second sifach, and separate with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the scrotum.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with the right hand into the interior of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white sheet upwards, with the left hand: and elevate the testicle with the sheet to the part of the incision: and command the assistant to extend the testicle upwards: and you alone loosen the adhesion which is behind, complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And feel with your fingers so that there is nothing from the intestine entwined in the hard white cloth.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If you find anything from that [place/object], then drive it toward the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle which has a thick thread, made of ten threads; and introduce it into the last sifach, that is, the tunic which is under the skin of the testicles following the incision: then cut the ends which protrude from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then compose some of them over some with a figure in the shape of a cross: and bind them with alsifach, which we have spoken of, because it is under the skin ligament of the testicles, strong, until nothing from the vessels, which nourish them, can send anything to them: so that an abscess may not happen there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again the second ligament beyond the first ligament, distant from it by less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments are released from the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, the quantity of the size of a finger: and cut the rest entirely according to the roundness, and take out the testicle from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut dryly in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which blood and pus run, as we have narrated before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound: and administer the ligature that we have narrated.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes when the white sifach which we have spoken of is cauterized after its incision, for fear of bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	It happens often indeed.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let go of the ligament until it falls of itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, his case is delayed, then it shall be cauterized with hot water: and place upon it that which we have said, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the rest of wound care, until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	On the wind-blown lance.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXIV.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this treatise I did not find anyone who dared to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they said that it is done as we narrated in the branch which is with the Vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, as you have cut the vessels after the incision, easily carry them downwards; then dry them in the middle and take care lastly with that which opens them until the vessels fall; and take care of the wound, according to what we said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	On the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the place is prominent, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is small, and returns within every hour; but if time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added in the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from extension of the sifach, which is in the groins, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is because it extends sifach: then it softens, and the place becomes suppurated and prominent.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as his narrative has preceded.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cured with a knife, according to this manner: and let the sick person lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the rupture and abscesses and prominent one, with a cut across its width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the alsifak and that which is under the skin until when it reveals white sifach, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a ray and place it on the prominent place from the siphon, and press it into the depth of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew two prominent places above the end of the radius with a sifach, and connect one with the other with suture: then draw out the end of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the intestines at all, nor pull out the bowel, nor anything else, as I have told you in the cure of a ruptured intestine.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then comes the care for wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the thread, cleanse it, and restore the wound until it consolidates.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	If a hernia is contracted and no prominence is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And a cautery is better in this place; because it is closer to safety.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On softening the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because of which the flesh that is between them is also softened, and its appearance is disfigured.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for one who is asked about the cure of this, that he make the sick person lie upon his back, and cut the entire skin which has been softened over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture: and if you wish, sew in the first place the excess of softened skin with three sutures, or four, and make a firm suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the healing of the remaining wounds, until they are healed, and the threads fall away.
¶ De Castratione.	On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is forbidden in our law: and for this reason it would be permissible for me not to remember it in my book; and it is not necessary to remember it except for two ways.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of these is that a physician should know it when he is questioned about it and know how to treat someone who has it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another way is that we often need the castration of certain animals for our benefit, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore I say that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by rubbing.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Either through incision, and section.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by attrition, the way of operation is: that we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles become soft and pliable and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by incision and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligament, and dry above every ovum with one incision, until when two ova proceed: then cut them after having scraped both, and do not put anything above them from sifak except fine sifac which is over vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better when it is done by rubbing; because rubbing perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	On the care of a hermaphrodite in two ways.
Caput LXX.	Chapter LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from a man according to two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears in what follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in what is between the two testicles, a figure like the vulva of a woman, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women there is one type, and it is the vulva of a woman above the comb like the testicles of a man are small, altogether prominent to the outside: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of three kinds, two from men, and one from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut the added flesh until the impression of it escapes.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for the wounds after these have been treated.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In this second kind of men, from which urine exits, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the incision of the labia and the prominent flesh in all women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	Perhaps something is added to the natural thing, until its appearance becomes foul and ugly: and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much that it expands like in men, and even comes to copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, you ought to hold the superfluity of the tendon with your hand, or with a hook, and cut: and do not go too deep in the cutting, especially in the depth of the root: so that there may not be an outflow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound itself, until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	The flesh that arises is the flesh that is born in the opening of the womb until it fills it; and perhaps it comes out to the outside according to the likeness of a tail; and because of this some first call the ailment caudal.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore it is necessary that we should cut into it as we cut into a tumor, and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of Alratica, which is the woman's vulva not perforated.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter Seventy-Second.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The vulva of a woman should be unperforated, or have a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	An accidental condition is from a disease that precedes it; and this itself comes from flesh added which is born, or from sifach fine, or coarse; and it happens either in the deep of the uterus, or on its sides, or in its upper part, or lower part; and it prevents coition and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of it is obtained by the look of an obstetrician, if the swelling is apparent nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the abscess is from a subtle stitch and it is close to the two lips: then hasten, and break it open.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, that you put over two lips little balls.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your indexes of both hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch the two lips with fortitude until the subtle fissure ruptures and the opening becomes apparent.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool and soak it in oil, and put it over the place: and let the woman every day apply it so that the place does not harden again with other matter.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the sifach is large and thick, then it is necessary to cut it with a spatula wide like a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If the abscess is born of flesh, then suspend it with hooks and cut into it; and let medicinal substances be with you that will staunch the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus the coagulated albumen of egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a lead pipe, wide, so that the wound does not close quickly, hold it for several days; and administer licorice from dry linen, then cure with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes there is a birth in the womb of another's flesh: it is therefore necessary that they be cut according to this manner: as long as it is not a cancerous abscess for an abscesses cancerous that is in the womb, do not oppose with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red boils in women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter Seventy-Third.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are openings of veins, so that blood flows from them continuously in large amounts.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When hemorrhoids become severe, they become tethers: and I have said in the division of their kinds, and their signs; and I will say here what cures they receive, and which they do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	Therefore I say that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb and do not appear to the sense, then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those things which are in the opening of the womb over which sense falls, those are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, you ought to introduce the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the athehel with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut it from its roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then pulverize upon them at the flow of blood from one powder of incisions without corruption: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and so on, and similar things to these.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then he drives his feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterward, lay it in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the bleeding persisted, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, and rind of pomegranate, and galls, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it over his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore blood is cut with it, it is good: and if not, make to adhere to the back windy, and nipples, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and submerge it in the juice of tarathis, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglantar, Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the lion.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore an abscess rests, then care for the place with ointment until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth, however, is like the heads of Alhaasse, and it has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, you must cut what appears from it, according to what I said before; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Of the perforation of the uterus which happens in a woman's womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter Seventy-Fourth.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and bedsores, and scabies, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have indeed already said all these ailments and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I say in this treatise an abscess that happens in the womb when it is from abscesses that collect pus, and you wish to know how it is opened with a knife.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you ought to consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of an abscess in its beginning is acute with percussion of it, and flame, and fever: and you see it redden; if sensation falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and care for it with that which helps super maturation, until when it rests the sharpness of accidents.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit upon a seat which has two seats, and recline, or lean against her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of the belly: and let her hips be spread out, and put her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit on the right side and administer the instrument that opens the uterine orifice.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes in those that are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you set the peg with a sound depth into the uterus of the woman; so that what enters from the instrument may not be more than the depth of the uterus, and damage the weak one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If the instrument is more than deep, then it is necessary to place small pads on the roof of the deep matrix, so that the entrance of the instrument into the whole depth of the matrix is prevented: and it is necessary to place a whirl, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side; and that it may hold the instrument, and that the minister may revolve the whirl until the deep matrix is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore it appears that the fistulous opening is soft and smooth when touched by the hand, then it is necessary to cut it at its head with a wide spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the pus has been evacuated, then it is necessary to place a moistened linen cloth into the wound, submerged in rose oil: or in green oil, which has some astringency: and place the linen cloth, and remove the incision deep in the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally over the womb, and over the wool comb submerged in water, in which mallows have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it is cared for after two days with an ointment that is suitable for it, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the womb and wound are washed so that it is douched with water and honey; then with water in which lily root or long birthwort has been boiled; then return to ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If a wound has been concealed within the womb, then it is necessary to refrain from curing it with iron, rather care for it with what we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrine of Obstetrics, how embryos are treated who are born not in a natural form.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXXI.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for an obstetrician to know first of all the figure of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From the signs therefore it is, that when you see a woman compressing to the lower parts, and desires to smell the air, and is lifted upon her which is above her from childbirth, and hastes the exit of the embryo: then know that this birth is according to the figure natural, and is the exit of it upon its head, and secondary with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that the belly be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when he lowers it over his head, the second one descends with him, and it is purified from those superfluous things by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But that which is beyond this birth is unnatural, blameworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus emerges on its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet; or it emerges with its head and hands; or its belly; and perhaps it turns over on its neck, and similar remarkable figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is therefore necessary for the midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these things, and to guard herself from error and neglect: and I am showing every figure of them, and how the mind is in each one, and it is signified by this, and stands upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges from its head during its natural exit, and it becomes forceful upon the woman, and labor becomes difficult for her, and you see that its strength is already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her; and vapors of willow bark boiled with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife puts a small spatula between her fingers, and finds with it the second one, and cuts it with her nail until it runs what is in it of moisture: and presses the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then a woman should be given an enema of linseed and sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then direct him after the enema, that he be compressed: and make him sneeze with a  paste, and hold his mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will immediately emerge.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus emerge first, it is necessary to join them so that you may gradually reduce them with ease.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not obey on entry, then place the woman over a seat and elevate her feet upward; then strike the seat against the ground; and the woman must be held so that she does not fall during the concussion.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut them, and extract the residue of the fetus: and bind the hand of it with a cloth, and extract it with equality: for it will itself come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo onto its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges onto its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards level it out.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then he should take one of his feet and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they go out as far as the hips, then command him to press it down and have him sneeze with a concoction; for he will come out if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not emerge as we have narrated, then bring back the fetus gradually until you place it according to its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will then go out by an easy passage.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If this is forbidden with all that we have recounted: then take from the pulp of aloe, and sesame oil, and gum dissolved: and pound the whole in a mortar with good percussion; then put it on the wound of a woman's belly and lower abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in lukewarm water until she reaches the hypochondria.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that the lower parts are now warmed, then make for him a sif of myrrh and lay it upon him.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore one holds the sieve one hour, then let him make it sit upon the seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make him sneeze: and grasp his mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with easy compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fever will immediately leave.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it emerges in this form, then ingenuity lies in introducing his hands little by little.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman is laid on her back, and her feet hang down; and she lies on a bed, and folds her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press above his belly gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under his feet from the dustbins, until it is prepared on the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not emerge, then take its feet and move them with a vigorous motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press that which is above the hypogastrium gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then he inserts his hands and gently pushes in the fetus; and instructs the woman to contract until the fetus emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus hangs laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	He will set the hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman, and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If he cannot walk, then make him lie on a bed and shake his legs with a strong concussion.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the liniment which you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she receives it in childbirth, then make her sit on a stool.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study in the reduction of the hand, and equal fetus according to the natural form: and make her sneeze, and command her to compress herself, until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus emerges from its mother's womb with its arms outstretched and its face toward its mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife must grasp the fetus with her hand, then gradually turn it and make it even with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When therefore it is made equal, then place upon its surface what we have recounted from oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then direct him to be moved gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When therefore you have done that, then make her sit upon a seat, and command her to incline to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then order him to compress it: and make him sneeze with the condiment.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The prepared fetus is placed on its side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the opening of the womb in this way with the second instrument, then cut the second instrument with your finger until it is evacuated from moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it is suspended over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it may not be retained, and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then drive the fetus inward until you place it as is necessary: and command the woman to compress herself several times; for he will himself emerge by the light exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or of many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins often are born, and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	Nevertheless, this is foreign and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	There are five things outside of nature, and they do not live at all: and it contains them, even if they multiply, according to one: and they are separated by a siphon, distinguishing between them the ligament in the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they emerge like one fetus from the natural exit, easily; and they emerge through the praiseworthy exit, as we have recounted.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of these things should prove difficult during childbirth, and they come to that which we said from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have narrated: and let the midwife be subtle, and do what she does with ease and delay, and devise according to every figure with that which is prepared for her from skillful guidance to safety.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder of what is formed in the womb from embryos and miscarriages.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has now been verified to me that a woman, aborting, emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	What has been done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, this whole thing ought to be in the science of midwifery.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will come upon that one similar to this: let him therefore oppose it with what is fitting.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the division of medicine, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then it is necessary for you to consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound virtue, and is not with any of those accidents, for which destruction fears her: then it ought that the woman be laid upon the bed, upon her back, and let her head be inclined downwards, and her legs elevated: and let the minister hold her by two parts, or be tied to the bed, so that her body may not be pulled out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the womb's bone with wet oils together with althea mucus and fennel seeds and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and ointments: then let her insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then he should seek out a place where he can insert hooks from the fetus and suitable locations for it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider therefore then, if the fetus is prepared to descend over its head: then fix hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its clavicle, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypogastrium.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If the descent is upon his feet, then in the hip bone and middle ribs of him.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that he hold the hook with his right hand and place its curve into that which is between the fingers of his left hand and introduce it with his hand easily and fix the hook in one of those places which we have said, until it comes to the empty thing.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he places another hook, or a third one if needed, opposite it, so that the contraction is equal and does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it shall be extended with an equal extension, and let the extension not be according to straightness alone, but rather moved to every part, so that the exit of it may be relieved; as is done with a tooth when it is being eradicated.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary that in what is between them, it be softened extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part is retained from that, then it is necessary for the midwife to anoint some fingers with oil and insert them from the side, so that she may turn what is retained with them.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then let the hooks be changed to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus emerges.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand emerges before other things, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction: then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then remove it until it comes out entirely, cut it either at the joint of the foot or at the elbow: and thus you ought to do with your other hand and both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If, however, the head of the fetus is large, or there is a constriction at its exit, or there is water collected in its head: then it is necessary that he insert between the fingers the Spatumile spinosum, and find it with the head, and extract the water: or break it with an instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, let him do if the fetus has a large head, then it is necessary that he cut the afterbirth; or take him out with forceps, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If it protrudes from the head and is drawn together at the fork, then it should be held until the moisture in the chest is expelled.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it is not complicated, nor does it submit to an exit: then cut off the head piecemeal, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If a boil or dropsy is in the lower abdomen, then it should be pierced until the moisture flows out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If however the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the maternal orifice is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If it is bound near the abdomen or chest: then it is necessary that you extract it with the cloth which you have wrapped over your hand: and bind the abdomen, or chest, until what is in them heals.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns, then the midwife will insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the maternal opening is open, then he shall insert his hand into the depths of the womb, and with it seek the head, and draw it with his fingers up to the maternal opening; then he shall insert one hook or two hooks into it, and draw it with that.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mother's bone is constricted, because of a hot abscess that happens to it; then it should not be labored over, rather it should administer an effusion of humid and fatty things; and apply plasters; and sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible for it to be made equal; then that which we said regarding a living fetus should be administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then it shall be cut in pieces and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not let anything out of the second bowel at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about hot abscesses that occur in wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If bleeding occurs, then let it descend into styptic water and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have seen a woman who had a dead fetus in her womb; then she became pregnant again over it, and afterwards another fetus died as well.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, after a long time an abscess occurred to him in his navel, and it swelled until it opened; and he began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore called upon to treat him, and I treated him for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore, I placed over it some strong drawing plasters: and out of the place bone came.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then after several days another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore amazed that there is no mouth in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought therefore, because they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	Therefore I investigated the wound, and extracted many bones, a woman being in better dispositions of her own. And now she has lived such as this for a long time, and sends out a little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not set this foreign thing down, unless because there is science in it, and help for that which the physician-craftsman administers with his hand from healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of instruments necessary in extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the shape of the  Strictor, which books are equated to, which have two whorls on both ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this vertigo ought to be a more refined constriction, and it should be made, either from ebony or from boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the width of the whole piece of wood be like two fingers; and the margin of each of both be like one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fastened on both sides, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of both is like two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are put into the opening of the womb, so that it may open with them when you revolve two whorls.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of dizziness when the womb opens.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to this, more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Make it out of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	Nevertheless at the end of it there should be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of the whole addition from them is like a palm: and the width of both is, two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When therefore you wish to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit upon a bed, with her feet hanging down, and that which is between her legs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two adjuncts joined into the uterus: and you are holding the lower extremity of the instrument between his hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with an instrument, as you do with forceps, evenly according to the quantity that you wish from the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Form of Vertigo of another kind which ancients called Form of the Driving Force by which the fetus is driven.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of an Almisdac, which is used to crush the large head: and it is similar to a forceps, which has teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made oblong, like forceps according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like saw teeth, with which one cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of a small head crush.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of a wound having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The shape of a two-spined wrench.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The shape of a forceps with serrated teeth, with which the head of a fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The shape of a spatula has two extremities for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two spatulas also called probes.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are practiced, and the more their kinds multiply, and they are prepared by the craftsman, the faster it is to operation, and the higher among men, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not disregard from them an instrument, that it may be prepared with you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	It is indeed an inexcusable necessity of theirs.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the extraction of the Second (tooth) .
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When Secondina is retained at childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the weak one so that she may retain her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make him sneeze with the condiment: and hold your hand over his mouth, and his nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it comes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take an olla, and pierce a hole in the bottom of it: and put in it herbs that open the womb, such as  mallow, rue, anethum, chamomile, sage, cassia twig, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them on the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a reed bandage over the opening of the pot's handle, and the other end into the mother’s womb: and hold it until steam reaches the concavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For Secondinus will go forth with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then order the Midwife to submerge her hand in sesame oil, or thick alum.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then he inserts into the wound and seeks with it the second layer.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore he has found it, then let him take it and extend it gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If it is attached deep within the womb, then he shall insert his hand, according to what we have narrated, until he finds the Secundina and extracts it gradually along a straight line, so that the womb does not fall upon violent pulling: indeed, it ought to be moved with ease to the right and left sides; then add to the quantity of the traction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it then obeys, and is preserved, and departs from adherence.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the maternal bone is contracted, as we have already narrated: care for it with sneezing and from the treatment of a pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then beware of tiring it beyond measure in the repetition of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that what exits from the mouth of the womb be brought to the hip of the woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then administer an enema with ointment of four drugs.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For indeed it will rot it after days, and it will dissolve, and it will come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it rots, a bad smell arises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, it is necessary that appropriate fumigations be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients already experienced fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	Form of the instrument for fumigating a woman during the retention of the Second and menstrual flow.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Make a wick like incense from glass or wax: and place the wide end over the fire: and let fumigation be placed over prunes: hold it until the fumigation is consumed: and repeat another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their anus is not perforated, whom already subtil sifac has cured.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that sifac with her finger; and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp Spatula; and she should beware of the laceration, so that it does not touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If you fear that it should be filled, then put a lead pipe into the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to heal.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now it happens that a suppuration of the anus also occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore it is necessary that this consolidation be cut, then it should be treated with what we have said regarding treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower part are a Knot and Lumps that occur near the anus of the opening: or in the space of one part: and it is one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that Knot becomes obsolete, it is opened and a watery moisture, white, or a subtle pus runs out of it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these are penetrating fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, they are recognized as penetrating through that which comes out from defecation and windiness, when the sick person uses defecation: and perhaps it comes out of them worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are among these fistulas when they are in penetrating space up to the bladder, and up to the male organ's passage.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And some of them penetrate as far as the hip joint, and as far as the tail bone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this it is known that a fistula penetrating to the anus, even if not penetrating, is so that you introduce your index finger into the anus: and introduce a thin probe into the fistula from bronze or iron; when there is no twist.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is a twisting in it, then introduce into it a thin lead probe, or a shaft made of horsehair, until you feel the probe, or the shaft in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it completely, and nothing comes out of the hole by discharge, nor windiness, nor worm as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when a fistula is penetrating to the bladder, or to the passage of urine: then its meaning is the exit of urine from it, and its prohibition so that this place may be solidified with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it penetrates up to the joint of the hip, or to the bone of the hip: then the sign of it is that the touch reaches there, if there is no tortuosity up to the bone; and the finding of pain around the part, and that pus issues from it always; and that medicine does not avail in it, nor does it solidify with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their treatment is labor and vanity to him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that which is not penetrating and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a suture, according to what I tell you, and I have already proven it: and it is, as the sick person lies between your hands on his back: and raise his legs up to his hips, and let his hips be inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then they introduce lead, or air, if there is a twisting in the fistula, until you know where the probe arrives.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, he feels her weak around the anus, then it is necessary that you introduce your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel in your finger that something has already penetrated itself, besides what you feel between your finger and the skin, or flesh; then certainly know that it is penetrating; do not therefore labor on it, because it is not its healing, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said, however, that in some people flesh heals and from the medication which is hoped to be helpful, it is as if fine cauteries are applied according to the width of the fistula, as was previously stated, and you introduce this ignited into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat this twice, or three times, until you know that all those added and filtered meats which are like the quill of a bird’s feather have been burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for it with cloths wrapped in butter, until those burned meats come out; then care for it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it is never healed with any other cure.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it emerges (the probe) and does not reach your finger, which is in the anus, and there is a thick layer between it and the probe, either of flesh or of cicatrix: and you see a fistula in what follows the skin surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go cutting with the probe that is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the probe's extremity reaches, and the probe is freed and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then purify those filtered meats which are similar to the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If blood conquers you, and loosens between you and your operation so that you cut those flesh, then it is better, and of swifter help, to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because a cautery with fire gathers good properties, the burning of those added flesh tissues, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying out of moistures.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then the wound is treated with linens wrapped in butter or crushed cabbage until it discharges pus and the charred flesh comes out into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care is taken of the wound once it has been consolidated with ointment that produces hard flesh; and there are medicines in which there is astringency and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are restored, then it is healed and you should not fear a repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however a fistula has already reached deep into the anus, and extends from the excess of the body: then introduce your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a wound, and between you and it is a covering of silk or flesh, and it is near to penetration; then there is no operation in that, except according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because it is administered in one of three ways: either that you cauterize it, as we have said; or that you cut it until you find its concavity so that it is possible for you to introduce a ligature and cure from close by.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the cutting, so that you do not cut the ligament holding back the anus, and that it happens over the weak exit of excretion without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of it as we said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will heal: or you may lengthen the bandage, and cleanse it after drying it nearly to the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or with some other instrument having a sharp extremity.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then purify those filtered flesh that are in the incision, as far as you can with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt restoration of the entire wound with a section and an upper opening where it closes; and let there remain an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter on the weak side.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes a fistula is treated in this way: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with the skin and edge of the anus: then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like an awl, that is, prepared leather, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into it a thread wrapped from five threads, and about it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then introduce a probe with a thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it is penetrating in the margin of the anus inwardly near, then extract the thread from that hole: so that you may introduce your finger into the anus, and draw out the end of the thread, and gather together the two ends simultaneously: and tighten both, and release it on one day, or two days: and as much as the thread sinks into the flesh, tighten it well, until those fleshes which are between the two extremities of the thread sink in, and fall: then take care of the wound, until it consolidates, and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in any way that you prepare for yourself, unless it is deep within.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not fitting for you to do that because of the cut so that you do not cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then make with it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of a knife for cutting into the spine where a fistula is found, whose cure is very acute, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the suture of hemorrhoids from which blood runs after incision, and care for fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are inside the anus, like pieces of charcoal or plums: or as if they were grains of a grape.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And of these there are small ones and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are, for the most part, few in moisture, of which runs yellow water or little blood with a steady flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure of this which is within the anus, is that you instruct the sick person to fart, and expel it until it comes out of the anus, and appears to you white.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, also suspend with hooks: or hold them with your finger.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they are not held by the hooks because of their moisture and softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a wad made of double wool fleece, and remove them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and pulverize upon them after the incision some hot powders, so that they may stand in their place as cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not obey defecation, then a clyster should be administered to the sick person in which there is a small bite, so that it may wash what is in the anus and obey defecation quickly when the sick person expels himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If they are external from the anus, then their condition is light and easy; and it is as if you would take them with your fingernail or hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with that which we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And if he shuns cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer a suture of them according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a thread wound up, and introduce it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw the athil upward and make it penetrate with a point at its root from the other side: and involve the two extremities of the thread, in the lower part of the awl, and let them be laterally placed: and tighten the athil tightly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread, and draw out the point.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all aethile and release from them one: and do not let its own, so that it runs out of excess blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth soaked in rose or red oil over the anus, and place it over the anus. And command the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let it go, until it falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the athelia fall, treat them with ointment, and the rest of treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the care of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Many times indeed they happen from drying of excrement and constraint of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they are ancient and medicine does not avail in them, then it is necessary that you cut with points of a spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper cortex which prevents them from consolidation be removed from them.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them until they are consolidated as is proper.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not solidify, then treat them again with greater vigor than before, until they bleed much and are scraped, and then take care of them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted  Almirmar, and Athelil ulcers, and Formicae.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs in the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet, and fingers: and pain happens from them when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore it is necessary that what is around the nail be cut and held with forceps or a hook, and be removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for that: and if you wish cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From the armpit there is one small, rough, filtered eminence, round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And many times they happen in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is, that you extend athelil and cut it; or bind it with silk thread; or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now the athelil are eradicated, both inverted and not inverted with the instrument which I shall tell you about.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A bite from an ant is also a small elevation, rough, on the surface of the body, penetrating deep down; and when it finds cold, it feels like an ant bite in it, and happens throughout the body; and most of it happens in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its cure is, that you take a tube from the feather of a goose, or the feather of a strong vulture: and put that tube over the Formica, until it contains a circle of the tube from its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with a probe until you cut what is around the ant's form; and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, make it with a tube of air, or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the tube be drawn up to a height so that the grip on the finger is lessened and its turning made easier.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish to cauterize a  Formica according to what was previously said in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	On the shapes of instruments which are administered to the urethra in affections of the anus, and the loosening of the belly, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or brass, or cast or hammered copper.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore that which is administered in the care of very young boys, let it be small; and of those whose anuses are weak, or painful, so also their testicles.
Clistere magnum.	Large clyster.
Cistere paruum.	Small bladder.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The tube of it, that is, the upper part in which the uterus is tied, should be wide according to this method: and let there be a distinction so that the uterus can be tied as you see, and its lower end which goes into the anus, should be closed, that is, not open, soft, smooth, gently pulling towards fineness: and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the foramen be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker, and let it be in which medicines are put from the bladder of an animal: or from sheepskin, which is according to the form of a small asophore: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it shall be pierced with many holes as it is turned, and let the space that is between every hole be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then introduce into those openings a strong thread of raw thread, which is made of ten threads, or about that many, and gather it with it the uterus like an asofratus.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore it is placed in it, let it be tightened at the head with a clyster between two distinguishing constrictions with strong force.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then give a clyster with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle of the womb here depicted, and the hole.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of cleansing with this, is: that you fill the rectum, or bladder with medicine, which should be heated according to the amount tolerated by the patient: and beware that it is not too hot, or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient is laid on his back and his legs are raised to the upper part; and beneath him a cushion, that is, skin upon which men lie, or cloth, is placed.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the extremity with oil, or with egg white, or with flaxseed mucilage, or the like.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant take the rectum with both his hands and press it forcefully until everything that is in the clyster is evacuated into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the clyster and have the patient raise his legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If medicine compels him to an outcome, then let him hold as much as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it throughout the whole night, it is more helpful.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If, however, you give him enemas in complaints of belly disease, and his death hastens, then repeat the enemas until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then a fine, gentle enema should be used, like those with which children are cleaned.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of a thin enema for when the skin is tight.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the healing of wounds of the head without fracture of bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have said in the division of the cure of wounds what was convenient for the book, and I will say here the cure of them with hand and with medicines according to complement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore I say, that wounds differ according to the manner in which they are inflicted, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things therefore by which wounds are made very often are such as a throw of a stone: or incision with a sword, or knife: or striking with a spear, or wood, or arrow: and similar things from many others.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that are made according to the location of the body are such as a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or leg; and similar ones from those limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am relating cures of certain wounds, so that I may place that reasoning and rule over the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I begin with simple wounds of the head: for the recollection of compositions will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	Therefore, I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no bone fracture: consider then, if it is from a stone throw, or something similar, and it has only broken the skin: and the wound is large, and you fear an outcome of hot suppuration: then make haste, and perform cephalic phlebotomy immediately: and do not delay this: and draw out blood according to the quantity of its power: if nothing forbids phlebotomy, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the incision be made on the opposite side from the wound.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick one beware of repletion, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If something prevents reduction, then it should be lessened from food, and it should not approach meats, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And put over the wound if it happens to him a hot abscess, apply a decoction infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are sure about the hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent with its own blood, and has not yet changed its air, the powder which I shall tell you a little later: and if it has already changed its air, then place upon it some ointment until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If, however, the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar: and its lips do not come together by means of pins, then gather them together with suture, according to what I will say about wounds of the abdomen regarding their sutures.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If now the wound is already discovered from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspensory: then cut into it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore in it the hard flesh in the place of skin, and order the sick person to be fed with foods which are thick, such as heads, and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge; and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find in the skin rotting, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut out the whole rotten part, and throw it away; then care for it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it is not cut off by medicines, then investigate above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not cut, then cut it with a spatula, or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity requires when that which we said does not help, then cauterize it until the blood is cut off.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however these wounds are small, simple, then the matter of them is easy, light: so that you put this powder on them: because it consolidates them before they change in air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The Method of Incarnate Powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of olibanum, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburnt chalk: mix all together well and sift it.  Fill the wound with this and bind it tightly with a good bandage until it adheres well to it and clots with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it above with pads and let it go, and do not loosen it while it remains so that it does not come undone.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes it does this alone the plaster, when you do not have frankincense at hand, and dragon's blood also does the same operation in many of the large wounds, when it is convenient to be laid upon them and bound tight, and are fresh wounds with their own blood, which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If it has already been altered by some kind of change, especially when it is in the summer time, then there is no intention for this powder to be in position: therefore take care of it with what we have said, so that you put some ointments on it which are digestive; or put poultices on it made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it happens with a wound and fracture in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with the Gesti: and I will now say the cure of fractures of the head in what will come next.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	On Wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a wound on the head when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If a vein of the neck or an artery has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no power in it unless it be treated with that which makes staunching vehement, such as ziniar and zegi and things similar.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm the nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything cold at all upon the wound: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most sublime part of the body: and let it be cured by medicines gently, such as chalk washed with sweet water several times infused with oil, or with rose oil, and thyme, when it is also washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If however the wound is large, then administer a suture: or constrict its lips with little bits of wool.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If, however, the depth of the wound is great, or a sinus has occurred in the lower part of it, in which pus is already gathered, then pierce it in the more depressed place within it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If an artery has already been cut in a wound and its blood flow has continued, then separate or dry it out, and tie it up: or cauterize it if necessity requires it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If however the wound has occurred in the throat, or all of it, and the al-hadege have been saved: then gather together the lips of skin with suture above the tube of the throat, and do not touch the throat, but rather equalize it, and bring it back to its natural form.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten it with a suitable ligature and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment which contains astringency and drying power, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on bone, then examine it: and if there are fragments of bone in it, remove them all, or as many as you can.  And what cannot be prepared, let it alone until the wound decays, and its exit is separated and relieved.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then apply the powder I have described upon it.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If, however, a bone appears in the wound and a fistula is formed, then care for it should be taken with that which is remembered in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On a wound in the shoulder blades.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore from a wound there issues windiness, when he gasps from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is fresh with its own blood, then you shall not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it tightly so that blood is not held in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the patient: but place ointment attractant upon it, and loosen it every day twice.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If, however, ointment is not present to you, then place in the opening of the wound old cloth, so that it may draw out that which flows from it of humidities: and make that the sick person sleep upon the wound, so that it may cure what is gathered in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If now three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasm has occurred in the infirm, nor a bad tremor of the heart, nor stricture in breathing, and you see the rest of its dispositions good: then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore care for it itself and with licenses, and the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If, however, healing is excused, and it always opens then you shall know that a fistula has been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore care for it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what preceded concerning suture, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If however he has already made an impression on the bone, and a fragment has fallen out of it: then inquire about the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If they are not separated, then leave them until the wound has rotted, for extraction will be made easier.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment of the accidents of wounds in the remaining limbs is in the cure, as we said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	On wounds of the abdomen, and the exit of the intestines, and their protrusion.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	A rupture that happens to the belly, is great, and medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore sometimes a great quantity of intestine emerges, or a number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, the introduction of them is made, and their suture more difficult and strenuous.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And even a small rupture can be difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore it follows that the reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten in its introduction to its place immediately; because it becomes inflated, opened, and enlarged; therefore the entrance into it becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, a middle disruption is better for ruptures because with it, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two kinds.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that suture of the vagina is done in four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are used in the suture of the abdomen and in the suture of other wounds on the body; and two other sutures are proper to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	Nevertheless, these are more appropriate for stitching up a wound in the abdomen: and I will tell you each one with explanation and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	Therefore I say, that when a wound is small, and something comes out of it from the intestines, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then it is because of one of two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we have said; or because there is inflation in the intestine because of the coldness of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore that is so, then it is necessary that you heat it, so that you may submerge a sponge, or a piece of cloth wet in lukewarm water only.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with squill and cypress and saffron and embrocations with the intestine until the swelling resolves.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes it makes a wine with astringency; and it is better than water alone in resolving swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see that the swelling has already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which the althea or marshmallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For that, the entrance is eased with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, his return is excused after this treatment, then find in a small incision, with the instrument by which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared than when it is cut; and there should not be compulsion to cut after necessity and lack of instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let there be a part of it that is twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the fine extremity not be with the fineness of Spatula, but rather be somewhat blunt: and it is that which resembles a spatula, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore a wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary that there be a reduction of it according to its natural form in its own place, if it is possible above it: because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When a rupture is wide in the lower part of the abdomen: then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place its head and chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your attention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which is the wound be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds, and in medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then have a devout assistant present between your hands who will hold the entire rupture with his hand: and bring together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then uncover from it he who follows the suture something after something: and this is the manner of a common suture of one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the end of the rupture the quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the doctor: and fix one point with an awl, besides which you insert a thread into both extremities of the skin, with both extremities of the fascia that is under the skin from the interior, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already gathered together two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the fascia: and there are four rows.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then bind with a double thread around the area of the needle several times from two sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are joined together by a decent gathering.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the thickness of a finger also, and set in them another point; afterward bind it with thread, as you did with the first point.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore, do not cease doing this with it as you need from the awl until you complete the constriction of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the awls be of medium thickness between coarseness and fineness; for fine awls cut flesh very quickly, and coarse ones are difficult to enter the skin: therefore they ought to be of medium thickness and fineness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be inserted in both extremities of the adjacent skin too much; so that flesh does not quickly cut, and the wound opens before its consolidation, and also do not lengthen with suture, so that the wound is not hindered from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the extremity of the needle so that it does not harm the sick person in their sleep; and place small pieces of cloth on every side of them, which hold the extremities of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Since one or two or about that many needles suffice for sewing them up.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second kind of suture is common, as it joins the extremities with four sutures: two extremities of skin and two extremities of fascia in one vice, with a needle in which sits an equal thread in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have penetrated with the point these four extremities, withdraw the point from the part where you began, so that the thread may fall from the upper part of the wound: that it may be a suture, as a suture of cloth which is tightened on cloth, and place between each suture the quantity of thickness less than the smallest finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	These stitches men know.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I treated the wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was a rupture one palm wide: and about two palms of intestine had come out from the middle intestine, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Therefore, after it stood outside the wound for twenty-four hours, I reduced it.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	Therefore, the wound was consolidated in a space which was about fifteen days: and I took care of it, and it healed: and he lived after it for many years, unchanged in his habits.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that it would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no ointment was found, nor anything from medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	Therefore I placed upon the old ulcer a poultice twice a day, and diligently washed it with water of honey until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I shall speak of two kinds of suture proper according to the account of discourse.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, as you begin with a sharp suture: and insert the point from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore a needle penetrates the skin and entering the flesh according to the length and width of the whole body: let go the extremity of the sifac on the side in which you introduced the needle, and make it penetrate into the other extremity from the inner part to the outer in the other extremity.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extremity miraculous from the outside part to the inside: and let go the extremity sifac, which is in this side, and make it penetrate the point into the other extremity from the inside part to the outside: and make it penetrate with penetration your own that you make it penetrate in sifac extremity miraculous, which is in its part, until it penetrates into the whole of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the extremity which is from the opposite side, and extract the point from the skin which has pierced through.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then bring it back into that skin, and suture its end, which is on the other side, with this end marvelously; and draw it out of the skin which is on its part, and make one of them, and the other; and make one after another, until its entire outside according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture is that you sew with sutures of softer skin than these skins; so that you stitch one side of one extremity of the skin and let it go on the other side until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of suture, which Gale called his own.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech of his is narrated so that he would imitate it according to the likeness with which some physicians do this, that they gather all the part to its own part fitting by nature: and they apply the end sifac to its other end, and the end mirach to its other end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you place a pointed knife at the edge of the limb near you from the outside part, and make it penetrate to the inside there: and let go of the two ends of the knife.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the point and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner in two extremities, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both sides, even make them penetrate from the inside to the outside, into two extreme parts, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is a better suture than the common one, and it is a suture whose previous explanation has been given.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also the speech of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the abdomen should be made with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, to introduce into both one thread: and begin with the introduction of a needle, from that which is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew skins equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when a rupture is in the middle of the belly: then its suture is more difficult than the rest of the places of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of healing a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you find a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it: and you reduce the intestine, and your own, and fit it: then place on top powdered charcoal.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already changed the wound: then put on it some ointment which is present to you, until they make pus, and the threads fall away, and the wound be closed up, and healed.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as is the treatment of other wounds until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If medicines are not present to you, then put upon it immediately, from where it begins to discharge pus, a poultice of old, rotten cloth; and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medication in many cases when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If you fear that a wound may communicate to the principal members in the lesion, then it is necessary that you submerge soft wool in oil tempered with moderate heat, or in rose oil: and place it around the areas which are between the groins, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, or pricks, or putrefaction in his bowels (for this often happens), then cleanse him with wine, thick, black, lukewarm: especially if the rot has already reached the intestine and made an exit passing through to its hollow cavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing, and that which is from those [parts] is of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine called the jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that happens in it at all; and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and proximity of its nature to nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If what comes from the wound is a protrusion, and you find it fresh: reduce it according to your method of reduction, by which you reduce intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If however the space has passed and it is already green or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with a thread above the place which has darkened from it, so that there does not happen a flow of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	In the finger are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and put two hanging ends of thread from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the traction of it above you may be relieved, and its extraction in case of zirbi, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	A remembrance of a wound that happened in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When rupture occurs in the intestine and is small, it is possible that it may be restored in some people; for I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a lance thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old; and a fistula was made, and wind and excrement came out of it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore I made treatment, until I was not confident in his healing: and I did not cease to treat him carefully, until he was healed, and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw that the place was already consolidated, I feared for the weak part, lest an evil accident happen to the weak part in his belly; and it did not happen to him from that evil accident.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better dispositions of himself, eating and drinking, and going to the bathroom, and entered the bath, and exercised on his diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now some experimenters have said that when a wound happens in the intestine and is small, then it ought to be bound up according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, as you receive ants of great heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place a single ant that has an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore he seizes it above and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres, and does not separate.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease doing this with an ant after each ant according to the quantity of the whole wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it and sew its wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For these heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, so that no harm is done to the weak person entirely.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible to draw out the intestines even with a fine thread: which has been removed from the animal's intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into the wound.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, so that you receive the extremity of this thread from the gut, and it be much cleaned.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then bind a thread of fine linen wrapped at the end of it.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce that thread into the point and sew with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then bring it back to its break.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this way of suturing with ants and intestine is nothing but according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound that is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, then there is no remedy except subtlety, and its healing is not at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	On the treatment of a Zochen (or possibly Zychemen) and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound, or abscess when it ages and becomes old, and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and always emits pus, and is not cut off: then it is called universally in any member a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula indeed is according to truth a knot filtered, hard, white: with which there is no pain, which has the concavity of a bird's feather: and because of this some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And there are some hours humid, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps moisture divides in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this humidity is much and little, and is thick and subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already stated in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal and no flesh is born in it, this is not due to anything but one new cause.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of these is, or because of the small amount of blood in the body; or because of its evil; or because between itself and above its lips is hard flesh, preventing the birth of flesh; or because it is full of dirt and filth; or because the ulcer on itself is putrid, and the matter that is sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment; or because the corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence; or by the property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which difficult digestion of diseases occurs, and the healing of abscesses is delayed by nature; or because it has one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have now shown all these causes and signs of them, and their cures with medicines in division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore that a fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For some of these are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or fascia; or to the intestine, or bladder, or to one of the ribs; or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the joints formed by a composition: such as hands and feet; and from these there are some that reach the proximity of the main member and similar members.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, those fistulas according to this manner are from difficult diseases to heal, and do not receive treatment, and occupation with them is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from a fistula of which the depth does not reach these places which I have said: and you hope and trust in its cure, and you wish to come to know it, then take a probe made of copper, or iron, if the fistula extends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is a tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead, with the softness of its body, is raised and bent around a twist.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If a fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to feel over it with your finger.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, a clyster is administered from them through their openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For humidity which you use for douching it enters through other openings and flows out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully inquire in whatever way is possible to you, so that you may know whether there is a bone or a nerve, and whether the fistula's concavity is distant or close: or whether it is one fistula which has many openings, and stand upon all of it with your utmost strength. With your questioning, as you interrogate the sick person, and by finding pain upon compression with your hand over the place, and by similar signs and accidental causes of the abscess.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When therefore you stand upon all these true stations, then go to cure according to confidence: and it is, as you consider then, if there is a Fistula near appearing, or in a healthy place far from the joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then dry the Fistula according to what was said before from my narration, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupt flesh, which is born in its opening from flesh, or pus, and similar things: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If however a fistula is of great depth and is straight, then it is necessary to cut it deep as far as you are able.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it thoroughly of all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer a linen cloth rolled up in sharp medicines: and introduce it as far as the cavity of the fistula which you have grasped with iron: do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes everything that remains in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal through that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If therefore the cause of a fistula is bone, and you certify this to yourself; then examine that bone, and dry it according to what I have told you; if nothing prevents you from a vein, or nerve, or principal limb, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore a bone is discovered by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until the whole corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with that which has become incorporated into him, until he is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal, and discharge pus as it did: then you know that you have not come to the complete eradication of corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore diligently cleanse it a second time, and make an exact reason of it, and its purification with your utmost fortitude.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If therefore it heals, it is good: and if not, then know that that corruption is in the deep part of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	There is therefore no need for you to have ingenuity in it, unless you let nature take care of it.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If a small bone is broken, and it is possible for you, draw it together with fine forceps that are suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then make a very careful traction of them all, and do not let anything escape from them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If something from the moist things does harm to you, and there is no fear or error in cutting them: then cut those moist things and the flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If you do not have the preparation to remove the bones from your hour, then place over the wound that it may rot; and let it be until it has rotted what is around those bones from flesh and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not close up.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And tighten the section which you cut in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	If you wish, place on top of it a cloth submerged in sulfur ground with oil; or a cloth submerged in Egyptian ointment; or some ointment of viridarium.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humidities decay and the bones separate from them, the removal of them is eased, and their drawing out.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If it is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg or the bone of the hip, and similar to these, and if that which has become corrupted from it is a large part: then carefully cut away the last part, until the black and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If however what is in it is corrupted, and the part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close it up and cut it entirely until the place where the corruption has arrived: then take care of it until it solidifies.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you a wound which happened to a man in his leg: that you may put it as an example and help to your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man about thirty years of age to whom pain occurred in his leg, caused by something that moved into him from within the body, that is, from the insides, until the matter reached the leg, and it became a large abscess: and there was no external cause for him.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, time was extended with him in error of physicians, until an abscess was opened, and many materials converged with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after treatment had been applied, until the leg was healed and many openings were made in it which all discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of hands until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the matter that flowed from those openings in great flow: also all the body of the man had become wasted, and its color was yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings and it reached the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings, and found that they communicated with each other from all parts of the thigh.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I therefore proceeded and cut above one of the openings until I discovered the part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already corroded and blackened, and rotten, and perforated until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Therefore I have seen what was shown to me, and prepared from a corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I determined that there should not be in the bone except for that corruption, which was cut away and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines over a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it is not united.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I examined and found above the bone, second to the first detection, a continuous decay with the bone, and I sawed what appeared to me even from that decay.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it has not been restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore I examined it again and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and attempt its restoration: and it was not restored until I cut out of the bone about one palm's length, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed; and this repetition in his operation and section was not necessary except because of the disposition of weakness of the sick man, and the smallness of his tolerance, and my fear over him about death; for he fell into syncopes every hour from the excess of evacuation.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore he was healed with complete healing: and flesh hard as bone was born in the place of the bone, and a good arrangement was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he turned back to his arrangements: and he did no harm whatsoever to him in walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If however the prominent bone in the place of the body has already been broken: then it is necessary that you fasten it, according to this manner: and it is: that you take a ligament, and tighten it at the extremity of the prominent bone: and order someone, who extends it upwards: and put another ligament out of wool thicker than the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it upon the flesh which is under the bone: and extend the extremity of it, so that you draw the flesh downward: and you will expose the flesh over the place which you wish to suture, so that it does not wound the flesh with the saw.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood, or a board beneath the bone in a central location; for when you do this, it does not prevent the cutting of rotten flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that there be a lock on the place corrupted for a short time, so that there may not be corruption in the concavity of the bone, and it may not appear in its appearance to the sense, and it may force to the lock itself vice another.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is broken and not protruding, rather its part continues with another part, and the break is in the middle of it, or in a part of it, then cover the flesh from all parts entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the lower stick.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards, saw it from the first part, where there is corruption, until the saw continues on the other part: and let the saw be according to the length from the corruption a little, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If corruption is in a joint, cut open the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If a corruption is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no remedy in it except scraping.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If corruption is in the breast of the hand, or in the breast of the foot: then the matter in it is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But truly you ought to inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And having scraped it and cleaned it according to whatever arrangement you can manage, and with whatever ingenuity you correct it for you: when it does not make opposition to you Vein, or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that saws and cutting instruments for cutting these bones are many, according to the location of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and fineness, and size, and smallness, and hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that you prepare instruments suitable for each kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you concerning the kind of instrument with which you will have need when it is with you a long study.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the modes of this art is a testimony to the modes of diseases: for then indeed you will find by yourself that which is suitable for each illness from instruments.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will place examples upon which you will cut, and a trial which you will try on others.
Forma Serrae.	Shape of the Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This depiction of the saw is made well.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its arch be superior, its sharpness from iron; and its handle from boxwood, and let it be pyramidal in form made off-center.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the surgical knife for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this rasp be according to the form of the head of a star-shaped key: and its points be according to the form of the punctures of elischetfegi.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not fitting unless they are rubbed with it, heads of joints, when they rot or a bone is wide and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Form of the Larger Scalpel
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the middle scalpel.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Form of a Broad Scalpel.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Shape of the razor in which there is a concave side.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Form of another fine razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The shape of a razor for another curved extremity.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The shape of the razor is small and fine.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of a saw with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The form also of a large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a chisel, and its extremity is like a saw: it is used in many places for cutting bone.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of a scalpel which is suitable for its use according to the way it has been perforated from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	The extremity of it is triangular, and acute at its extremities.
Fit ex Indi.	It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly it is necessary that all things which we have said be done from Razors, and Cutters, and Saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the incision of limbs, and the setting of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy, either from an external cause, or from an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated that corruption with medicines, and the treatment does not help: and you see the corruption has affected the limb, which is not struck by anything: then it is necessary that you cut into that limb until where the corruption follows, so that the sick man may escape through it from death, or from the evil which is greater defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of this happening is that the limb darkens until it is thought to be burned by fire or rotting after blackness: until that rot reaches what follows that limb, and spreads throughout the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, it is proper with the cutting of it, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the striking of some venomous ones: such as the scorpion of the sea, and viper, and adder, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore decay or a blow is in the extremity of the finger, then cut the finger, and do not make space for decay, that it may proceed to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root of the finger, and do not leave space for corruption until it takes hold in the arm's focus.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it strikes him there, then cut the arm at the elbow at its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however corruption passes through and you see him about the arm: then there is death of the sick man in that.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And in addition to that from healing, is the quantity of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do so with the foot, when corruption invades the finger, then cut it at one of the joints: and if it seizes in the arch of the foot, then cut the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If corruption has already come above the knee, then there is no remedy except dismissal, and to leave the sick person to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way of cutting a limb, or sewing it up is, that you tie one ligament below the place you wish to cut. And tie another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let one assistant extend a ligament downwards: and let another assistant extend a ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the whole flesh is uncovered.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then cut, or suture.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you place a linen cloth from all parts, and let the saw not touch the healthy place: and may there happen to the wounded one an added lesion and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If a hemorrhage occurs internally while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly: or put some powders on it that stop blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and care for it until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same thing that I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is because a blackness occurred in his foot, when it was burned and assimilated to the burning of fire; and that corruption first occurred in his finger, until it began the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore a man healed himself after he saw that corruption had fallen upon the limb with violence, which he found from the pain and burning of it: and it fell upon him at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption befell his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He then came to me, and I tried to recover that superfluity with what I had placed on his hand from medicines after the purification of his body: and the superfluity was not found, and it began to walk into another finger; until corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	Therefore he called me to cut his hand: and I was unwilling, hoping for a surplus of his recovery from me: and I also feared about him death at the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the man's virtue was above the wound.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After that, when he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it came to me about him, because he hurried, and fell with his whole hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not brought forth this narrative, except that it may be an aid regarding that which falls under the genus of this ailment: and that it may be a sign by which it is made known, and according to which it is treated.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the care of sinuses, and the quality of clysters with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter XC.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When a boil occurs in certain fleshy limbs and the space of the boil is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts or is perforated, and what is in it of pus comes out, and a hollow place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is above it like a cloth that has already been finely woven: and does not reach the ultimate stage of corruption, nor presses into bone, nor into nerve, nor into ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: however, if its space is prolonged until corruption presses into any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the care of it is that you cut that skin entirely as it revolves; and especially when it has been smoothed out and made like cloth; and trust that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If you hope that it will adhere to the skin, and last corruption does not follow from this; and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then care for it with a clyster, and it is, as you should consider, to the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	If it is large, and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor: then cleanse it with an Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, they are gathered in a vessel; and they are boiled over a fire until the medicine boils; and it comes to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what is necessary for you; and dissolve it with water and honey, and administer a clyster into the sinus with it. And bind the opening of it, and let the medicine remain in it for the quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then remove it with expression: do this for so many days until the sinus is purified and the stench is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is given as a suppository with ash water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is, that you take the ash of willow wood or ash from holly trees; and pour it upon the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then treat it with a suppository, and give a clyster with it, until you are confident that the sinus has been emptied.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or water of ash, then cleanse him with water and honey to which has been mixed something of crushed zinc.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or cleanse it with a clyster of honey and wine mixed together, because the property of honey is to purify and wash; and wine causes the wound to adhere, especially when there is an abundance of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this several times, and you trust that the corruption of the sinus is already removed: then irrigate it with that which makes flesh grow there.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, as you receive from the plaster dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose oil, and sticking wine: or clysterize it with certain medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise of ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the opening of the sinus is narrow, in which a clyster cannula cannot enter: then widen it with a small knife: or put a linen cloth smeared with Egyptian ointment or basil ointment into it, until it widens.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the opening is also wide, then gather its lips together with a suture: and release from it as much as can enter a clyster without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the opening from which the pus runs is elevated upwards: then dry it in a lower place which is within it, so that the pus may run out of it downwards: because when pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus about lower part of it as you wish; then try to prepare the member with a preparation which will drain pus from it easily as it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try so that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all; and take medicinal substances which are placed over the sign, suitable to what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them upon linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such quantity that it may communicate the whole of the Sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps at the direct opening of the sinus foramen, a little larger than the opening of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the ointment soft on another cloth, according to the quantity of the hole: and place it over it in a position far from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it may be relieved: and do not remove the large cloth unless after some days once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	He who is over the opening of the Sinus is he whom you remove at every hour so that what has gathered there from pus may go out. And so that you know whether that which runs out of it is much or little; or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this again consider the place of the Sinus, whether the lord feels pain in it or not, and whether there is an abscess in it or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your treatment is extended thus, and you see the matter which comes out above the opening of the Sinus, then know that the Sinus is already adhering, or approaching adherence: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If, however, a subtle virus emerges from the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adherence, because its healing is approaching, because there are some men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are some who act contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If after many days undigested pus exits from the sinus, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its matter is prolonged: then in the drying of the medicines, truly let physicians do that they be moist in their substance and dry in their virtue: such as unguent dyafinicon, when there is added to it superfluity of addition from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last cure which is made, it is that you receive diaconical ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and return over it ancient wine equal in substance to its own.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then make it with him, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now he does something similar to this action, when you do not have dyafinicon ointment at hand, honey, when you have boiled it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take frankincense, and aloes, and myrrh: pound the whole thing, and pulverize it over honey while it is over fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then a linen cloth over the same pad, and tighten it over the sinus: and a linen bandage with honey that you have boiled until it is thick, and dust it over the top, and place it on the pad, and tighten it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes it is administered with long birthwort and roots of heavenly lily, and lily: and the herb's flour, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use these simple or combined ones, rub them, and also the sieves themselves: and pulverize above honey which I have narrated, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the matter of the sinus prolongs itself and does not heal with this treatment: then know that there is corruption deep within it; or it already makes impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or on the ligaments: then cure it with the treatment of fistulas, according to what has been said before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On the treatment of a felon and an abrased nail, and the addition of a finger digit, and sectioning.
Caput XCI.	Chapter XCIX.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A panaritium is an abscess that is born under the nail of the finger of the hand, or of the foot: and perhaps it is born in the remaining fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore the matter is prolonged and its cure is neglected, and it becomes inflamed with a hot abscess; or it decays and emits pus until it corrodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it destroys it entirely, and perhaps the decay reaches the bone until it has a foul odor; and the extremity of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you treat the flesh, with that which we said in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you cut with a knife all the superfluity that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	A heated cautery is very useful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If the bone is sound and the nail is also healthy, and the additions of the empty nail already press the flesh to the insides, and they begin to prick it, and wound it: then it is necessary that you place a thin Radicum under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards: and cut into that flesh with ease, and place on top of that which remains of flesh from burning medicines, corrosives, until the whole thing is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If corruption has already set into the bone, then it is necessary to cut into that bone and remove it; for it is never cured while the corrupted bone remains in place.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see that decay and corruption are advancing in the finger, then cut it at one of the nodes, according to what has been said before about its recollection.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If it happens that a nail is rubbed or struck and there is severe pain in it, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the fingernail with a sharp spatula, making a transverse section from top to bottom as desired.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard that the cutting does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause to happen through it an intense pain on the weak one, and it will be a cause to the birth of flesh added in place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with that which allays pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger which is born in some hands of men, perhaps is fleshy throughout: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its nativity is in some nodes of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, he who is born in certain knots of the finger, does not move: and he who is born at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the section of that which is fleshy from those things is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, that you cut it at its root with a wide Spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	The cure of him whose nativity is at the root of the articulation is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from incisions of it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that one who is born in the finger at the last of the knots, then it is necessary that you cut first his flesh with a round incision unto the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw with one of those saws suitable to it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him until he is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The solidifying together of the fingers, which often happens either from birth, that is, it is born with it, or from the closing of a wound, or burning with fire, and the like.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary that you cut away that consolidation, until the fingers return according to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them strips of linen or cloths soaked in rose oil so that they do not coalesce too quickly, and separate them; or place between them a thin lead sheet until the place has consolidated according to what is necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if it happens that a consolidation occurs with some fingers and palm, then dry that consolidation according to how it is prepared and convenient for the figure of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	On the incision of a tumor.
Caput XCII.	Chapter XCII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	These are veins that are wrapped up, large and full of superfluous melancholic humors which occur in many parts of the body: and most frequently these happen in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and labor, and carry things.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore it is necessary that you administer an excision of the body from black bile sometimes with a strong excision.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then the surgeon should cut open a vein of the patient.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of them with iron is according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they are cut and black blood is extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And another way is, that the vein may be lifted up and taken out entirely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section is as follows.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First soak the leg in hot water a great deal until the thick, foul blood dissolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the leg of the infirm from the upper part of his hip, as far as the lower part of the knee with a band.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry out the vein in one place, or two, or three with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then elevate, that is, draw blood from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and the phlebotomist should first attend to those who are ill.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the nail with care until the amount of blood that you see is sufficient and which the strength of the weak person can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Thereafter bind it: and order him to abstain from foods that produce black bile; and repeat evacuation and phlebotomy, when the veins are full, and this harms the sick person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	Its elevation is according to this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	If the leg is sick and there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce it into the bath: or embrocate it on his leg with hot water, until it turns red and the veins swell: or exercise it vigorously if there is no bath present, until the limb heats up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin in a direct vein incision along its length: or at its end at the knee, or in the lower part of it at the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and scarify the vein from every part until it appears to the sense: and at its appearance, you see it red to blackness declining.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it comes out of the skin, you see it white as if it were a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce a probe under it until it is elevated and emerges from the skin; suspend it with a curved hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then make another incision nearby the first incision three finger-widths away.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then elevate it with rays as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then a dry incision, or several incisions, if you need it so.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then elevate and make an incision at its last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then extract it to the incision which is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you have removed it from the incision which is higher, or higher incisions, until when it comes out completely: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you to be extracted and lifted: then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it, and extract it: or insert a probe under it: and revolve your hand to every part, until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware that it not happen.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it will be difficult for you to remove it well, and it will enter over the weak one harm from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have extracted it whole, then place over the wound's location wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil: and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vine is contracted, having a twisting which wraps around its parts, and it is not as we said according to straightness; then it is necessary that you find on every part of its twisting and the locations of its wrapping.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you have lifted the whole thing up; and be careful at your incision upon it that you do not cut a vein or wound; for it will be difficult to lift or remove it from above you.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The form of incision for healing a wound.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of an inguinal hernia.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not to be cared for like the rest of the hooks, nor does it have a sharp tip, so that it may not wound a vein; and it is of thick flexibility, gentle: because if it were fine, it would wound a vein with its fineness; indeed let its excess thickness be as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the Extraction of the Vein of the Leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in warm lands, such as Al-Jazira and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands, with little moisture, that is, where no grass grows nor trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from putrefaction that happens under the skin, just as it happens inside the bodies of snakes and roundworms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein's condition is that there is a vehement inflammation in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then it is sewn up.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then begins the vein to exit from the place of that incision, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore the extremity appears, then it is necessary that you envelop upon the very same piece of lead, whose weight be from one drachm to two drachms and knot it: and let go the suspended lead from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever anything issues forth from it to the outside, envelop that in lead and tie a knot in it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged much, then cut a part of it, and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it root and branch before it has entirely come out.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it contracts and enters into the flesh, and causes a boil to occur, and rot in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary that it be gently treated and extracted gradually until it emerges from its last part, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein there exits in some men what is five palms long and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has come to me because a man came out of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If it happens to you during your treatment time: then insert a ray into the hole of it, and perforate it with a long hole, with the body, until all that is in it from matter is evacuated; and administer the putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for the healing of abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle joint, or in the foot itself: and it happens to have many openings, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore, treat the wound, as we have said in the division, and with that which has been previously stated.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	On cutting out worms generated under the skin, and it is called the ailment of cattle.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter XCIIII.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This ailment is called in our region "Bull's disease" because it happens often to oxen and there is a small worm which is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it moves throughout the entire body, ascending and descending: and it is shown to the sense during its walking from limb to limb, until it ruptures wherever it ruptures in the skin, and exits.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the rotting of some humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and serpents, that is, roundworms and pinworms, happen in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when he enters the body and is raised to the head and arrives at the place: then perhaps he opens in it and exits and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	Therefore, when you wish to treat him and remove him, then this is done only in his walking and appearance to his sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary that you bind what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligament constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry it over itself, and remove it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it goes deep into the flesh, and you do not find it, then put over the place a cautery with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And that which is feared more, is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If you see it having arrived at the head near the eye, then tighten under it the eyebrow with a good constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and remove it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick one use purification of his body, with medicines dissolving bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that produce decay.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the cutting of a wound for illness according to Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter XC.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This ailment is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs: then it changes from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I indeed have already seen him, according to what I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a woman who was ill with certain pains.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And he exposed his arm, and I saw a slight swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I had waited for an hour, I saw one swelling move with a worm-like motion, ascending toward its shoulder faster than is possible; like quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore pain receded from that place, and it was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then he sat for an hour, and it ran into the rest of his body until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that he was turning over his whole body, as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed at the speed of its transposition from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I truly before that had not seen this illness with my eyes in this way according to this manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	Nevertheless I have seen many who find pain to be shifted from limb to limb: and I have not seen it with my own eyes, as I saw it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that this is anything other than because the woman was from those who have been found with dry veins of the body; therefore, it appears to the sense this alteration by wind.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, the hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you wish to cure it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to you, as we have said, then tightly grasp above it, and below it quickly: and dry above it, until that windiness has been driven out; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it with an expulsion of the body, and with that which expels winds, and carminates them with foul pills, and pills of sparrow, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their kinds and according to the places in which they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is: because among them there are those that have large points, and small ones: and concave, and dull.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And of these are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And from those who have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And from those which have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those which are according to limbs in which they fall, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or else the parts are concave from the main parts, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and things similar to these.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into any of these limbs, and the signs of death appear to you, which I tell you after, then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then extract it, and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	When an arrow falls into the brain and penetrates it, and exits through the foramen above the cerebrum, these are the signs: because violent soda, scotoma, vertigo, redness in the eyes, inflation, redness of the tongue, spasms, and a mixing of the intellect, and vomiting of cholera occur from it.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood comes out of the nose, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And moisture white like a poultice comes out from the wound's place.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And it exits from there like a watery consistency of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not exit.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left breast: and he feels as if it is fixed in a hard thing, not in a hollow thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the motion of an arrow is similar to the motion of a pulse: and blood black runs out of the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And follows that coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting spells.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death certainly comes.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow wound to the lung is the outflow of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels which follow the neck become suppurated, and the color of the sick person changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And expires great spirit, high: and seeks attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If an arrow falls into the membrane that is in the chest: then it is near the ribs: and a great sigh is made with violent pain: and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something indigested will emerge from the wound along with food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the belly, and lodges there, something of feces will come out of the wound, or a piece of the intestine which is already torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope of healing it, nor of extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If a shaft falls into the bladder and urine flows out, and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger over the weak, then you shall know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and spatula, and aid, and dorsal vertebrae, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar parts of the limbs are cured according to various arrangements: when it does not find the artery or nerve; and there is no poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I saw of these arrows, that you may know by this about your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is because a certain man had an arrow fall into the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore I extracted it from the other part, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under his lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not extract from it except its small end, with which it adheres to its shaft; and it was a large arrow from the arrows of the Turkish bows, with a blunt iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healed, and no evil accident happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And there was an Arabic arrow, and it is that which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore I followed it upon its own between two guides: and now it was submerged in its throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	Therefore I worked on it until I extracted it: and Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man who had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut above the arrow.  I worked on it and extracted it. He was healed, and no harm befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man who had an arrow wound in his back, and the wound had closed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After that, seven years having passed, a arrow emerged from the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow fell into her belly, and the wound was consolidated upon her, and the arrow remained inside her; and nothing of her dispositions was changed, and the woman did not find harm to her in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man to whom an arrow had fallen in his face: and the wound was consolidated, and remained, not finding much pain in him: and similar things like these many.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already declined to the right side a little: and the arrow was entirely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	Therefore I was called to his care after a gunshot wound for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	Therefore, I found a wound caused by an arrow quite severe.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	Therefore I inquired about it with a fine probe, and I did not feel it: and he himself found a prick and pain under his ear on the right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	Therefore, I believed that the puncture was from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	Therefore, I applied a plaster to the place with a plaster that had attractive and digestive power, confident within myself that the place would suppurate and that there would appear to me the sign of an arrow so that I could cut above it: and it did not happen in the place an accident signifying that the arrow had followed the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	Therefore I treated him diligently with a poultice for many days: and no accident happened, and the wound was consolidated in the meantime: and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	Therefore I placed on that wound a medicine acute and corrosive for many days until it opened; and when I felt it, and sensed the subtle point of the arrow adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the incision of the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared visibly to us; and about four months passed for me with him.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to introduce forceps into it, and to move it, and it did not obey to exit: then I did not cease to be subtle and ingenious upon it with modes of ingenuity, until on one day I began upon it with forceps properly made, according to what will come in the form of them at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And physicians judge that cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the sickly man was healed in perfect health: nothing harmed him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of extracting certain arrows: so that you may place that rule and meaning over that which I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed with the narrative; nor does that book comprehend it, and a wise artificer compares with little to much; and with what is present to what is absent; and finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descents of foreign things of this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that arrows do not come out of members in which they are fixed, except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by drawing it out from the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or conversely, of the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which goes out where it entered, is either an arrow proceeding in fleshy place: and it is drawn and goes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not yield to removal by the hour in which it falls: then you ought to let it alone for several days, until the flesh that is around it has rotted, and the attraction of it has been lessened, and its exit made easier.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is situated in the bone and does not obey you for its exit, then let it be (released) even for several days; and repeat it with traction and motion every day until it emerges.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not obey you at the exit after days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the very bone from every part with a fine borer until the arrows are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already progressed into one ventricle of the brain, and appear from the sick some of those accidents which I have said: then abstain from the traction of the arrow, and let it go, until it may be equal to be its after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if an arrow comes to the shaft, then death does not prolong for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, only in the body of the bone, and does not penetrate to the fascia, and remains weak for several days, and nothing happens to him from those accidents, then ingenuity in the traction of the arrow and its extraction.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If, however, it is fixed firmly and does not obey you when you pull on it: then administer a terebellum around the arrow's shaft, as I have told you; then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If now the arrow is already hidden in the place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sense: then inquire for it with a probe.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments which are suitable for its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot remove it because of the wound's constriction and because of the arrow's length deep within; and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then leave it there until the wound is enlarged and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If the ears are those that are held fast, then free the flesh fixed in them from every part, with every means you can, and means, if it cannot be done by evacuation of the flesh in fractures of the ears and their torsion, until it is evacuated.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps to all parts, until you make it come out: and with the subtlest last subtlety, so that the arrow does not break, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot operate on it within one hour, then release it for several days until what is around it rots.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it: for if the wound is relieved. But if the blood flow does harm to you, then administer what we said about the cure in its chapter: and guard your virtue from incision of the vein, or nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer the skill in every way that is possible to you for the evacuation of the arrow, and let it be with ease, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you do when drawing a shaft, that the weak point be according to the figure, according to how it was in the case of the shaft itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more useful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If it is not possible for you to do that, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow that comes out from the opposite part or something already proceeds from it to the outside: or it makes a hump of the extremity of the arrow by sense from the upper part of the skin nearby, and you see it prominent: therefore dry it above, and let the section be according to the quantity which they grasp in it with forceps.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it out: for indeed it becomes easy to extract.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is held in bone, then turn your hand according to the roundness until the awl presses into the bone and enlarges itself; then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: let it be released for some days; then repeat it, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If a piece of wood from an arrow is in it, then drive it out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If a stick has fallen and you wish to administer a thrust: then insert into it a concave instrument so that the concavity of it enters the tail of the Arrow: then drive it with the same.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If however the arrow is concave, then drive it in with an instrument entering it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	The arrow is therefore lifted by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut out all the flesh in which the poison is; if it is possible for you to do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then care for it as is fitting.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow is falling in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is near because you touch it with your finger, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of incision of the vein, or nerve, and remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then sew the wound, if you see it, and care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of Forceps, with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the extremities be like the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp upon the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many kinds, great and small and medium, are made of these, according to the quantity of magnitude of the Arrow, and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its constricting.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	Shape of the Concave Implement.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the Impeller for deafness.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is for a deaf limb like the radius, so that its entrance may be relieved into a concave arrow, and it may be driven in with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extremity of this plunger is concave like a bird's feather; so that the entrance of the arrow into it and its impulse may be lessened.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	On Bloodletting of Veins.

Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it is opened with a broad lancet.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not right for a phlebotomy at an acute extremity to be like the rest of the phlebotomies, but rather let it be at a blunt extremity.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And let the lancet be passed across it; because the bone is near, and perhaps the lancet will break when it is fine.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	On Phlebotomy of Veins By Al-bu casis.

Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore cut both sides with a double incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If there is doubt about you, and you do not know which of them it is: then attend to the incision of the larger ones, and those more obvious.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	On the three veins in the arm.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins that are opened with a lancet on the arm are those in which the practice of cutting is customary in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And bloodletting is done on them in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or by pricking with a broad myrtle lancet: or olive tree to the fineness of the slope: or cutting with a knife-shaped lancet, and it is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Al-Zahrawi is, that which is suitable for the section.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And of these there are broad and subtle kinds, according to the width of the veins and their constriction. The form of a myrtle phlebotomy should be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is fitting to open veins that are concave, full, coming forward, appearing, thick, and those which contain coarse, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this lancet is of lesser width and more refined point.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is fitting for bloodletting of veins fine, which contain thin yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On bloodletting at Basilaca.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilica vein, which is one of these three veins for bloodletting, is helpful.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from illnesses that are in the throat and neck, because it follows the chest and belly: and it is fitting for the phlebotomist with the phlebotomy knife to be careful, and to be above fear from it, for under it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he errs, and adds in puncture of a vein, he incisions that artery, and there occurs the flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary that she be not bled with a sharp lancet: rather let it be cutting with an alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the basilica does not appear with a clear manifestation, then it is necessary that one seeks out another, and transfers it to another, or seeks out another branch of it; or cuts the brachial artery instead of phlebotomizing.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is manifest, and dry it with ananetil, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you wish to perform a bloodletting on him, then before the tightness of the arm, touch the place until you know the location of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place over the area with a hot iron, then the arm, and cut the vein dry with a curved incision using a  phlebotome Alnesil, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware lest the percussion fall through the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, an inflation in the place which you marked with the encaustic, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood rising at venipuncture, like a boy's urine, and it is fine, reddish blood, then know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Therefore hasten and place your finger upon it in a long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore the blood is cut (for it is often cut), then bind the arm and release it: and let the patient beware of the movement of it: and be above his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let it not be moved for several days until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If blood does not stop flowing, and it overcomes you, and there is no medicine present at your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities are contracted, and blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of  bark and grind it fine. Take half of it and bind it over the place where the vein is narrowed with a bandage and poultice until the next day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is cut, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then care for the one with him whose predecessor's recollection from the place of dust-cutting flow of blood: and the cutting off of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a ligament from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On Phlebotomy of the Vein called Fusca.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The veins of the Fuscae are a help in phlebotomy because they draw blood from the upper part of the head and lower part of the body; because it is composed of the Basilica branch and the Cephalic branch, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the bloodletter that he should be above fear from his phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds in the incision of venesection, and finds a nerve, there occurs in it numbness, and healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve appears many times to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If it is hidden in some people and is subtle and does not appear: then you must place your phlebotomy there, the incision with a sharp knife, and cut the nerves with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The vein of the head benefits from bloodletting because it draws blood from the head and brings relief to eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, that the phlebotomist prick it with a lancet olive-shaped, or with a myrtle-shaped lancet: because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery beneath it, nor nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	Nevertheless, it is fitting for you in phlebotomy to avoid cutting the head of the lizard with the lancet so much, and to seek a softer place: and it does not harm him if it is not found with the first percussion, that it be repeated upon it several times with the lancet.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Yet perhaps a boil may develop in some people when it is not lanced in the first percussion, but this boil does not harm them in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the utility of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy, and its accidents from it, about which you ought to think carefully.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First, therefore, you ought to know that bloodletting is not administered unless for the preservation of health and its perseverance, and caution against the approach of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And let a bloodletting be made in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely Cephalic, and Dark, and Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that venesection be done at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in summer, and autumn, and in winter after a meal, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let a bloodletting be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Bloodletting, which is administered in illnesses, does not have a determined hour; but when necessity and convenience call for it, at night or day, and at every hour, and at every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And boys should not be bled until they come to fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	A pregnant woman shall not be bled, unless from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	The elderly who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When therefore someone wants to have a bloodletting for any reason, it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels before the bloodletting with a gentle enema, if there is much retained feces in them: so that the veins during the bloodletting do not draw up putrid superfluities from the intestines which are harmful to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient who is vomiting from fullness be bled, nor one who is drunk or suffering from drunkenness until that has passed from him.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor one with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let phlebotomy be avoided again after colic passion, and vomiting, and flux of the belly, and multiplication of intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and all that dissolves virtue from the bodily or animal substance.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider in the subtlety of humors before that, if blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for him to do that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then he enters the bath, if nothing prevents him; or he is exercised with some exercise, so that the blood may be made more subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place the phlebotomy of him in his chest, about the third day, as we said: and endeavor that his chest be evacuated on that day from all accidents of evil animals: such as anxiety, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and punishment, and superfluity, and those similar.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him make present to his seat things of which use men have grown accustomed from fragrance and scent and excitement and similar things as much as possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the bloodletter should sit on a stool, which is higher than the patient's bed; afterwards he takes out his arm and rubs it with his hand twice, or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then tighten the bandage with corrections and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, for when a constriction is unequal, either through an excess in the constriction, then it prevents the course of blood; or in softening, then also it prevents the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after constriction, it is necessary that the surgeon rub his hands together with a cloth until the veins swell and are apparent to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist shall clean the lancet with a little oil, an old one in particular.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he places his index finger of the left hand upon the vein in the place where he wants to perform phlebotomy, carefully so that it does not slip away and the blow is not missed.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because of the veins there is which you find like a fleeing chord among the bloodletters: and from them is that which is full of windiness: and when you place the bloodletter upon it, it contracts under the bloodletter, and the bloodletter is deceived, and does not open the vein: and if he opens it, it is strict: therefore it is necessary that the bloodletter be firm, and be solicitous in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should put down the lancet.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore a vein is opened from one place, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if this does not happen, then repeat the same thing in another place nearby, or above it with haste: if the place does not suppurate.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If it is suppurating, or the patient grows weak, then dismiss him on one day, or two days: and let him not tighten a bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps it will draw a hot abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Let him not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let a bloodletting be done, if he desires.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the incision is small, or if blood runs subtly and you fear that not the quantity of blood which you wish will leave; then repeat the phlebotomy in the very hole according to straightness, and add a little in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this with speed, before the place becomes closed up, for an infected place is in many men at a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see the abscess itself, then you do not go over it at all, for it does not excuse anything to you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something of the oil of feces upon it; because it will lessen the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than oil itself, and than the rest of the olive.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the feces of oil in all your bloodletting, where you bleed veins at the stopping of the flow of blood; and they do this with tyriaca alfarach, and sagzena, when it is placed from one of them on the spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood is refined and dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If it happens that a large abscess occurs at the site of phlebotomy, for often this happens, especially to those who are not subjected to phlebotomy except when necessary, or whose vein opening is small, then immediately place a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated briefly, over the site; and bind it for one hour: because it will be resolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has exited from the vein itself, with its complement, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If something remains in the place after days, some blackness, or greenish color, it does not harm. And if you wish, place upon it something of aloe, or myrrh dissolved, or something from the juice of mint, that is, spearmint, or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And very often indeed abscesses and swellings occur at venesection in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Place therefore your hand upon it, then if you find softness at your compression upon it, then that eminence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, be careful that you place something upon it from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from it of an artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a poultice for him with that which has astringency so that the place may close.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as well as the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you remove from every man according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color prevailing over blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	If the blood is black, then let it exit until it becomes red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go out until it becomes fine; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And he who is full, strong, and needs a single bloodletting, let the vein be widened, and the incision should be wide. And in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of this.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he removes it with a probe and that the opening be narrow; and better yet which is administered in phlebotomy of the vein is, that there be a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this way of bloodletting is safe from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy, and healthier than bloodletting across width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to him who is accustomed to faint during bloodletting, it is necessary that he eat before bloodletting bread moistened with a little pomegranate juice, or heated cumin, if it is available; and draw from his blood in three or four veins.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a cold constitution, then let him take before the bloodletting bread soaked in syrup of honey, or in syrup of honey flavored with spices, or in aromatic and fragrant syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If fainting should occur during bloodletting and the cause is the exit of much blood, then it is necessary that he takes a drink of meat water and a subtle aromatic syrup. And let him use the aroma with algae, and anoint his chest with it. And let him use the rest which we said in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wants to bleed his arm and release his blood the second time: he who has a phlebotomy for the sake of great evacuation, and whose strength is weak, must let his blood out gradually by the amount of strength over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	He who wishes to open his arm and let out his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do this after seven hours, or nine from his first incision.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	He who wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part from which it inclines: it is necessary that he be bled on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In the body which has a great deal of blood now heated and sharpened, and causing fever to occur: it is necessary that the blood should exit from it in one vein, and a large quantity be extracted: and the opening should be widened until fainting occurs: after you have carefully observed all the conditions of phlebotomy: and so that you place your hand over his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death may not occur instead of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Often indeed it happens when the bloodletter does not know, and negligence falls.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you wish to loosen the arm and loosen the blood second, with the opening of the vein already closed, and let the blood flow out be difficult, that one should apply excessive force upon it, and it is quickly extended.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a great evil, indeed let it be put aside until it is lanced a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of a lancet what has clotted from blood at the opening of the vein, and put something salt dissolved in water on top of it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place upon it something of tyriaca alfaroch, or sagzenea, and place it with a gentle compression, until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If however a vein has already become part of an abscess, then release it, and do not hold it until the abscess sits.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If necessity compels to let blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either the phlebotomist should cut him above that place, or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the vein of the arm is cut at the place of Fucus and Basilica, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of bloodletting is that the sick person should insert his hand into hot water until the vein becomes red and appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it shall be bound over itself with a ligament with moderate constriction in the middle.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the incision of the vein according to transverse section gradually, not laterally, nor lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and let your incision of the vein be such that it cuts above the joint of the hand a little.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If he prevents the outflow of blood, then repeatedly put your hand in hot water and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If, however, you are on summer days, then you are excused from the repetition of hands in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed very much the course of blood is placed in warm water in time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And bloodletting of this vein is healthier than all veins, because under this vein there is no pulsating nor nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Phlebotomy of Saluatella's right hand is good for ailments of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that you should tie up the vein with a bandage or your hand after you have introduced it into warm water until the vein swells and is demonstrated to the sense very much.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then the phlebotomist cuts across it.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm it in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful, lest you cut with your hand as you use a lancet.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under it are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then apply your hand to warm water and let blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	If you do not repeat it in hot water, blood clots at the opening of the vein and is prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When therefore you shall have extracted from the blood the quantity of necessity, then put upon the vein oil and salt: that it may not solidify quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly it is necessary that you do with every branch tight.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The wound from the left-hand vein is: because it is connected to spleen sickness; and similarly do you act in its phlebotomy, just as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit of cutting the saphenous veins is for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as pains of the womb, and retention of menstruation, and infirmities of the kidneys, and ulcers of the hips and legs old, and similar kinds of ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that the sick person puts his foot into warm water and makes friction above it until the veins are full, and ties above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the vein is situated near the heel, appearing towards the thumb: and they branch out from it on the face of the foot many branches.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, let the phlebotomist make the incision in the larger branch of it, or near the heel in its collection, because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If he incisions her on the sole of the foot, then carefully avoid the nerves which are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your incision for phlebotomy as if you wish to cut it transversely, and let the lancet be Nisil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If the exit of blood is prevented, then bathe his foot repeatedly in warm water: and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the bloodletter errs in the first attempt, then return with phlebotomy to the upper parts for a short time, for the location is safe, and you do not fear evil from it, when you avoid the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the calcaneum from the left side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the treatment of this vein-cutting is for pain in the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of his phlebotomy is that he enters the bath and hastens: and he tightens his leg from the side of the buttock to above the heel four fingers' width, with a fine long bandage: for it does not appear otherwise because of this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When therefore it appears, then the phlebotomist it according to whatever ingenuity is to you possible, or according to the transverse section: and it is better, either that you cut it with incision, or you sever it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	The place indeed is safer, and it itself is hidden deep in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the sense: then the phlebotomist should take some branch of it, and it is the one that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear: and beware of the nerves, and make it run from the blood as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then solve the stricture and place leather over the site of the incision and tighten the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	It heals quickly indeed.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	On Blooding and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Instruments are made from horns, and from bronze, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And ventosaion is performed according to two modes.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With incision and bloodletting, and another is ventilation without incision.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this blowing which is without incision, is according to two modes.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And there are fourteen places in the body which are treated with cupping and scarification and bloodletting.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	One is Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and ventosae Alhagdahim, and they are two plates of the neck from two parts simultaneously: and ventosae menti, and it is under the jaw in the lower mouth: and ventosae of two spatulas: and ventosae Alachosos above the end of the tail: and ventosae of two focilium, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and ventosae of two legs: and ventosae of two tails.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed ventosaion does not draw blood from the small veins scattered in flesh, and therefore there is no loss of strength from them, as there is in the case of phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	It is not necessary to administer pessaries with or without fire in any illness that arises from repletion, until the whole body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity requires ventosaion from illness, or because of custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and at any time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is, because it happens to some men that when blood multiplies in them until the need arises for its removal by venesection, they find heaviness and pressure in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them is he who has found a swelling and redness on his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And of these is one who has found itching in his face and forehead, and darkness, and blurring in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And there is one who digs a place for his ventilation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And there is one whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And of these there is one who finds a taste of blood in his mouth: or his tongue becomes ulcerated and discharges blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And there is one whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And there are those who see in their sleep blood and redness, and slain and wounds, and things similar to these.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something of these things, and properly if it is in the third week of the month: we then prescribe that ventilation should be done, after two or three hours have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	A wound of the neck's windpipe is, because it brings together to the heaviness in the head, and that which pours out to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	And it is necessary that this be after evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this indeed is a suction cup in the place of cephalic venesection.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted to use it by one who has a cold constitution, or who has a cold.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it inflicts great harm upon him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of this, it is not necessary that they should use these things, the elderly, and those whose head are afflicted with cold pains.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Whoever is diligent about it, oblivion is generated upon him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for this reason it is necessary that you instruct the Ventilator to lay his hand with a somewhat windy lower, fearing from the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Bloodletting or Alkehel is done in the place of Fuscae phlebotomy and Basilicae phlebotomy, and for this reason it relieves asthma, and constriction of breath, and instruments fissure of breath, and cough, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the Alkehel be driven by a suction cup for a short time, because if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Bloodletting, however, of the alhagdahim relieves headaches caused by accidents, and ophthalmia, and migraine, and perforations, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in place of phlebotomy at the Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Aspirator so that he does not press his hand when making a cut, lest he hit an artery and there be a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The suctioning under the chin, helps with alcohol in the mouth, and for gum disease, and similar ailments that are in the mouth; and it takes place in the place of phlebotomy elsewhere, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The inflation of spatulas is helpful for cauterization, which is done by reflection and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The suction of the interior parts with two foci helps the phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilicae, and Fuscae, and Cephalicae: because it draws blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh; and these small veins draw from other thicker veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Ventosa to not proceed too far in the scarification; for the place is laid bare of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The suction cup, when applied over boils, helps with hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Ventor (Suction Pump) to be large and made of metal; because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps finer Suction Pumps break. And let it be scraped with a deep incision.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Leeches on the legs reduce by manifest decrease because they draw blood from the whole body, and contribute to old pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder: they cause menstruation, and contribute to both pain and shortness of breath: and they stand in the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins and of the groin.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	Nevertheless, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope to happen in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the healing of the windpipes is close to the healing of the two leg winds.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the placement of the vents is that you place the vent first empty, and draw (with) a moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the vents, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that humors come to the place with equal arrival: and do not cease to repeat this and continue, until you see the place already red and swollen, and the redness of blood appears: then therefore scarify, and repeat suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the arrangement of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is of men tender flesh, rare pores, it is necessary that he scarify him once, no more: that the place be not ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And tell the Ventusator to enlarge the incision and make it only slightly deep: and temper the suction in ease, and speed, and his own movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is a thickening in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first incision indeed there is opened a way to subtle bloodletting and its moistening; and in the second indeed, examination of delicate extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is foul indeed, then let a third scraping be made, so that it may reach its end.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And lastly, when we wish to draw blood gradually, or a little, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish to make an extraction of blood, we shall scarify many times with a multiple scarification.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep incision; and the equal limit in the incision is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What thing ought to be administered from oils at the positioning of Winds, and what should a Wind-stopper beware of.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that case, whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are narrow, it is necessary to anoint the places with Ventosare with open, soothing, resolving oils: if it is in summer time, such as alkeiri oil, or violet oil, or almond oil, or gourd seed oil.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in wintertime, then oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or syrup: and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If, however, the surplus is coarse and cold, then the oil should be bitter almond, or balm oil, or white oil, or anise oil: and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If a large incision is to be made in the tender flesh, it must be prohibited from oil, and this place must be washed after the operation with rose water, or cold water, or solar water, or water of cucumber, or water of purslane, and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is of much moisture, wash wounds with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumach, and the like.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	If these superfluities are coarse, he should wash his windy parts with old wine, or with wormwood water, or an infusion of anise or chamomile: and the like.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that ventilation be avoided in the bath, or in the vestige of the bath, indeed it is necessary that it be administered after exiting the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary for someone to sleep after venesection.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is that which ought to be regulated before venesection, namely phlebotomy?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after this it is necessary to consider first: then if he be suffering from a wind or phlebotomy and is choleric, and his blood is overwhelmed by sharpness and inflammation; then it is necessary for him to receive cooling things, such as pomegranate juice; and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and secanabin, and iuleb; and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And place his food chicks and meats of sheep, and foods cooked with herbs: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if its complexion is cold, it is necessary that it take in drink syrup of honey, or of althea, or asclepion made from seeds: and it should take medium fragrant wine, which is between old and new: and it should be prescribed that it use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put food for him of chicks, and canebir: and sparrows, that is, small birds: and collared dove chicks as well.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of venesection and phlebotomy be more than food; and it is necessary that in some men in the hours before venesection,  tyriaca alfaroch or medicine of musk, that is to say muscata, or alesselithe be given before venesection: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the main limbs are strengthened and the blood is refined.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not right that they should take it in a heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On varices without incisions.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Those incisions which are without incision are called evacuations which are placed over the liver, and spleen, and foot, and over the abdomen, navel, and places of the kidneys, and hip joint; because these members do not allow incisions upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought through these, except for either attachment from a member of blood to a member: such as we place the Ventose upon the nipples in the affliction of nasal blood flow.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to loosen coldness of wind unseen in a member: as when we place a poultice over the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it indeed thins out the limb, and heats it, and removes pain because it dissolves that windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed over the kidneys when there is a swelling or stone in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For with the force of its pull it perhaps opens up a wound, or removes a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly he does when it is placed over the liver, and the spleen in case of inflammation in both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these ventouses are administered with incisions only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they administer tepid water filled in affections of the pleurae: and that is so that it may be filled with a ventouse, and be large, hot water only, or water in which herbs which are suitable have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of a pessary administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two finger-breadths, according to what we have formed: and let its quantity in depth be half a palm: and let there be on its side, in the place which is about the middle of it, a small hole, according to the quantity which would enter it with a needle: let it be made simultaneously of copper or brass, of gross margin, soft, equal, and smooth: so that it does not injure the limb when it is placed upon it: and let there be in its middle a transverse rod of copper or iron, where a candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this is made wind-filled large, larger than we have narrated, and somewhat less than that, according to the ailments and age of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For boys and thin people there are other kinds of ventosaes than those for men and those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this wind-blown one with fire on the limb is, that you light a torch with fire from linen properly, or a small candle from wax: and place it above the middle of the transverse bar which is in the middle of the wind-blown: so that the fire be kindled about the lower part of the wind-blown, so that the body of the sick person does not burn.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then a finger is to be placed over the limb, and the finger should be over the opening that I have said, until when we hold the windpipe: while we need it, remove the finger, and vapor will emerge over that opening, and the windpipe will immediately loosen.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then apply the fire lick according to its measure, and repeat it if needed.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the Ventous however which is administered in the pain of pleuritis with water, there is no transverse rod, nor hole: and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and placed upon the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this suction cup, the larger it is, so that it may take much water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	On the suspension of bloodletting.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter Ninety-Nine.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Leeches are not administered in many cases, except in those members where the position of venesections is not possible, because of their small size, such as the lip, and gums, and similar ones.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a denuded limb, such as a finger, and nose, and things like them.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that they be obtained from leeches which are in sweet waters, pure from corruption.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then let them be placed day and night in fresh water until they are famished, and nothing remains in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body shall be evacuated first with phlebotomy and with cupping.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wipe the limb of the infirm until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards they are to be placed upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are therefore filled and fall and there is possible suction of the place with a windpipe, then it is more ultimate in healing: and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water it is rubbed and squeezed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood continues after the application of leeches, and it is still oozing, then place a linen cloth soaked in cold water on top, until the bleeding stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then pulverize upon it  zegi or ground gall, and similar things from styptics, until the bleeding is stopped.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or let half beans, their outer skin removed, be placed over the place: and they be left until the beans adhere to the place, for the blood is cut off.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if repetition of bloodletting is necessary, when possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If leeches are forbidden from suspension, then the place shall be wiped with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Either fix a point (of) an awl in places until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are to be placed, for when they themselves feel something from the blood, they immediately adhere.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish them to fall, pulverize upon them something of crushed aloe, or salt, or ashes: and they will fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis Part III
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A universal discourse on restoration, and dislocation, and cure of torsion, and the like.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This Chapter is also many times necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O Sons, that those who boast about this Chapter are the foolish doctors and the common people, and those who have never looked at the book of ancients or read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this cause, this mode is deprived of sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never found anything good in it whatsoever, and I have not attained from it that which I have attained except because of the length of reading ancient books, and study above understanding them, until I extracted knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then by experience and study throughout my life's length.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you in this Chapter all that contains my knowledge: and above what has passed experiment, after I have abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation, and showed it at the end of declination: and I have formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, as it is by addition of declination, just as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries, and collections from there being fractures of bones, from those whose premiss is necessary before we begin the remembrance of broken limbs, and various ones, each one by itself.
Caput II.	Head II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, as we say at the beginning of this Chapter, that the greatest discourse and chapters, to the understanding of which the artisan first must be brought to the station over their truth: namely, that you, and those who are ready, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say therefore, that when it happens to anyone a fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or fall: then it is necessary, that you hurry first to bleed him, and release him, or both together; if nothing prevents it, such as weakness of strength: or he is one who has happened something of those children, or an old man decrepit: or the time is vehement heat, or vehement cold indeed.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, with cold herbs and the flesh of birds and hares: and forbid wine, and coarse meats, and filling oneself from foods and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are secure from the hot abscess, and do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb: then let the sick person return to his first regimen with which he used to custom.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When therefore a broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary for the sick person to be fed with nourishing foods, much, thick, heavy, containing viscosity: such as food made from boiled wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of oxen, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and things similar to these.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this treatment clotting of a fracture occurs more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that fractured bones, when they are in old men who are in the first old age, and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be continued and consolidated according to their own nature always, because of the drying out of their limbs; and those that are consolidated and continued from them are at the end of their softness, like the bones of young children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Nevertheless nature attaches something like glue to a broken bone from every side, which has thickness, so that it adheres and binds it until they are joined together, and bound together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was in the first place, until nothing prevents it from its operations: and because of this cause it is necessary that you put food for the sick with heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the kinds of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs; for a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the bone of the head: and a fracture of the bone of the chest is different from a fracture of the bone of the back: and similarly all the other limbs exist diversely one from another: and I have come with remembrance of every kind of fracture laid out in its own chapter distinct from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And there are various kinds of bone fractures even within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because it is fractured with an arc, besides which stars occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes a fracture of it is made according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures of it stars, that is, splinters, and additions proceeding, as they are in a reed, when it is fitted with a knife to write.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And if it does not proceed: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head: and there is a small fissure fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every kind has its own natural talent, or proper instrument in the restoration of it, according to what comes to mind, distinguished in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that which is known to be a fracture of bone, is its crookedness, and its prominence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no apparent twisting in place, nor a sound at your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, nor does the patient find great pain: then there is no fracture there, indeed it is possible that there is a twisting, or a small fissure: therefore it is not necessary that you move it with your hand and compression at all, rather put on top of it medicines of which remembrance comes, after the time that is convenient in place: then the constriction is tightened finely.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when the place is bent and split into two, and besides this abscesses occur in it, nevertheless, all parts are removed from their counterparts: then you must begin at your hour for its rectification, by leveling it before a hot abscess occurs to it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If a hot abscess occurs, then let it alone for several days, until the abscess is quiet.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equal it with whatever means it can by gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and its equalization is easier than bones, in which wounds occur often.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to how you will remember it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are splinters in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this limb fractured from two parts, if it is a hand or foot: or with your hand, if the limb is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb upon a level place, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the broken limb are extended; then endeavor, that you may return those additions with all skill, and according to whatever way you can in their places. And beware, according to your strength, lest there happens super infirmum through your operation pain, nor injury: and endeavor, according to your strength, that you apply one of the two bones with its companion, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour, that you test and touch him with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different, rectify it, and equalize it by the quantity of your virtue.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of vehement extension and strong compression, as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many times they cause a hot abscess to happen by that operation of theirs, or a contraction in the limb: as we have already seen from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind after setting, and a proper operation, and constriction of that limb, and rest, and tranquility: and warn the sick person about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him guard himself so that he does not move himself at the hour of his vigils, and in his sleep, and at his revolution, and agitation, and at his excretion, and all his movements with his last virtue.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that it may prevent (the member) from being placed in a position that follows with pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels pain or injury in the arrangement of a limb's position, then it is necessary to change it to another arrangement from that with which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with it, that its position be equal and straight, so that there does not happen crookedness in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the constriction of the broken limb is, according to what I relate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that broken limbs are diversified in their smallness, and their magnitude, and their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, those which are small, such as the arm, and finger, and foot, and similar to these, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft cloth, fine.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those which are gross among them, such as the hip and leg, ought to have a wide, tough bandage applied to them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad ligament connects the large limb and binds it on every part with an equal constriction so that it does not enter upon it a stain.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then after your evacuation, begin to apply a suitable liniment to the equation, on soft wool over the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage over the place of the fracture itself with three or four wrappings, according to what the limb deserves: and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with him to the upper part from the place of the fracture, and tighten less than was your constriction, which you constricted the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with the winding from the place of the fracture a little, and soften the stricture gradually, until you grasp a large thing from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another strip, and again wrap it over the broken place with bandages.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Thereafter go with the wrapping towards the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be on stricture of involution, and its softening, according to what we said in the first superior involution.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the bandages lint or cloth, with which the curvature of the fracture may be matched, if it has curvature; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wind a bandage over the wound itself.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards, equal superpositions of these involuted stars are made centrally, immediately, if there is no inflation in the place, nor a hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is inflammation or an abscess in it, then place over it what sits upon that abscess and remove the inflammation, and leave it for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind above it the very stars.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the Astrellae be from the middles of broad canes, scraped and wisely shaped; or let them be from wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi: and let the breadth of every Astrella be according to this form, and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	Nonetheless, the asterisk placed over the very area should be thicker and a little wider than the rest of the asterisks: and the length of the asterisk should be according to what is permissible for the limb in terms of size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tighten over the Astellas with another witta, according to the first tightening.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind above with threads properly, according to what we said about constriction: and let it be, that your constriction be above the place of the fracture more: and the less the constriction, the farther it is from the fracture.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that threads be of medium thickness and fineness, and that they be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Because if the threads are thick, as I saw from the operation of foolish surgeons who put their threads from twisted hempen cords, it is a great error because the constriction falls with them outside of quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And very fine threads are not suitable again; because you do not attain through the stricture with them what you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not right that there be less than a finger's width between star and star.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If a sick person is injured by the extremities of the stars after constriction in healthy places: then put under them soft cotton or carmine wool until nothing is hurt from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When, however, there is a fracture with a wound, and rupture occurs in the skin, I shall come to it with remembrance of it in the second chapter according to singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken limb ought to be bound with splints from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because when a limb is large, it is not necessary to place stars on top of it, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the event of a hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the way of plasters which ancients used to restore, which are placed upon a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The Method of a Common Plaster, Shortened for Restoring a Fracture, Suitable for Many Complexions, Especially Women and Children; because it is from that which does not conquer heat, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, as you take from the flour of the mill, and there is marrow of flour which hangs on the walls of the mill near the movement of the millstone: and you make it like this, except that sieves it with the membrane of an egg white: and put its preparation not thick, nor subtle.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	One method of poultice for restoring a fracture, dislocation, and torsion.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take  of mass, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugath; and juice of all, each ʒ X, myrrh, and aloe both, each ʒ V and alethil ʒ XX. Grind all together, sift them, and mix with alethil water; or with egg white, if the patient's condition is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and helps many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another mode of plaster which also helps with fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take powdered mugwort, and meal, and white clay, each in quantity of X grains; myrrh, and aloes both in quantity of V grains; acacia VI grains; Armenian bolis XX grains; grind all together with much trituration, and sift them, and make into a paste with water, or egg white: and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method for plasters on joints and bones separated from their places, and it soothes pain that happens to them, and a crack in the bone, and a fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take wool fleece and immerse it in vinegar and boiled oil, and place it over the area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no virtue of restoration, but it is good in the calming of a hot abscess; and it expels pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The Method of a Plaster for Restoring a Broken Bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of fig tree and leaves of wild poppy; and pound all, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The method of abbreviated plaster application, administered at the restoration of a broken bone; and when you desire the resolution of the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of althea, and chamomile, and violets' flowers, and herb flour, all one part each: grind everything together, and mix it with wine, if the limb is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is heated, then apply it with moistened coriander water, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	A stronger mode of plaster for resolution, than this first one, is used when a hard abscess occurs at the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take root of althea, and flaxseed, and balaustiae, and melilot, and tansy, and violet flowers, and chamomile, each one part, grind them all together, and make them with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	The whole thing according to the heat of the limb, and the quietness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	However Hippocrates did not say in his book that upon the restoration of a broken limb, anything should be placed upon it except for a plaster made from linen and oil: nothing else; and he narrated that it should be a medium between thickness and thinness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen thought it was necessary to place on the broken limb during its restoration things that have dryness of heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and frankincense, and similar things to those which we have narrated.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	A method of a poultice which is applied to injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugwort, chickpeas, and human hair cut or feathers of a bird,  and plantain, and salt in equal parts; grind them and sift them, and make a plaster from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity however according to what is proper, when the bandage should remain, then be dissolved, is, that you consider then, if it does not happen to the sick person pain, nor itching, nor is the broken bone moved from its place: then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it happens to him in the place itching vehement, or unrest pain, or inflation: then hasten, and solve in an hour him, and remove the plaster from him: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, humid: and submerge it in tepid water, and wash with it the place, until itching calms down, and sits the pain.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place over it a cloth soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind over it at night one, until you are secure from the hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb rests, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then bring him back again to the slight stricture, and a small plaster; and do not tighten him with your first constriction, and more subtle with him, until he heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, and swelling, and all accidents have been completely removed, and it is no longer painful from plaster or constriction, then treat it again as you did at first, equally well.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing of those things which we have said happens to a limb, then do not unwrap it, unless after three, or four, or five, or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is released after twenty days, the whole thing, according to what appears to you from the solution of the limb, as we said, until when the fracture adheres and coagulation of flesh approximates upon it: add also then in stricture more than your first stricture altogether: and add also in the increase of the sick person's food, according to what preceded recollection of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see that the place of a fracture has already dried up and widened more than is necessary, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore, embroider it with warm water at every turn where you have dissolved it, and let it be in all three days, and alleviate the stricture a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Therefore, by this operation nourishment runs to the limb and it is healed quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	That which foolish restorers do from a broken limb with another vice, when it is not restored at first, according to what is right, and restored according to crookedness, is an error from their operation, and great fear: and if it were straight, they would have said this in their books, ancients, and operated upon it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see anywhere among them a trace of it, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	On the making of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are diverse kinds of fractures, and its figures are many; and its causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a fracture is made which happens by a blow with a sword: and the blow takes away the bone entirely as far as it reaches to the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an ax does in wood: and for this reason this kind of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or if a sword strikes something of the bone and strikes its face, and the incision does not penetrate to its very end: this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, absolute loosening.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound of two fractures, either great or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from a fracture is, which is crushing, or attrition: and its cause is percussion with a stone, or a fall onto a stone, or things similar to these.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which already approaches the flesh under the bone; or it is on the face of the bone; and is a wound of these two fractures even small, or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from a fracture is this one, which is hidden in the bone in the fineness of hair: and it is a small crack, and because of this this kind of fracture is named capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these is a fracture, which is made by chance, or by the striking of a stone, and things similar to it, which cause the layer of bone to go into the inside, and concavity is made: as happens to kettles of air, when a blow occurs to them, and part of them goes into the inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And most of all this happens in the heads of damp bones, such as are the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And with all these types of fractures, splints are made separate, and I come with a recollection of the whole thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these kinds of fractures by detection upon it, and inquiry into them with probes, and removal of corrupted flesh which is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The type called capillary is recognized by this, that it is discovered over the bone, and removed, and smoothed over it with encaustum; for indeed a fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's condition: then if you see from the conditions that signify clearly dangerous symptoms, such as vomiting of bile, and stretching, and loss of intellect, and cutting off of voice, and fainting, and acute fever, and discharge from the eyes, and redness of them, and similar to these in many dispositions, undoubtedly he is not healed: and if you see non-earthly conditions, and hope for salvation: then begin his treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if a wounded person comes to you first when he is wounded, and it happens on cold days, then you must strive for the removal of the bone before the fifteenth day according to all arrangements.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary that you hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from the flap spoils and those accidents happen which we narrated.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If a fracture of the bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and it is with small pieces, and attraction: then it is necessary, that you cut the broken part, and rubbed, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, as you cut the head of the wounded: and cover over the bone according to any manner possible to you; and according to the figure of the wound, and what is light upon the weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it happens to you in the detection of a bone that there is bleeding, or a hot abscess; then oppose it with what is fitting.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine, and rose oil: and make the wound rest until the abscess sits, and be secure from blood flow.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the cure of bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to one of two modes.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One way is to cut the jaw with a sharp, straight knife: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another incision after the incisions, a little wider than the previous ones: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then administer also another incision wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you have a number of different incisions, some wider than others, and some shorter than others: and let them be at the end of their sharpness, and let them be made of iron or lead: and use ease in striking upon the incision so that it does not strike the head and harm it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary that you perforate around its edge, before you administer the cutting instrument, with boring instruments which are called Trebelles which do not go deep: and they are not named thus, unless because they themselves do not pass through the boundary of the bone to that which is behind it; for Terebellum has a rounded end above that which is below its sharp head, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents submerging and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it behooves you to take from these terebrums a great number, each one corresponding to the quantity of thickness of the bone, until you have for the present skull all terebrums: whose acute extremities' quantity in length and shortness shall be according to the quantity of thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of Borers, or Trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of piercing around the broken bone is: that you place the borer over the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the terebinth to another place, and put it where it is between every hole the quantity of thickness of a radius, or about that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the Incisors which is between every foramen out of bone: and make it more delicately than you can over it from the end of levity, as we have said, until you eradicate the bone, or with your hand, or with some other of certain instruments which you have prepared for it: such as tenaculae, and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you carefully avoid letting the terebrum or scalpel touch anything from the sheepskin.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you surround the bone by perforating it, and having separated it from the soft tissue if it has been continuous with it, and having extracted it, it is necessary that you smooth, and make equal the extremity of it which remains in the bone with another similar instrument incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	Nevertheless, it ought to be thin and subtle more than other scalpels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If anything remains of the small bones, and bandages: then take those with ease, with what you have among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after that with ointments and what we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another mode of operation is easy, far from fear: which Galen said, and praised him with great praise: and this is his word.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first of all, to begin to uncover the part of the bone from the place in which the fracture is more violent and more evident: until when you have uncovered that part, and placed under it the extremity of this lenticular Incisor, whose this is the form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part, it does not strike anything gently: and the pointed part of it, cutting into two sides of itself lengthwise, as you see: so that the lens-shaped part rests against the sphenoid bone, its sharp face incident upon the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike upon the incision with one side of a small hammer until you cut through the entire bone with ease, as it turns; and be secure from the cloth that no mishap will occur in it which you should fear at all.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon were not more foolish than men, and less ignorant of this, and were not asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the flesh in some places, he would cut it off from there with the pointed end of a lenticular knife, and free it from there with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It can be removed from him without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the bone fracture does not penetrate to the subcutaneous tissue, and what is cut off from the bone is its surface, and there remain in it roughness and subtle chips: then it is necessary that you scrape that roughness, and eradicate those chips with fine razors of which you have prepared a number of different sizes, so that it will be possible for you to administer them in every suitable place, and make them straighter, according to what the operation leads you to, and the broken bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer in your cutting, where in first rays of bone, wider those of razors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use a finer one after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing this according to continuity, until you come to administering finer and more subtle of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In every small fissure or capillary fracture, one must administer care according to that which leads to its straightening.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And there is a thing that is not hidden from everyone who studies this art, and it stands upon what we have written and shown in major fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If however the subcutaneous tissue is exposed and remains when you eradicate the bone, then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the quantity of the wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another doubled or tripled cloth and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do this as easily as you can so that it does not chafe it.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer above this wide ligament: and do not tighten it unless by the quantity which holds the wound only: and release it with this care on one day, or two days, until you are certain about the absence of a hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it and administer after that medicines with which there is superfluous dryness; such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and asarabacca, and things similar to these: and let it be, so that you make a powder out of these medicines, which is powdered over the wound like those that are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer in it all medicine of its property that it may cleanse and not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And care according to your skill, so that the wound in your treatment may be clean; and let there not be in it filth of ointment, nor uncleanness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Do not allow the virus to gather in it at all; for when the virus gathers above the brain's padding, it spoils and putsrefies it, and a great evil happens to the sick after that. And this happens in the head's siphac, when it is cleansed from it os, especially when care of it is neglected, blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider, if misfortunes of the kind we have said happen to the sick person, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur, unless from the medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine, to make that blackness: then it is necessary, that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and linen cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it on a sieve: afterwards care for it with appropriate kinds of treatment until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the parts of the nose are not broken except the two upper ones together, or one of them; because the lower part is cartilaginous and does not break, and it happens to it only attrition, and twisting, and things like these.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is broken, then it is necessary that you introduce a small finger into the nostril opening and equalize that fracture with your index finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape; and let this be done skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware lest through your operation that pain befalls the weak.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, then it is necessary to level it with the end of the radius, where there is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If a fracture is in two parts, then make a likeness of it; and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day at rest of the hot abscess.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then introduce into the extremity of the Nose a liniment made from linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part: or introduce two ligatures if the fracture is in two parts: and let the ligature be of such thickness as to fill the nostril opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that they should be infused with linen in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	It does not appear to me, indeed it ought not, that licinium should be poured into the albuginea, after being mixed with mill powder.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then dismiss the splint until the bone is firm and the cartilage hardens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nostril in place of a splint, after it has been wrapped with a soft cloth: and it is done so that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and so that the sick person is not prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this thing is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do this; and if you wish, do that other thing.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If it happens that the nose again becomes hot during the operation of a boil, apply a plaster to the nose with cauterium, or with cotton wool soaked in rose oil, or a small amount of dyacylon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to cover it with a plaster made of sesame meal and the powder of frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft wad on top of it, and do not apply anything at all to the nose.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are broken in a small fracture or splintered, then it is necessary to cut over them and remove them with instruments which are suitable for this purpose.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then suture the incision, and treat it with what is becoming, that it may become flesh and consolidate from suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound occurs between the nose, then it is necessary to cure it with linens: and administer a lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and the fracture is not with a wound, then look if it is only a break on the outside, and does not break in two, and is curved inwards: then its knowledge is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if there is a fracture in the right part, you must insert your left index finger into the bone of the injured: similarly, if the fracture is in the left jawbone, then introduce the index of your right hand: and drive with it the prominence of the fracture inward with ease to the outside with your other hand from the inner part of the bone centrally, and with it equalize it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jawbone has already been separated into two parts, then it is necessary for you to administer extension from both parts, according to the straightness; until it is possible to equalize it.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If a tooth has been shaken or broken, then bind those of which you hope will remain with a thread of gold, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a splint over the broken jawbone.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place upon that doubled cloth, and place above the cloth a large splint made centrally: or a piece of sole leather equal in length to the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it above, according to how the bandage is prepared for you, and it is fitting that its application should be made until it is destroyed: and order the sick person, that he may have peace and quiet: and put food of his intake soft.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you estimate that something is changing in form in some way: then hasten, and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been altered from it, and apply a plaster to it from ground powder, with albuginea or with sesame flour, after you have removed the caper. And place wool on top of the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While therefore that plaster remains attached to it, and the arrangement of the bone does not change, let him release it, so that he may not loosen it, until it is healed: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often set in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If meanwhile a hot abscess occurs, then administer that which we have said many times for its suppression, until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	Now the fragment is separated from the bone, or from the saw: then be more careful in this, so that you may remove those fragments of the saw with that which is convenient to you in their removal from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If however the opening of the wound is narrow, then widen it with a surgical knife according to the quantity of necessity.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed all the scabs and there is nothing left of them, then close the wound opening if it is wide; and if not, place over it from cloths which are suitable for it, and cover it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the collarbone when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The collarbone is broken most frequently from the front part from the side of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs according to one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or else it is broken and separated into two, besides which things may happen in it; and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or so it happens in bone fractures; and it is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or so, which is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation on it when there is a fracture without a wound is, that you have two assistants present, so that one of them holds the instrument that follows the fractured fragment, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture with your fingers until it forms its proper shape, so that there is neither prominence nor concavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If the indiges extends more, then it is necessary that you place under the patient's sphere a piece of cloth, or wool: and let its size be according to the quantity of your necessity: and extend, and elevate the furculum, and constrict the sphere with your hand, until the fracture is equal, as is necessary.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you are unable to draw the extremity of the clavicle outwards because it has reached deep inside, then it is necessary for the patient to lie on their neck and place a pillow medium in size under their shoulder. Have an assistant press the patient's shoulder downwards until the clavicle that is in the depths is raised upwards. Then straighten the fracture and align it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a splinter from the clavicle, and it moves: then it is necessary that you find it above it, and extract that splinter with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is held in the bone, then devise an incision into it with one of the Incisors that you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the Furcula the instrument which saves sifach; and it is an instrument out of wood, or out of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is similar to a drinking horn that has no concave shape.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to that which you require it from the magnitude of the bone, and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	The length of it also according to what is possible for you to the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two extremities, as you see; and one extremity be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the wound that you opened when you extracted the bone fragment is wide and you fear an abscess from heat, then bring together the two edges of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the rupture is small, or a hot abscess threatens: then fill the wound with pads and lint according to the size of the wound's cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a hot abscess occurs, then pour linen dipped in rose oil, vinegar, and wine onto it and place it on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	A stricture of bone when it is without a wound and without a section, is, as you put upon the bone a plaster made from mill flour with the white of egg.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft plug upon it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its [titillicum], if it does not fit.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a hemamat, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which should be long quite a bit; and let its width be that of one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a small doubled pad over the cotton and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a star from a fine board, whose width is three fingers, and in length likewise.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with a star in the place of the splints which falls over the fracture and place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place a splint on the fracture as it revolves, and wrap it over its neck, and under its healthy collarbone, and under its injured collarbone: and reduce it over all parts, and how you see that constriction holds the fracture, constricting properly: and this is what is not hidden from you, and the whole, so that it is not removed star from above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason it is necessary that you look at the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever therefore the ligament is softened, and you see the starlet already being removed: then straighten it, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sleep of the patient upon his back, and place under his pillow near his sleep a small cushion at night, so that when he is lifted it may aid him from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore, a fracture of the clavicle is raised by elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Either bind the arm to the neck of the person: and do not loosen the bandage unless an accident happens in the place from itching, or from a boil, up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the dressing, if you see its face suitable for it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add in the stricture, and release it, until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And a fracture of the clavicle is bound and supported for as many days as twenty-eight; and sometimes it happens in some men in less time than that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the restoration of a spatula fracture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	A spatula breaks rarely, and in a wide place of it: and the margins of it only break from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore that place is broken from it, and broken in the middle of it, and it is not known except by touch: then according to what the fracture's figure is, attempt its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it back to its natural form in every way possible to you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place over the place powder of mill with albumen of egg, and a soft plug, and place on top a small piece of doubled cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place upon it a broad board from a table according to the quantity of the whole spatula, or slightly larger than it.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If, however, there is a hollow in some places of the spatula under the star, then level that hollow with soft cotton wool until the star descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind it above with a long linen cloth, using a tight but not excessive constriction, and firming the splint until it is no longer movable from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever therefore the ligament is softened, tighten it, and equal the bone if it is moved from its place; and let the sick person lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And a spatula indeed is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is complete, then loose the ligament: and you be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose union is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If it proceeds from bone in a fragment and punctures under the skin: then cut over it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we have said for a fracture of the clavicle from the heat of an abscess, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	On the restoration of a broken breastbone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The extremities of this are indeed broken and splintered very much by accidents to it.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When the middle of it is broken, which inclines to the lower parts, and there happens to it a severe pain, and difficulty in breathing and coughing: and perhaps he vomits blood, and the concavity in the broken bone is declared, and is not concealed from the sense, Restoration of it is, that he who is ill lies on his back: and put between the spatulas of his ribs.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulder bones and bring the ribs together from two parts or sides with your hands: and with subtlety in its alignment, according to every way that it is possible and fitting, until it returns to the shape of the bone, as it ought.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place upon it a dressing and a plug, and place above it a plate from thin willow board, or calamine, and from things similar to these in lightness, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then bind it carefully over the fractured bone, so that it does not move: and go with the bandage according to the roundness towards the back several times, and tighten it with a decent constriction.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage at all hours, and whenever it softens, tighten it. And if necessity causes it to be loosened because of itching, or corrosion that happens in the place, or pain, or abscess: then hasten, and loosen it, and eradicate the plaster, and correct what happened with the way of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster if you see it forming that face: and bandage it tightly until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in the thick places which follow the back, and from their extremities on the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they do not suffer attrition, unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not concealed from the sense during examination with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And restoration of it is made so that the fracture with the fingers is equal according to the possible manner, until the figure is equal, according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters, and bind the broken bone with a splint if it is needed.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is sloping inwards: then there happens to the sick person a very severe pain, and a piercing, like the piercing which happens to him who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also it happens to him difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting blood much: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And now the ancients have been ingenious in this matter with many ingenuities: and among them are those who say, that you should place foods in the sick man which generate inflammation and windiness, so that the belly may be inflamed, and extended, and the fracture driven to the exterior.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We however abhor that it not be a cause for quickly making a hot abscess, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If this has already happened, then he adds to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: a wind-filled vessel should be placed over the place, then it should be suctioned with force, and this is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Nevertheless, it is feared that it will attract windy superfluities to the place because of the predisposition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said that the place ought to be covered with wool which has already been immersed in hot oil: and let little pads be placed between the ribs until it is filled: so that there may be an equal bandage when you wrap it according to the roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person is treated with treatment for pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the weak body is distressed by something too great for it to bear and the bone pierces the flesh with a piercing point, and we fear for the weak one: then it is necessary that we cut above the place and uncover from the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we place upon it an instrument that preserves the wound's edges, of which the mention preceded; and we cut the bone with ease, and cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we shall bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture: and we shall care for it with plasters, until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If it happens that a hot abscess occurs in the meantime, then hasten and pour in grains in rose oil, and place it over the spot: and let the patient be treated with what is fitting for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, he is also laid on his side on which he sleeps until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of a fracture of the spinal vertebrae of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Sometimes a fracture of the bones of the neck occurs, and rarely attrition happens to them; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back also.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When therefore it happens to someone, and you want to know, whether he will be healed or not, then trust.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	If you see his hand already softened and numbed and dead: and it cannot move them, nor extend them, nor constrict them: and when you constrict them with your fingers, and prick them with a sharp point, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that it is not healing, and in many dispositions it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If he moves them and feels a tightening in them with his fingers and pricking, then know that the nape of the bone is safe, and that the sick person will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If it happens to the vertebrae of the back, similar to this, and you wish to know if it will heal or not: then consider his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and what happened in the hands has happened to them: then when he lies on his back, wind and involuntary defecation occur: and when he lies on his stomach, involuntary defecation occurs: and when he lies on his back and wants to urinate but cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not labor in its cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If nothing of that sort happens to him, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the cure for this which happens from it is, that you try sedation of the hot abscess: so, that you put upon the rubbed (or, anointed) spine only rose oil: or with beaten eggs saturated with wine.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place on top of it several times a day until the hot abscess settles. Then place one comforting, drying plaster over the spot and bind it firmly with a bandage: and order the patient to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Nor should he sleep upon the part where he found pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens that in rubbing a bone is shattered, or something which is already separated from it: then it is necessary, that you cut above the skin, and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some ointment until it heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If the last bone of the thigh is broken and reaches the end of the tail, then you must insert your thumb of your left hand into the anus, and with your right hand, equalize the broken bone as best as possible.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place upon it, and remove it: and care for the wound with the care that preceded, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	On the restoration of the anus.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Bones of Anchars are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If these are broken, then their fracture is not, except for a crushing at the extremities of them: and they are split lengthwise, and they incline inward: and there occurs in the injured place pain and a puncture: and the leg that breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is that you stretch your hand over it until you stand upon the fracture as to its figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in the extremities of it, then equal that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from the equation, until it assimilates to its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If, however, the fracture is lengthwise, or already inclines inwards: then make the sick person lie on their stomach, until you prepare the restoration of that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have leveled it, place on top of it a plaster; then place on top of it a splint of wood or skin: and bind tightly with a bandaging which you do not fear will cause rearrangement of the fracture, nor removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And an equal concavity of them with that which fills it, until it takes it tight according to equality: and order the infirm, that he sleep upon his back, or upon his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If however it happens that a hot abscess occurs to him, then cease from its extension and restoration until the hot abscess settles: and place upon it that which has been said before, then return to its restoration: and tighten it as is fitting.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If, however, a splinter has entered the bone, or it is broken, remove it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the restoration of a broken bone with assistance
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	That which is between the hip and the head is a spatula helpful.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two modes.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of these is: that you take a plank of wood of medium thickness, according to this form which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligaments shall be tied at both extremities.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then let it be suspended from an elevated place: and let the sick person sit upon a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he should throw his broken arm over a piece of wood until it reaches the place where the curve of the wood is attached in the middle.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend something heavy from above so that it extends the instrument downward.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician sets the fracture with his hands until the fracture returns, as is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another way is that the sick person be laid on his neck, and his hand be suspended from his neck with a band.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two assistants to hold one of them who is above the fracture with his hands: and let the other hold below it, and let each of them extend to his own part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish it to have stronger extension, then bind below the fracture with a ligament, and above it with another ligament: and each of the two attendants shall extend it to their own parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder, then it is necessary that one ligament be placed under the little bone, and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a ligament be placed over that place, and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equalize the fracture with ease without effort, until the fracture is made equal as it should be, and apply a good application: then bind it, if there does not occur a hot abscess.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If a hot abscess occurs, then release the constriction until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place upon it wool dipped in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess is quiet: then bind it; and the way of binding it is, as you would place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a bandage made of fresh cloth over the dressing.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then he will bring the arm above his helper, and place his open hand upon his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and bind over the auxiliary arm, so that the arm may stand in place of the stars; if nothing prevents you from this, and nothing is altered upon you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you are afraid that something will be changed on you from a broken bone, then use splints; and it is, that you place over the fracture itself the splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between every splint the width of a finger: and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tighten over the stars the constriction that I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that your constriction be above the place of fracture stricter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more elongated the fracture is, let the constriction be less.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the position of stars and constriction, as we have said, in the hour when you restore the limb immediately do this: and if you fear a hot abscess, then release the constriction and stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament in all three days, so that it does not happen in the place itching, or inflation, or food is prohibited from reaching the limb, because of the arrangement of superfluity of constriction.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore straighten it as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If you are over confident, so that nothing may happen from it: then do not loosen the ligament, unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient's sleep be upon his back, and his hands upon his stomach: and put under the assistance a cushion full of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night, or day, that the figure of a broken limb be not loosened, nor the ligament softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore rectify it with your virtue.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place food for the sick according to the order which we have previously given, so that it be fine food at first, until he begins to tighten his mouth; then it is necessary that you make his food coarser.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	According to custom, the aid and leg should be bandaged for forty days; therefore, it is necessary that it be untied, and a bath be administered, and it be medicated with ointments which straighten it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul and rubbed, then you do not separate it from its ligaments and splints for up to fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of a broken arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones which are called the two radii.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of these is small: and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And another is large, and it is that which is placed below the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore a larger weapon breaks alone, or a small one: and perhaps both break at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore a small upper bone is broken, its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower bone is broken, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when two bones are broken at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is broken is little above the socket, then it behooves the physician at its restoration, to place a small extension with ease, until it equalizes itself.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however the fracture is large, then it is necessary to put a stronger bandaging.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he place the figure of the hand at its restoration, and its extended extension over the pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint be higher than all the fingers, or the rest: and let the weak one sit square upon itself, and let the pulley be before it, or in its direct line, in altitude, so that the weak one does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant shall extend similarly from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician aligns the bone until he restores it to the best possible shape.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If, in a fracture of bone, there are fragments, then try to reduce every fragment back to its place with your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If however it appears to be separated and stabbing the skin, and there is no hope in its restoration, then find over it, and remove it according to the manner which we have said in those things which precede.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If, however, the fracture is with a wound, I have already done so to that particular chapter, therefore take care of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If it happens at the beginning of your restoration that a hot abscess occurs, then line cloth with a cauterized piece made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and thinness: and tightly bind the cloth over it with a fine bandage until when the abscess settles: then remove the cauterized piece, and place a plaster prepared from ground powder with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place splints, and let the splint placed over the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of stars on the arm is six in various arrangements: whether it be a fracture in one fossa, or in two fossae at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your splint over the fracture site stronger and more firm, and a little more with the splint to the upper part of the fracture, or to the lower part of it; or place a softer splint, its edge slightly less, according to what was remembered before at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let cloths be wound over the fracture, soft, moist cloths, and not hard, rough ones.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread for tightening be made of linen, of medium thickness between fine and coarse, as we have recounted.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something happens which requires correction, such as an itch that happens to a limb: then it is necessary to embrocate the limb with hot water until the itching subsides, and let go of the limb not constricted, until it subsides, then repeat the constriction.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the constriction has already been softened, and the bone has already been removed, and similar things to these: then correct it all with your skill, and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	If nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb because of the excess tightness, then it is necessary to soften it a little and let it go for a few days until it heals to the nourishment, then tighten it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, nothing of what we said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary to loosen (it), unless after twenty days, or about so many.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the infirm person shall be suspended to his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let its neck be equal, and may it be guarded by its virtue from agitated motions.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him lie on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of it is according to dispositions of complexions, and dispositions of virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of fractured hands.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fractures of the fingers and the knuckles are rare.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And this does not happen to him unless through much rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore occurs a fracture of the foot, or attrition: then it is necessary that the sick man should sit square and in front of him a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand upon it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then let the assistant extend the broken bones, and the physician straighten them until they are joined together in a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he place a plaster and a wad, if there does not occur a hot abscess.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then put a splint above according to the amount of space: and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If the fracture is near the lower part of the foot, then make a sphere like shape out of cloth: and order the sick person to bind it over the broken foot: then bind it with a long strip of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	Let a pad be made of leather, which has some softness, so that it can be applied to the skin with the body of the plant, and bind it as is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is external, then you must: place one splint above and another below in the sole of the foot; and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a ligature as one turns the hand; and extend it between the fingers with a band.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a fracture happens to one of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it shall be set according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it is bound with a plant, and if you please, put in for it a straight spindle, small: that the fracture may be raised up, and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, index, or little finger, and ring finger, then it should be aligned and bandaged with the healthy finger that follows it; or all of them should be bandaged according to their continuation; and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small bandage over it, as we said about the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the same arrangement of the hot abscess: and oppose with it what is necessary, when something happens from it, according to what the narrative of its recurrence says.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the restoration of a fractured hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is broken many times and is made known to the senses because it turns to the inner and outer part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And restoration of it is made so that a ligament is tightened above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick person should lie down upon his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then he shall extend the entire ligament to its own part according to equality: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If it is a fracture near the root of the hip bone, then one ligature should be to the side of the wingbone, so that extension goes upwards; and another ligature below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus similarly if there is a fracture near the knee, then let the ligament near the knee be, so that it extends to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician straightens the bone with both of his hands, until he brings it back according to the likeness of the natural figure: and the bone is joined together with a good joining.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary, that you place a plaster and a constriction, if an abscess does not occur in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If it happens that an abscess occurs there, then leave it alone for some days until the abscess settles and becomes warm, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	Its stricture should be so.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you wrap a hard bandage over the fracture, namely, twice or three times; and let there remain from it an excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg until it reaches the heel at the root of the foot.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And introduce a long thread between the hip and leg near the knee to the lower part, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over the Leg and Hip what is surplus from the meal.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place upon the hip at the site of its fracture a splint, and place one splint from it on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the cavities between the thigh and hip with soft cloths so that the tightness is equalized.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong constriction in the middle above the fracture site for three, or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more elongated it is with the ligament from the place of the fracture, the stricter and smoother, and gentler will your constriction be.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then attend to the two extremities of the thread that you introduced between the hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore, tie with both three stars which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with two ends of thread to the lower part until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And when both are tightened also the extremities of the stars from the other part: so that the ligament may not be moved from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then loosen the constriction over it while it remains, so that it does not happen to the member, corruption, or abscess, or inflation, and similar things to these.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, with its solution, and rectify that which happened from it altogether, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If there is a piece of bone within a bone that pricks, then it is necessary for you, if it is possible, to make it equal.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find upon it, and remove it: and care with him whose precedent recollection, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is tightened, besides which stars are added to it, as we said in the aid and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of it thus broken, lameness does not occur in the weak person.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if only one leg is restored, besides applying another leg to it, then it is necessary that the one whose it is will always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is taken away: all this is according to the diversity of constitutions and other arrangements.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of a broken kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fracture of the kneecap rarely occurs, but attrition happens there often.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If a fracture occurs to him, then not unless a fissure or hole in his parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is that with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it is placed over the whole with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is so that it may be equal to what was broken from its parts with the fingers until it is brought together, and joined according to what is possible from equality and ease, and fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a plaster of sesame meal, or millet flour, with egg white: and place on top of it a round splint, if the latter is necessary: and tighten from above with a suitable bandage to that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements that we have related in other fractures: such as a hot abscess, and similar ones: so, that you may oppose every accident to what is suitable for it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a broken leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that there are two bones in the leg, one of which is thick and called Femur; and the other thin and called Fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both kinds of fractures that happen to the two bones of the arm: and because of this restoration is made of it, just as the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones are broken at once, the leg turns in every direction.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if a bone is broken more subtly, the leg is turned to the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if a thick bone is broken, you will find it below; and it is among those which are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and equation, and ligation of the stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	Nevertheless, if a fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having many fragments: that the extension be less and with gentler alleviation.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg indeed there is something from the operation above the arm: and it is, that when you equalize the stars, and compile all your operation, then take two fascias from pine wood, which is administered in the making of sun dials that are put under tables: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from them those which have small thickness, and do not be from the smallest: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee to below.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each piece of cloth two foldings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the thigh from one side, and the other from the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie two fasciae in three places from the two extremities and middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	When, however, constriction is prevented, the limb leans to the right and left, and stands in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed let a splint be made from wood according to the length of the leg, and lay the leg in it so that it will keep it from moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And most importantly, you must do this in a fracture when there is also a proper wound with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the bone on every day, and study it with utmost diligence from abscess, or inflammation, or other ailments.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore something of these things happens, then oppose it with that which is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of bones of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A fracture of the calcaneus does not occur completely.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and sometimes also in the fingers. And it does not occur to them except by attrition in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs and you see those bones rising above each other, then let the sick person put his foot on the prepared ground, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand, and put your foot upon that which rises from those bones: afterwards press, or tread upon it: and make it even, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place a plaster, and a wad on top: and place under the foot a small board with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a foot band of good measure, after you have wrapped it with cloths and whatever else it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three days or four have passed, then loosen the ligament.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find bones that are equal, whether they are broken or displaced.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation therefore is, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If some fingers are broken, then restore them and make them equal according to what I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger like a small stick in accordance with the length of your finger, and let it be slightly wider; then place under the foot this table which I have told you about, and tighten it with a decent constriction.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If however that which is broken from the bones is two, or three, or more, then place over every finger a starlet of its own quantity, wrapped in linen cloth: and bind the board to the lower foot: and let it stand on one head of the board outside the foot's belly, so that it may hold good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it behooves you, that you do not forget, but consider all that I have said to you in the remaining fractures from accidents which we have discussed: and oppose every accident with what is fitting.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	On a fracture of the woman's vulva, and of the breastbone, and of the male thigh bone.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's vulva is fractured, then make her sit squarely.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline it toward the back part of him a little, and it shall be held back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife fills the womb with cotton until it is full; and let a sphere be made in the womb from it.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then beat the woman and raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	This one comes out again, until it is made before the gate of the vulva like a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a small thing upon his back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When therefore he wants to urinate, remove the catheter with ease, then let him urinate: and replace it according to the way you inserted it at first: then return to his bed.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let him do this for seven days, or thereabouts, for the bone itself is being restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and place over its opening a reed tube, and introduce the whole bladder into its vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder within the Vulva is inflated, for the fracture will return.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it should be filled with a poultice, and stand for several days, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the breast of a man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and its setting that which we have narrated about the bone of the hip.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not concealed in these nearby fractures, which happen little, especially to one who has some study or use of it.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand this book of mine very well, because the fracture itself signifies to you in many arrangements the straight way in the restoration of itself, and its constriction: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When a man's phallus breaks, take a goose gullet and insert it into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place over it a bandaging from cloth and bandage it, and let it be left for three days, or about that many, and it will heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of a broken bone when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone, or of the arm, or similar to that, to act quickly, and immediately have him bled; if the conditions for bleeding are present, as we have previously stated.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If a wound is flowing blood, then you should hasten to its severing, so that powdered earth may be placed upon it, if you have nothing else.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that very day; and do not postpone it, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If however a hot abscess occurs, then dismiss its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess settles.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And you will not approach him on the third day, and on the fourth at all, for you would cause misfortune to happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If however the broken bone is protruding above the skin and exposed: then it is necessary that you try to reduce it, and level it with your hands with ease and small extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, it is not prepared extension of it, and its equality by your hands; then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And there is an instrument which is made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	Therefore, it is necessary for a physician to take from them three, or four, according to the quantity which he needs for that curing in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it is not doubled upon itself during compression at the time of the operation: and let it have a sharp extremity, which has an edge at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be equal in thickness from the middle to the lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the sharp end be placed upon the prominent end of the bone, and to drive it with one vice until when the bone returns and becomes equal to some equation.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, try to equalize the extremities of the fracture against each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the extremities of it are broken finely, and does not receive it well with the instrument, then it is necessary that you cut the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot restore them with what we have narrated at all, then cut it with what is fitting from the incisions which we have said; or saw it with a saw in any way possible to you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then rasp that which remains in the bone from roughness and tiny bark.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is set, and the weak one finds after its setting a violent pain that wounds, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do therefore that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you will bring great injury to the infirm limb when your restoration is completed which you make of bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in black wine vinegar.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place a cauterizing substance over a wound, nor anything that contains oil: so that it may not cause rot and corruption within it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer splints at the hour of completion of your restoration of bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And let the wound be opened: so that with forceps you make a hole in the folds according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And with all caution, lest you bind a wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many times indeed foolish physicians have done this, and they have caused to happen upon their sick either death, or corruption, or zuchem, that is, gangrene.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your constriction be soft, gentle, different from the constriction of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and fears something of the evils which we have narrated occur upon it, and you find pain in the suspended place: then it is not necessary that you put upon it stars.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them bandages of hard cloths in place of the stars, and bind him with these.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When however it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound already beginning to produce pus in it; then remove from above that cloth which you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer a linen cloth and ointments with which it is our custom to heal wounds, such as ointment of four drugs, and those similar to it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you that you loosen the ligament.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day morning and evening until it consolidates and heals.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared so that pus may run from it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass by a wound and it does not heal, and the pus is not cut away from it: then know that there are small fragments of bone there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore, it is necessary that you inquire about the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those abscesses are separated, remove them, and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those that are not separated from them, and prick the limb, and cause pain to happen, try to cut them, and remove them every way that is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If it happens that a wound is festering, or has a discharge of pus, that is, an abscess, or any other kind of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary to oppose each of these with what is suitable for its cure, whose preceding account is in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And in that which it is necessary that my speech should stand, and to whom you make your present mind when a bone breaks, and protrudes above the limb, like the hipbone, and of the thigh, and similar to them from the large limbs, it is that you do not presume the traction of it, for many times it happens from this death, even let it go, until it rots.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall of itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Therefore, if you deem it necessary, care for the wound; otherwise, let it be.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of a knot in the track of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Many times this Knot occurs in the course of healing a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially that which is near the joints: and it defiles from this figure of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider if the knot is recent: administer to it medicines which have astringency, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and things similar to these.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Therefore, so that you may receive some of these, or all of them: and make them with a stich wine, or with the white of an egg, or with vinegar: and place them on the knot in a wad, and tighten them over it with a good stricture.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And let the stricture be released, and do not delay it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it and repeat another until the knot is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or tighten over the lead plate itself centered.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead is a property for removing all that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If, however, the knot has already been turned into stone and is tight, and urgency demands that it be removed; then cut above it from its upper part, and cut away the protruding superfluity; or shave it with certain razors until it is removed; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	On the healing when it is restored, and the limb remains afterward subtle, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is repaired, and the limb remains after it subtle, weak: then it does not become unless for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of these is the multitude of the solution of the ligament and its ligature not as it ought; or because of the superfluity of the stricture of the ligaments, until nourishment is prohibited from running to the limb; or because of the multitude of superfluous embrocation in the wrong hour; or because of the scarcity of blood in the body of the infirm, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment of this is, to feed the sick person, and make his body soft, until blood multiplies in him.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch over the limb so that it may attract the nourishment of the pitch itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And diligently apply its fomentation with warm water until it drains nourishment and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the treatment of fractured bones when they are set crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that after the healing of a limb there is crookedness, and prominence of the broken bone, or a knot; and it is defiled by this form of the limb, yet the limb is not hindered from its natural operation: then you should not take heed of the speech of him who thinks that the limb ought to be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And now there have been many foolish physicians and restorers who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed blameworthy and very dangerous, leading to death or great fear, so that it may be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and knotting are recent: then it is necessary that it be embrocated with tepid water, in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as the leaves of altaea, and its root, and melilot, and those similar to them.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made for him with a softening plaster, like dyachilon properly prepared.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Either a mucus of althea root is taken and beaten with chicken fat, or sesame oil: and it is plastered on with this.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take fat figs and pound them with dove dung, and similar things which are called from medicines diminishing the consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes a knot is loosened with constant, old-fashioned, and gentle friction, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let movement of the limb be given to every part throughout the hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If the twisting has already preceded, and it has become strong, and it has been turned into stone, and necessity has been brought about for its treatment with iron: then it is necessary that the upper part of it be cut, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and what is superfluous from the knot or bone be incised with delicate cutters; and ease should be administered in it with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On speech in dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is an exit of a certain joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is forbidden from movement, and its figure is defiled by the limb.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And he causes pain and grievous wounds to occur upon the sick person.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore dislocation happens to anyone, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration: and do not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place will become a boil, and perhaps with it a reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it is not necessary that it be moved or extended during the hour of its suppuration.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For often it causes spasms and painful pains.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when this happens, then it is necessary that you hasten to bloodletting of the sick man.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it shall be left alone until the abscess rests.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb will be sutured with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every limb is cured with that which comes to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed arranged the chapters on dislocation, also as before with respect to fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower part of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the treatment of a dislocated lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Two jaws are rarely dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And dislocation of both occurs according to one of two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are removed from their places with slight removal and softened for a short time.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated by dislocation, whole and complete, until they are softened to the part of the chest, until the saliva of the sick runs and he is not able to hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is entangled with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When the dislocation is small, it returns to many positions by itself with little effort.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If it is a complete, entire dislocation, then it is necessary that reduction be administered quickly, and it should not be delayed at all: and let the minister hold the head of the sick person, and let the physician insert his thumb into one side of the jawbone's root between its bones, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he may insert two thumbs at once, if the dislocation is from two parts.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hand be outside, with which he may equal it.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick person to cleanse his jaws and finish them for eating on every part.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician sets the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved, then administer an evaporation with hot water and oil until easy reduction of both is achieved.  Do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and become equal, and the bone of the infirm is closed, and are not softened: then put above them small cakes of cloth, with cerate which is made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it is bound with ease with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the sleep of the sick person be upon his back: and his head should stand between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right or left: nor try, or be compelled to chew anything: indeed put his food in a gentle broth, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is knotted: then eat what he wants, and administer it with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He shall not toil upon the operation of his mouth at eating and drinking, and speaking, until the jawbone is knit together, and has healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, then often fevers and persistent inflammation occur, and perhaps the patient's belly loosens, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When therefore you see this: then know that it is destruction, and many times he who has this dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and the extremity of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The collarbone indeed does not dislocate from the inside, because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is sometimes dislocated to the outside: and that is made known to the sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, that he lie down sick on his back, and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then bind the place with your palm firmly, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place over the same dressing, and pillows, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities which follow the elbow and continue with it, are not dislocated, except rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is dislocated on some day, then it is necessary that it be reduced and made equal according to what we have said, and which has been prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place over the same plasters and pellets and constriction.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the sick person to adhere to tranquility and quiet until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment the extremity of the Humerus is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the reduction of a shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus is not dislocated unless in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of these is that it be dislocated to the part of the thigh towards the lower region.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is, that it be displaced to the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the humerus: and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated posteriorly, because of the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated anteriorly, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And it is most often displaced and moves downwards towards the groin, especially in those whose flesh is little.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it goes out quickly and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those, however, whose flesh is much, there exists the opposite, namely that it comes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people a blow, or a fall, and the humerus becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is thought because of this, that it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, you ought to test it until you stand upon its certainty, and then proceed in its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And it is known that dislocation is when there is a pulling downward of the shoulder; and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a sound shoulder.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find among them a manifest diversity, and you find in the head of the Humerus concavity, and under the little one at touch the head of the humerus as if it were an egg: and the weak cannot reduce his hand to his ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you find a manifest touch, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And the reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent, or when the boy is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, that the minister raises his hand upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under its edge, and raise the joint with strength upward to its place: and the assistant will lift his hand and extend it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he places it lower, for he himself returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If however it does not return by that which we have said, and there are many days from the time when the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the sick person bathe in hot water, and an embrocation be given which softens and soothes, as if roots of althea, fenugreek, and melilot were decocted in water, and be administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient is laid on his back: and under his chest a sphere and wool are placed, which is equal between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician places his heel on the sphere and raises the shoulder with strength, and pulls the hand of the infirm to the lower part.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another assistant shall hold the head of the patient, so that it is not moved downwards: for indeed it returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is, that you make present a man who is longer than the sick one, and stand on the side, and introduce his shoulder under the arm of the sick one: and elevate his arm upwards until the sick one is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another assistant shall draw the hand of the infirm to his lower belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If, however, the weak person is light: then it is necessary that something else be hung with him, so that he may weigh down. For dislocation immediately returns.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is reduced also according to another way: and it is, as if one were to fix in the earth a long piece of wood, whose head be round in shape: like the sleeve of a mourner's robe: that it be not coarse, nor fine.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then soft cloths should be placed under the patient after they have been placed above the head of the wood: and the patient should stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then the hand of him shall be extended to the lower part on the other side, and the body shall be extended from the other side with force: for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If its reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is, to take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width is the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness is the quantity of two fingers: which has a rounded head, so that the entrance of it into the deep titillus may be eased, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are bound over the rounded head so that it does not harm the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then a plank should be placed under the patient's arm, so that the hand or arm can be extended over the wood up to the lower part: and the wood is fastened over the assistant and arm and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm is placed upon the step of the ladder across its width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The junction then enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore the entrance is completed according to whichever way is possible: then it ought to be, that you place under the titillinum a sphere equal in quantity out of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a prepared plaster made from ground flour with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it is turned upwards.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind with a strip of linen under the bandage; and roll the band above the plaster; and attach its hand to its neck, and let it go, and do not move its hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that little food be given to the sick person until the limb is restored; because it is more rapid to its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one is to be placed after seven days, or five, and it is taken out with motion.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it is strengthened and not softened, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If a joint is dislocated many times, because of the humidity that happens to it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that cautery be administered to it with three holes, according to what was said before in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all of this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint does not hold together, and the plaster is reapplied and tightened repeatedly over it, and it does not hold firm, and falls off, and it cannot be elevated to a higher position: then know that the nerves which are to the head of the humerus, have already been cut or stretched or softened: and know that the joint will never heal in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	As for a dislocation that occurs towards the chest and nipple, or to the rear, reduction is carried out with impulse and extension with hands; until it returns, and the rest of the constriction and care are administered until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If it happens after healing that there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then let the sick person use a bath many times, until that heaviness is lessened and it returns to its first nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly it returns with difficulty; and indeed it is dislocated to all parts, and especially to the anterior or posterior.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: because it falls under sight and touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join a dislocated limb with a healthy one, it will be made manifest to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is concave and cannot flex the arm, nor touch its own shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hasten, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess happens to him, its reduction is difficult; and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is towards the rear.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all kinds of dislocations, and of more violent pain; and often death descends with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is one of those things that can be reduced, is, that the hand of him be extended with two hands: and his arm be expanded, and the hands of the physician be above the elbow and below it, and he himself impels the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or if the dislocation is to the front, then it returns so that it doubles its hand with its own hand until it strikes with the root of its palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a violent and strong extension; and let two servants extend the arm, and let two others also hold it, so that it may not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is rolled back to every part after it has been wrapped above the hand with a double length of cloth or a broad bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches a joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil so that it may be one of those things which help in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then drive the joint with a strong thrust until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after setting it, it is necessary that a plaster be placed upon it which has astringency and drying power with the membrane of an egg; and let the bandage be tightened decently.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm shall be suspended from the neck of the sick person: and let it be released after several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it shall be loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the joint is fixed in its place, then loosen the ligament from it, and release it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not well joined, then apply a new plaster and ligament, and leave it for several days until it is tightened.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then dissolve it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If, however, heaviness occurs to him after reduction of the joint, and the position is in motion: then administer humidification in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it straightens, or put on above the hip joint, that is, a fat ram's fleece.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is bandaged, and it is left on it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and introduce it into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore he sweats, then rub the joint with friction tempered.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat upon the same wound with one and then a second and third bath until it softens.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place over it moistened dung of cow, heated with butter, and bind it on top of it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it is softened, and returns to its own arrangement.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of dislocations, Al-Zahrawi.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The joints of the hand are often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Against the other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	Nevertheless it is necessary that speed be in the reduction of a dislocation at the hour in which it occurs, before the place becomes suppurating; or else there may happen to it a hot abscess.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of a dislocation in this is, that you place Mahassem’s hands of the weak hand upon a table, and extend the minister's hand: and let the physician put his palm upon the prominence of the joint, and push it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider, if the palm has already retreated to the belly of the hand: then let the sick person place the back of his hand on a board at extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding toward the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be intrinsically upon the board, that is, the inner part of his hand upon the board, so that the hand of the physician may fall upon that eminence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a soothing poultice for the abscess: and dismiss him, and do not repeat this.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	If he does not tolerate it, and you are unable to reduce it after days have passed, but the joint nevertheless remains according to its tortuosity, and it does not harm the patient except that his hand is softened, and cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves have been severed or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no skill in it unless it is tightened with a cautery near its edge.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it doesn't matter something.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Al-Maghassi returns not, then place upon him the plaster which we have recounted.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is bound and left for five days; afterward it is loosened and left again, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If its movement is hindered and something heavy falls upon it, then soften it with warm water and friction several times until it softens.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from any part, or from the palm of the hand, or from its belly: then extend the finger, and drive back the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and release it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend him and stretch him until he is equal to straight on that day of his.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore night has come, bind him according to the same account: and do not cease to loosen him in the day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days until it tightens.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And similarly do this, if it is dislocated to the belly, hand; and bind him to that part itself, and do with him your first operation, until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly do this when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the lumbar vertebrae.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that there is dislocation of the spine of the back or neck, complete, or many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death hastens the weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the stool of the sick person comes out without his will, and he cannot hold it; and many times some of his limbs are softened, or two legs of him, or two arms of him, or one of them; or a single hip bone is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For it is often removed, which is often removed to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is removed toward the rear, is called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure of this is, as you consider then, if gibbosity happens from childhood: then there is no cure in it, nor is there any healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	In those things which happen by chance, or blow, or similar events, ancients have already spoken of modes of healing in lengthy speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which most does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I myself have now abbreviated from that one, which little excuses itself from much of its proximity to my intention: and in the exposition which I have exposed it, and formed its instrument in a different way from how they showed it and laid it out.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Therefore I say that in a hunchback which occurs from the front part, there is no remedy or cure.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which is done to both sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from these things, except that which happens on the back properly, as I say: and it is, that the sick person be extended on his face on a level platform near the wall: and that a wet covering be spread under him, so that his chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight fixed piece of wood is to be placed in the pit in the ground, at the end of the foot, about its head: and another piece of wood about its feet at the other end of the foot: and let the servant hold the wood, and let it not be fastened in the pit.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another assistant shall hold another.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap above the head of the sick person, and under its hairline a soft, firm bandage: and extend the extremity of the bandage to the wood which is at the head; and bind it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then bind another ligament above its groins, and above its knees, and at its hip joints.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligaments and bind them in a piece of wood that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let every assistant extend the limb to the part of the wood, and let not two ligatures be removed from their places where they are fixed; however, they shall not be fastened, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician places his palms upon the vertebra with strength until it returns; or he places a board upon it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he binds his feet upon the table until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And the cavity in the wall of which we said was near the infirm, place where the end of the board may enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle board over the Spina.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician place his feet upon the other extremity.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And he should bind it well until the joint be contracted and return to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a lathe which is wrapped with your hand: and it is, as you fix in the earth at the head of the sick person at the farthest foot two beams, whose length shall be the length of one arm: and at his head at the farthest foot two beams.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length which is between every piece of wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made in every place, through which a rope runs; and let the whole wood be firmly fixed in the earth very much, so that it may not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And a round piece of wood is inserted; and it is a whorl in which the ligament revolves in two holes of two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole, in which wood is fastened, whose length is a palm with that which turns: and in two other pieces of wood there is similarly that of it.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then bind the ligaments which you have bound in the chest of the sick man to the band that is at his head: and the ligaments which you have bound in his legs to the band that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let there be at every lathe a minister, who twists his hand with linen, with which the lathe is turned; and the physician straightens the spine, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the tourniquet that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the sponge has been returned and the place is leveled, it is necessary to place a dry plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then a plug.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place above the plaster a star made of wood, whose width is three fingers, or thereabouts.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the quantity which it takes up of gibbosity, and above the part of the healthy vertebra.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then a bandage is applied with the ligament which we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the sick person use fine nourishment until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If some elevation remains in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that softening and soothing medicines be administered, along with the tablet which we narrated for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a plate of lead is administered in that.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes there occurs a prominence on the last vertebra of the back: and it is thought to be dislocation through it, and this bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it ought not be presumed that this medicine should be given to him, for perchance it may happen to cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	On the treatment of a dislocated hip joint.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that the joint of the ankle and the joint of the shoulder never occurs except for a dislocation only; nor does it occur to them as happens to other joints by slight removal and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the joint of the Ancha is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Which is, because it is displaced forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	It is indeed most frequently dislocated towards the interior, and little towards the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of dislocation inward is: because when you join the sound leg to the unsound, it is longer; and the knee of it is more prominent than that which is sound, and the unsound cannot double its foot at the groin; and there is a place following the groin, an abscess with hot pus, because the head of the hip has already come there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of him who has a dislocation toward the outside is that those things which are contrary to these happen to him.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of one to whom a dislocation has occurred anteriorly is that he expands the sound leg according to its complement; however, he does not double it without pain which is in the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot go forward over it: and his urine is retained, and his groin suppurates, and in walking his foot falls upon his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of one who has a dislocation to the rear is that he cannot extend his knee, nor can he bend it before he bends his groin: and his leg is also shorter than the other: and his groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation, however, as you consider it, is, if the dislocation is old, which has already aged with the one having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer a reduction of it, and it remains according to its disposition: then there is no treatment at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it is not necessary that presumption be made of him entirely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that case, in which the dislocation is recent, and it belongs to one of the four kinds of dislocation: then hasten to this, so that you will join the joint, and extend it both inwards and outwards, and move it with your right and left hand: for perhaps it will return, and does not need other cure.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If this method does not work, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and he should extend the leg from its lower part: either with his hands, or with a bandage, which is tied above the knee: and another assistant should extend his hand from above, so that he may insert his hands under the pubic bone.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he binds with a soft ligament over the root of the hip, and holds the extremity of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let its extension be either from the front part of the groin to the shoulder blade, or from the back part to the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of all of them be one vice, until the sick person is lifted with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is a common kind of the four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary to do all kinds of that which I shall say about proper cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	When indeed the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that the sick person be laid upon his sound side in reducing it.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he places a ligature over the root of the hip, where it is between the head of the hip and the place which is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upward from the groin region to the higher part of the body, to the clavicle area.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another minister take strong arms and reduce the large place of the weak hip, extending it to the outside with vigorous extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For now it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is easier of cures than the other kinds, in that this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If however he excuses himself from you and does not obey you for the entrance with this kind of cure at all: then it is necessary that two feet be bound together along with a strong, soft ligature above two heels and two knees: and let the length of each be four finger widths from its fellow: and let the weak leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the sick person should be suspended over the head of a log, which is in the house: and let its length from the earth be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong young man to support the head of the hip: and let another support him who is weak when found: and let another young man push, supporting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In setting it properly, when a dislocation is external, it is necessary that the sick person lie on a stool, as we have narrated in one with hunchback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And bind the ligament above his leg, which is weak properly, and above his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two cords are placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a piece of wood is to be placed in the middle of the footbed, firmly fixed: upon which cloths should be wrapped that it may not harm the patient; and let the wood be between his hips so that it may not be pulled down when extended.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let every assistant extend to his part, and the physician equalize the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore he yields to reversion, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place upon the same table, and press it as we said about the prominence, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that the sick person lie on his sound side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the leg of the infirm be stretched quickly: and it is according to this same story on a platform: and the physician puts his right hand palm over the groin of the infirm.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he constricts it with the other hand, and with that constriction puts it extended downwards towards the lower part of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the rear: then it is not necessary for the weak one to be extended downwards and raised above the ground: rather, it is necessary for him to be placed upon a hard object, as is fitting, as it also happens if the dislocation of his arm occurs outwards, according to what we said about his lying on two planks: and it is over his face, and the ligaments are extended, according to what we recently said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that a compress be applied with a board also over the place to which the joint goes out, when reduction is completed as it ought.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend the two legs of the sick person: and when you see them equal, and the sick person tightens his leg, and expands it without excuse: then know, that now the limb returns, as it ought: then join the two hips, and put a plaster, and bind with an imemati, that is, a wheel: so that it may not move anywhere at all: and the sick person adheres to quiet for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligament and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in condition, then know that the dislocation is now firm: therefore discharge the sick person to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then return, and apply a dressing to it, and bind it according to your first constriction: and leave it for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then dissolve it and make it slow down in walking on both sides for several days, until it is well fortified.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	On the dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, namely to the rear.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated anteriorly.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is, that you bid the sick man apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not adhere with the hip: then you shall know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all types of dislocation is to make the weak leg straight, so that it may now extend its leg if it can over it, and adhere your back to its face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then cause his knee to adhere with your palms, and straight make them between your fingers upon his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm both sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another attendant shall extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of recovery is that the leg adheres to the hip with ease, not with effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then place a plaster over it and make the leg adhere to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then tie that with a thread for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let not the sick person walk for several days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If reduction is refused to you, then administer a strong extension with ligaments, the previous account of which in the treatment of the ankylosis, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the treatment of calcaneus dislocation.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	Sometimes the calcaneus is removed by a small incision, and sometimes it is dislocated according to the completeness.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation is made either inwards or outwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, proceeding towards the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its removal is easy restoration: and it is, that it be extended with facility with hands, and be made equal, until it return.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the care of it when it is dislocated according to the completion, it is necessary that you make the patient sit straight; and let him hold him strong by the posterior part of his back, in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold his foot with your right hand from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot in the place of the heel.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot toward you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with two left stitches.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left hand and drive the breast of the foot with the right hand towards the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have narrated.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then press the chest of the foot toward the leg in a third position, and you pull the thread.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns in one or in two according to this mode, and you see the foot equal, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation upon it; for it itself will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If you are prevented from reduction by that which we have narrated: then make the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a small piece of wood firmly on the ground, so that it falls between his hips: and now you have enveloped him with cloth, so that he is not harmed.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the assistant take hold of his hip: afterwards let another assistant extend the foot, either with his hands or with a bandage that is tied above the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let every attendant extend against the extension of his own comparison: and a pad be standing between the two hips of the infirm holding him, so that the body of him is not drawn down in the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician reduces the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant holds the sound leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For a dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore a dislocation returns, and the health of its restoration is declared to you: then place a plaster and a wad, and tightly bind it with ligaments, and tie the foot with a ligament to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And you ought to be careful or fearful of the nerves which are above the heel bone, so that the ligament is not too strong over them and harms them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him be dismissed after two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament is softened, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and forbid the infirm from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If he attempts to walk before that time, it is not safe unless the dislocation breaks apart above him, and it is corrupted, and does not receive healing afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If it happens to him that he has a hot abscess, then you must administer to him the same thing which we mentioned before in another place concerning its cure, and an ointment, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On dislocation of the toes and their treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated be put back in place with little extension without labor; and indeed this is not difficult, but easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If the dislocation is in some joints of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that the sick person make his foot sit upon a level place of the earth, or upon a board: and he stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and place your foot upon that which projects from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press that with your foot with strength until it returns and you see it leveled, and there is no prominence in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under his foot a board which should hold the whole foot, having two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it tightly with a bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it and make him rest from walking for many days until it tightens and is secured by the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the kinds of dislocations with a wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens from this, and you try its healing and restoration, many times death follows: and for that reason it is not fitting that he should presume to cure it, of this kind, unless he is prudent in the art, long used, merciful, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous: and that he should use in the beginning medicines which calm hot abscesses only: and dismiss the sick by divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you hope for salvation from death with gentleness of sickness, and in which appears something of hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt the reduction of it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the limb returns, according to what we want, then administer a treatment that calms the abscess; and care for the wound with that which is fitting for it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with a fracture and these occur in separated bone fragments, then attempt the removal of them, and do what we said in simple ailments from what precedes regarding their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your strength, and guard yourself from entering the way of fear: according to what my prediction has preceded for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more healthful for your body among those in your time.
