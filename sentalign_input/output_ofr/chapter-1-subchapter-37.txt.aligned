Of the disease of the kidneys	On cauterization of the kidneys.	0.46703646
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from great flatulence, and there is no desire for women, then you must cauterize him on the kidneys on one side and the other with the key-shaped cautery that we have mentioned before; and if we cauterize him in the middle, he will have three cauteries in a line, and they will do more good.	When pain strikes the kidneys from chill or heavy vapour, and the patient's sexual vigour is impaired thereby, you should burn him right over the kidneys, once on each kidney, with the claviform cautery mentioned before. I have often burnt him with a third cauterization on the flat of the back, making three cauterizations in a line, which is most effective.	0.69038385
