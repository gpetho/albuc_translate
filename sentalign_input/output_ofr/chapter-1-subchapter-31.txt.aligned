Cautery is not useful for dropsy, except in the manner which is called "ascites".	The cautery is particularly effective in ascites.	0.50246835
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in divisions, and your treatment is not effective, then you must make four cauteries around the groin, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the back on the spine, and one near the chest; and the cautery should be very close to the thickness of the skin.	When you have, without effect, treated a dropsical person with the various measures mentioned in the section on diseases, you should sear with four cauterizations around the umbilicus, and one over the stomach, another over the liver, and another over the spleen, and two behind his back between the vertebrae, one at the level of the breast and one at the level of the stomach; and let the burn be almost skin-deep.	0.8318237
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to drain pus for a long time, and do not abandon the treatment of the patient after the cautery; and healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be combined with God's help.	Then keep the burn open so that it suppurates for a long while. Do not let the patient, after cauterization, be without the necessary treatment, so that you combine both methods for him, and a cure will speedily come to him.	0.7515553
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the key-shaped one that we have previously shown; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what has been stated before.	The cautery with which his belly is cauterized should be claviform like the figure previously given; while the one with which his back is cauterized should be olivary.	0.8455392
