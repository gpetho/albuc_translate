of the distortion of the mouth	Cauterization of the twisted mouth.	0.46870944
A condition that must be treated by cautery is only those that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases; and do not make a cautery for those that come from dryness and nerve spasm.	The twisting of the mouth which is curable with the cautery is of that nature which arises from phlegm, as we have already noticed in the sections on sicknesses. But cauterization is to be carefully avoided in that type which is due to dryness or spasm of the tendon.	0.7389753
It is similar to the "cultellare" that we mentioned before, but it is a bit more subtle and the blade should be a bit thicker; afterward treat the spot as I mentioned before, until it is healed.	It is a variety of the bladed cautery such as has already been described, but is rather more slender as you see. Its blade should have a certain thickness. Then dress the place with what we have mentioned till healed.	0.73083603
