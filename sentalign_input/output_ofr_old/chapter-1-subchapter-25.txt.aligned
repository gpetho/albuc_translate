of the dislocation of the shoulder When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterward, the patient should be laid on his back and side; then lift the core within the titillate with the fingers of your left hand; and if the joint is dislocated inward, heat the cautery with two nerves of which this is the shape:	On cauterization of the axilla. When the head of the humerus is dislocated on account of the synovial fluid or when it does not remain in the correct position after the dislocation has been set, so that this becomes a regular occurrenceâ€”it is set and then dislocates with the least movement, as we have ourselves seen; you must first set the luxation, then make the patient lie down on his back or on his sound side; then with the fingers of the left hand lift up the skin of the axilla if the joint has dislocated downwards. Then heat a cautery provided with two spits in this manner.	0.8528583
and cauterize the core until it penetrates to the ribs, and the shape of the cautery will come with four cauteries; and therefore a cautery is made with the cautery that has three nerves, so the shape of the cauterization will be six cauteries; and the nerves are according to the subtlety of a tent, and this is the shape of the cautery with three nerves:	Then with that burn through the fold of skin till you have perforated to the other side, getting four cauterizations. The cautery may be of three prongs and then the form of the cauterization will be six burns. The prongs should be of the fineness of a probe. This is the figure of the cautery with three prongs.	0.7413386
Sometimes an additional nerve is added, making it eight cauteries.	Sometimes there is added yet one more so there will be eight burns.	0.77489996
Afterward, apply mashed leeks with salt on the cautery; then let the patient rest, and do not move the limb for a long time until it is well strengthened.	Put on the burns leeks well pounded with salt; then keep the patient absolutely quiet so as not to move the joint for a time till it gains strength.	0.8717392
If it is dislocated upward, which rarely happens, then make a cautery on the thickness of the clavicle cautery, or many small cauteries. This will close the joint, remove the moisture, and the patient will be healed.	If the dislocation has gone upwards, which very rarely happens, then cauterize him above the shoulder with one good claviform cautery or with multiple punctured cauterizations. Thus the joint will gain strength and the humidity will disappear and the patient will be cured.	0.8160028
