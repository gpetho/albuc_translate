The second chapter on incision, lancing, phlebotomy, wounds, and the like.	BOOK TWO ON INCISION, PERFORATION, AND VENESECTION, AND WOUNDS AND THE LIKE	0.5396835
Khalaf said: We have mentioned in the first chapter every disease suitable for cauterization with fire and burning medicine, its causes and reasons, its instruments, and forms of cauteries, and I have made that into chapters from the head to the foot.	IN the first book I spoke of all those diseases for which cauterization is of value, either the actual cautery or that done with caustic medicines; and of their reasons and causes; also the instruments and the shapes of the cauteries. This I set out in chapters, from head to heel.	0.7405447
And I follow in this chapter the same path to make it easy for the student to obtain what he seeks.	In this book I shall proceed along the same route so that it will be easy for the inquirer to find what he is looking for.	0.7714486
And before I begin with that, it is necessary for you to know, my sons, that this chapter contains more danger than the first chapter on cauterization, and for that reason, the warning in it should be stronger, because the work in this chapter often involves the discharge of blood, by which life is sustained, when opening a vein, or incising a swelling, or lancing an abscess, or treating a wound, or extracting an arrow, or incising a stone, and similar things, all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and in most of them, death occurs.	But before I begin this you ought first to know, my sons, that in this book there is more risk than in the first, which treats of cauterization. Wherefore in this matter there should be greater circumspection. For in the course of the work of which this book treats there often occurs an effusion of the blood upon which life depends, in the opening of a blood-vessel or the incision of a tumour or the perforation of an abscess or the treatment of a wound or the extraction of an arrow, or in the incising for a calculus or similar cases; all of which are accompanied by uncertainty and fear; and in most death will supervene.	0.8908383
And I advise you against falling into what is doubtful for you, for various types of people may come to you in this profession with various kinds of illnesses, and among them are those who have become weary of their illness, and death has become insignificant to them due to the intensity of their suffering and the length of their affliction, and the illness has reached a stage that indicates death.	So I warn you against undertaking any case in which there is any element of doubt to you; for in the exercise of the art you will be mobbed by all kinds of persons with all manner of afflictions; some being so weary of their sickness that death itself is a relief on account of the extent of their sufferings and the length of their miseries, their illness being so settled as to presage death.	0.8148112
And among them are those who offer you their wealth and enrich you with it, hoping for health, but their illness is fatal, so it is not appropriate for you to help anyone who comes to you with such a condition at all, and let your caution be stronger than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with anything of that until after certain knowledge is established with you regarding the good outcome it will lead to.	Some will lavish their wealth on you and enrich you, in the hope that they may be curable, when their disease is mortal. You should not assist any of this kind who approach you; let your caution be stronger than your greed and desire for gain; and do not embark upon anything of this kind unless you have positive knowledge, which you judge adequate, about the way of bringing the patient a good outcome.	0.8144114
And use in all the treatment of your patients the precedence of knowledge and warning about what the safety will lead to, for in that, you will have help in acquiring praise, glory, remembrance, and thanks.	In treating every patient be prescient and foretell the means whereby health may be restored to him. That will help you to obtain renown, glory, fame, and praise.	0.7222178
May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance, and may He not deprive you of correctness and success. Indeed, that is in His hand, there is no god but Him.	May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance, and grant that you hit the mark and succeed; for it is in His hand; there is no God but He.	0.90785706
And I have arranged this chapter into sections, as presented in the chapter on cauterization, from the head to the foot, to make it easier for you to obtain what you want from it, God willing.	I have arranged this book in sections as I did with the previous book on cauterizations, from head to heel; so you will the easier find in it what you seek.	0.75340873
