Therefore, as Albucasis has completed this book for you, which is the final part of the science of medicine, by completing it you will achieve its end, and by reading it, and by understanding it, I see that I should complete this treatise for you, which concerns surgery on the hand.
Because surgery of the hand is entirely abandoned in our country and in our time, due to great peril, the science of it has diminished, and its tools have been lost; there remain only a few brief descriptions in the books of the ancients, which are mutilated and lead to error and confusion until their intentions are clarified and the strength of it is extended and the art.
And I see that I should bring this treatise to life according to the method of exposition and clarification and abbreviation; so that it comes with the forms of the tools for cauterization and other instruments used in the work, as well as the addition of clarification, and preparation, which is necessary.
The reason that a good artisan cannot be found in this our time is because the art of medicine is long and requires the practitioner to have been trained in anatomy, which includes knowledge of the joints and the shapes of the members, as well as their connection and separation; having knowledge of bones, nerves and ligaments, as well as their number, and their origin; and the recognition of arteries, veins and quiet veins, and the locations for bleeding them.
And as Hippocrates said in his work, "a name is much, but in small things, and especially in the art of surgery."
And we have already said about this in the introduction of this book; because whoever is not knowledgeable in anatomy cannot avoid making errors that can lead to the death of men, as I have seen many times, for some are uneducated in this science and trust in their own ignorance and lack of experience.
Because I saw a foolish and experienced doctor make an abscess in the neck of a woman, and cut some arteries in the neck, which caused a large amount of blood to flow until the woman died among her relatives.
And I saw another doctor who believed that he could pull a stone from a man who was in agony, and the stone was large, but it came out and he cut a piece of the bladder while doing so, due to which the man died three days later.
And I called for him to extract it, and saw that due to the size of the stone and the patient's condition, he would die.
And I saw another doctor who took money from a duke of our land for surgery, and then operated on a black slave who had fractured his thigh; the doctor prepared him with his ignorance, extracted the fracture through an incision, using pulleys and splints with strong construction, but did not allow the wound to breathe.
He dressed the wound according to his desires, bandaged it, and left it closed for several days and commanded that we not undress him; until the thigh and leg became abscessed, and led to ruin.
And I was called to him, and when I undressed the bandages, he found relief from his pain.
But corruption had already been confirmed in the member, so that he could not stop it, and the corruption continued to spread throughout the member until the patient was in danger.
And I saw another doctor who made an abscess cancerous and it became ulcerated after several days, until the evil of it was greatly magnified in the lord.
The cause is because the cancer is pure of melancholic humor, so it does not need to be treated with every remedy, but rather an affected member that receives all its hostility.
And for this reason, my sons, it is necessary for you that surgery of the hand should be divided into two categories: one is associated with health, and the other involves great risk in its execution.
And I have already examined this in every part of this book where there is an operation involving error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to be aware of this and to avoid it, so that the foolish do not deceive you.
And so take up your weapons with caution and protection from God, and your patients with joy and steadfastness.
And use the best way for the grace of God to achieve salvation and praiseworthy success, and leave behind terrible maladies that are difficult to heal, and abandon your fears, so that you do not waver in your faith or your name: for more remains for your glory, and it will last in this world and beyond your sanctity.
Guidance has already been given in some of its teachings: "Do not treat bad disease, so that wicked doctors do not become renowned."
And you have already divided this book according to three chapters.
Commence la division du livre et du premier de la premi√®re partie. The first chapter deals with the feet, in the shapes of instruments and the types of cauteries, as well as what is necessary for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter is about blisters and perforations, about bleeding and ulcers, and about the extraction of boils and similar afflictions, all categorized and arranged in the shapes of instruments.
The third chapter is about restoration and dislocation, as well as the treatment of twists and similar afflictions; the chapter is dedicated to the feet, and organized according to the shapes of instruments.
Know what the quality of the juxtaposed components of that cautery and its potential disadvantages are, and in which circumstances the use of a cautery is prohibited.
Therefore say that the discourse on the quality of the component of the cautery and its disadvantages is long, detailed, scientific, and somewhat cryptic; many wise men have spoken about it extensively, and they disagree on the subject, and I shall only touch upon one of their discourses, fearing to prolong the discussion.
And therefore say that cauterization generally concerns all material or materials, with the exception of two cases, which are cases where caution is contraindicated.
In the case of dry and hard matter, there is disagreement; some argue that caution is beneficial in this case, while others argue the opposite, claiming that caution is not appropriate for sickness that is caused by quality and dryness, as nature itself is both quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient to treat a dry and hard affliction with something that is hot and dry.
And say this about the one who disagrees with that argument, stating that caution is useful for all dry and hard afflictions found in human bodies, as when you compare the body of man and its humidity to the nature of fire, it overpowers the body of a man.
And say this on behalf of the one who disagrees, that I have tried it in certain situations and found evidence to support his argument.
However, it is essential that we examine this matter in depth, as the one who argues in favor of caution has already been experienced and exercised in the chapter of cauterization in past practice, and he is aware of the diversity of human conditions and the nature of their afflictions, their causes, their manifestations, and the length of time for each.
However, in other cases, it is not a matter of fear, especially for soft and moist afflictions, as all doctors have already agreed on these, and they are not divided on the usefulness of caution in such cases.
And sons, understand that the secret of curing with fire and caution lies in cautery combined with medicine, as fire is simple, the action of which only affects the member that is cauterized and does not harm any other member unless there is a small disadvantage.
The action of the medicine burns towards that in the members which it is applied to, and it strongly drives sickness in the afflicted member of difficult healing and strong pain.
The fire, through its excellence and goodness, does not do this only but rather exceeds it, and it is already known to us by experiment and long study of the art concerning the truth of causes; and therefore I am excused for the length of the sermon, except that it is not lawful for me in this pause to reveal secretly hidden by the fire, and the quality of the operation on the body and its expulsion through which you expel sicknesses, philosophical demonstrative speech, which would serve to sharpen your pains.
And know, sons, that they disagree about the time when it is appropriate to make cauteries and pause in the best time of springtime.
I say that cauterization is appropriate at all times, because the harm caused by accidental time is submerged in the advantage of what is attracted by the cautery, and especially if the cautery is for pain or necessary pain, which do not suffer delay, since it is feared that the one who comes with evil intention is greater than small harm entering through the time.
And so do not eat in your feet, or sons, that is not valued except by the common people and foolish doctors, because that illness which is cured by cauterization is not always resolved and they delay its outcome.
And the cause is not as they think for that, because cauterization is only in place of medicine which alters the complexion and dries up the moistures which are the reason for the pains.
But nonetheless, cauterization is excessive over the medicine due to its desire for its power and virtue and the greatness of its lord.
It is possible that the illness may return at some time in the future, depending on the patient's complexion and the location of their illness, as well as its properties, and what is prepared in their body due to the accumulation of superfluidities in them, and what is obtained by them through their diet and similar causes; except that the illness for which cauterization is administered is a subtle illness in parts with few superfluidities and moistures, such as cauterizing teeth for pain and similar, it is possible that in it the pain will not return, but rather a small one.
But the common saying is that cauterization is the last remedy of medicine, and that is incorrect, not according to what I understand in it, because I believe that it is not healing that improves with medicine or any other cause related to cauterization.
The cause is the opposite of that; and the intention that cauterization is the last remedy of medicine is only when we administer the methods of healing in some illnesses, and those medicines do not help, and at the end of the illness, a person is given cauterization, and it improves in it. Here is the correction for the last sentence:
And the ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they did not say this for the equality of gold and the exalted nature of its substance.
And they said that the place of cauterization does not harm, as that is not absolutely true, because I already have this proven and observed that it does not do so in some bodies and cauterization with it is good and better than iron as they said; but when you perform cauterization with fire from gold, it is not clear to you, because it depends on the amount that you want for its redness, and it prepares to receive friction; and if you adjust above the flame, the gold melts due to the heat of the fire, and in the fire some layers are formed so that the craftsman can cauterize through the occupation of that.
And therefore, cauterization with iron should be done gently and then more firmly in order to correct the operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on cauterization according to chapters, and I have also ordered those of the head within the feet, so that you can lighten your request for it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization provides relief from both coldness and moistness in the affected area, which are two causes of scurvy and excessive flow of mucus, called corrhea, from the head to the parts of the ears and nose fluidity, as well as excessive sleeping, tooth pain and gout, and generally all illnesses that come from coldness, such as paralysis, sclerosis, and similar in those illnesses.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: first, you command the patient to be evacuated with a medicinal laxative for three or four nights, according to the properties of the illness, and their age and their habit.
Then you command him to shave his head with a razor and then he should sit on a chair with his feet resting on your hands.
Then you place the edge of your palm approximately at the level of his nose between his eyebrows. But since your hand position is not yet clear, mark that location with a probe and then apply the olive oil-based cauterizer in this manner:
Then you place it there on the indicated location, in such a way that it descends, with your hand moving downwards, and your grip gradually tightens as you turn it.
And then you lift your hand lightly and observe the location, and if you see some amount of bone emerging from the head, such as the size of a grain of wheat, you raise your hand and if it does not return to its place with that iron, another one of it, if it is cold, until the bone is visible where I told you.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the location and leave it there for three days.
Then place a cushion over the wound covered by it, that which should destroy the scar of fire. And apply a plaster containing four medications over the affected area until it is healed.
When the wound remains open for a long time, let it be treated with honey, as it is better and more beneficial.
They say that the vertebra should be burned with cautery and held until a piece of the bone is hardened.
Then scrape off that which is attached to the bone, and let it heal.
Others say that with cautery reaching the bone, it should be strongly applied to the bone until the bone breaks, and this is the method of amputation in small places. They estimate that from that place escape the vapors of the head.
Let the wound remain open for a long time, and apply remedies to heal it until it is consolidated.
I have not seen both kinds of cautery for all cases, but only in some men out of fear; and leave that one, you should do what is better for health, as the head is more susceptible to solubility due to continuity of this kind, as has been proven in other members, and especially when the patient's head is of free nature.
And the first kind of cautery is more effective and should be preferred; and that one and that operation are for the sake of health.
Chapter second.
Chapter of the head cauterization:
When chronic and long-lasting pain occurs in the entire head of a patient, use weapons, scissors, tweezers, plasters, ointments, gauze, needles, liniments, and similar remedies, especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery that does not help in any of those causes, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong creation by nature; and it is not free and has a large inflammation, then cauterize it again with another cautery after a short time. Then cauterize that on the corner of the patient's head with cautery until the vertebra is divided. Cut the vertebra and expose the amount that has been determined and cauterize it with one cautery in the rear part of the head at the location called "vas" - and that is the location where a bladder-like protrusion occurs. And do not expose the bone, because the patient suffers great pain different from the pain of all other head cauterizations.
And say that this cautery is in its place, because the cautery with which the corners of the head and the occiput are cauterized is more subtle than the cautery used for other parts of the head; and this is the method.
Chapter third:
Chapter of modern amputation:
When pain in the head part swells or pain enters into the skull, it should be evacuated with medicines that alleviate the condition, and the other cure (which I have called remedies for illnesses); but if this does not help, cauterization is performed in two ways: either cauterization with a burning medicine, or with iron.
A hot iron tool is taken, sharpened at both ends and applied to the temples of the head. Then make an incision in the location of pain on the temple with a sharp, small knife, but deep enough to create a hollow, yet not visible.
Apply pressure with a cloth on the previously constricted area and leave it for three hours; then remove the linen, and let the plaster remain for two or three days, and place a bandage over the submerged area until the wound heals.
Cure that (the wound) with mouth rinses until it is healed.
And if you wish, do so with some burning medicines that I have written about in the second treatise on burning medicines.
Cauterization with iron follows this method: the form of fire used for cauterization is as follows:
It is called a clamp nail, because the head of it is shaped like a nail with some curvature, and in the middle part there is a small protuberance.
Place your hand over the location of pain, and hold it - so as not to injure the archery which is below - and turn the small iron slowly with speed.
If the quantity that is injured by the tip of the knife is not too much and the hand is raised to prevent the artery which is below from being injured, so that there is no bleeding.
Apply cotton to the area in salt water and let it stay there for three days; then bandage the area with linen, and cure it with mouth rinses until it is healed.
If you wish, cauterize the end of the scythe with caution, and be careful not to make an incision in the artery in this new method which is not traditional.
Chapter Four.
On the ancient method of cauterization for migraines.
When you treat migraines with the remedies mentioned in the previous cure and in the remedies for illnesses, and the cure does not work, or when the disease is not cured by the first cauterization with burning medicine or cauterization with fire, then it becomes necessary to ignite the scythe cautery before it turns white (meaning place a line of long length over the location of pain, the thickness of which is the width of the finger, or whatever that may be); and after waiting a while, press down on it and make an incision in the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to damage the jawbone, which is detrimental to chewing, and that the ligament is not injured and the nerves which support that, and that it does not result in spasm.
And if it is about the care and caution of bleeding from the artery that is cut, because in cutting there is fear, and especially for those who do not know what they are doing and are not learned or experienced; and let the operation begin at the beginning.
I will remember the regulation of bleeding from an accident of the artery according to its method, in its place in this book.
And if you see this disease that is not cured by this cauterization and if you find the patient's body tolerable, cauterize it in the middle of the head as mentioned earlier, and cure the wound until it heals.
If you wish, administer the cauterization that was mentioned in the chapter on compression of the artery with cauterization using two knives, and this is the best and most suitable cauterization.
Chapter Five.
On the cauterization of ear pain.
When pain in the ear occurs due to cold and is treated with cooling causes and the other cure (which was mentioned in the division) does not alleviate the pain, then apply fire, which is called puncta, of which this is the form:
Place the puncta in the fire and bring it to the environment of the entire ear like a wheel that is rolled, or in the vicinity of each example if the pain is in one place. Approach the ear with the cauterizing tool of the razor little by little, but with caution so as not to injure the location you are trying to reach.
And if the cautery of all the points is throughout the entire area, and that which is affected heals, then care for the areas within until they are healed.
If the cautery of all the points is applied throughout the whole region, and what has been affected heals, then attend to the areas affected until they are healed (or cured).
Treatise on Cauterization of Gout.
Gout, which is cured by cauterization, is not other than the species that comes from arrows, as it has been said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterizing the species that enter through dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that species of gout with herbs and purges and ointments, and do not find relief from your treatment, then you must necessarily cauterize the patient with three cauteries: the first one must be made at the region, the second one a little lower near the temple, and the third one should join the edges of two lips.
Place the cautery against the affected part in a manner contrary to the direction of the illness, for relief is not found except at the point where it heals.
The manner of cauterization is to cauterize that part with the cautery in the direction of the end of the affected area, and then a little above the ear, and at the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the finger, and after placing your hand with the cautery over the affected area until it has been burned to the extent that the quantity of the affected part has been consumed.
This is the shape of the cautery, and it is the type of knife, whose shape is flat. However, because it must be very sharp, you should not leave too much excess coarseness on it; it is necessary to grind it in the place of excessive coarseness.
Care for the area with what is before processing until it heals.
Treatise on Cauterization of Burns.
On the Cauterization of Ancient Apoplexy
When ancient apoplexy occurs and the treatment for it has been described but not followed, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize it with four cauteries: primarily on all the corners of his head; and in the middle of his head, as mentioned; and in his neck. And the method for cauterization is done as previously described.
It has already been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; it is more posterior; and it should be cured with what is appropriate.
Chapter VIII.
On the Cauterization of Forgetfulness Caused by Fever.
The patient should be given large pills at the beginning, which will help to purify him.
Then shave the patient's entire head and place an ointment on his neck as described in the treatise on plasters.
Leave it for several days, because this is the method of cauterization. And do as ordered by that medicine, which has already been mentioned.
If it cures well in this manner, then do nothing more; but if not, perform three cauterizations on the lower part of his head, which should descend from the most superior part of his head to the lower part of his neck. Leave a gap between each cauterization and care for the cauterized area with what is appropriate.
If you wish to be more daring and the patient is tolerant of it, then cauterize in the middle; but if you want even more, then cauterize it on both corners.
Care for the cauterized area until it is healed and the cauterizations are olive-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter IX.
On the Cauterization of Paralysis and the Softening of the Whole Body.
Treat the head with pills and what has been mentioned previously; then shave the patient's head, cauterize it in the middle of his head, on all corners of his head, on the lower part of his head, and three cauterizations on the spinal vertebrae of his neck.
And if it is necessary for the softening of the body in cases of dropsy and the patient is tolerant and the disease is strong, then cauterize it with four cauterizations on the spine of the back, and later a cauterization to burn through the thick skin, and raise your hand above it. Care for the cauterized area until it is healed and the cauterizations are olive-shaped.
Chapter X.
On the Cauterization of Epilepsy.
Epilepsy itself is not cauterized, but that epilepsy caused by fever is.
And therefore, you should purify the brain of the patient at the beginning with herbs and the other treatment mentioned in the division when the patient is strong and tolerates the exception of medications.
And if the patient is a child who does not tolerate medications, administer gurgles and teething remedies to help purify him for several days with good food.
Then shave the patient's head and cauterize it in the middle of his head according to the previous method, and another cauterization on the back of his head, and one on each corner of his head. If the patient is strong and tolerates it, then cauterize it with cauterizations as described (paralysis and softening of the body on the spinal vertebrae of the neck and back).
The cauterizations should be olive-shaped, as previously mentioned.
But if the patient is a child, pause with subtle cautery according to this method.
Chapter XI.
On the Cauterization of Melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and a severe fever, cauterize it with the cauterizations as described in the paralysis division.
And if the cause of melancholy is superfluidity that declines into melancholy and the body of the patient is moist, give him what purifies his brain according to what has been described in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, make a tourniquet around it, and leave it in place on his forehead.
The patient should be completely undressed and held from all sides.
A balm is applied; it is more appropriate to use an ancient sheep balm. Heat it over the fire at a moderate temperature, which he will endure when it is placed on him. Place it on his forehead in the circle and leave it until it is absorbed.
And perform this procedure on the patient every week, accompanied by the proper regimen until they are well; or if you wish, cauterize it by making small points according to what is most necessary, unless you have a cautery of this kind prepared: this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain with equal proportion.
Then pause that sore in bandaging or in gray plaster of Paris.
Chapter XII.
On the cauterization of water descending in the bladder.
When you have recognized the onset of water in the bladder by the signs I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient a drink that purifies their head, and keep them away from all moisture.
And make him soak in bath with alum for several days.
Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize that spot on the head with a cautery in the middle of the head; and cauterize it with two cauteries on both temples if there is the beginning of urinary discharge from two bladders, or one cauterization if it is the beginning of water in one bladder.
Make an incision with a cautery on all the veins and arteries that are underneath the coccyx; and make the cauterizations in that long area at the level of the temples.
And be careful to prevent bleeding when cauterizing; and if you see any bleeding, stop it with some medicine that is within your ability.
And I will come with knowledge concerning the extraction of arteries, the incision of them, and caution regarding bleeding.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck on both sides with two cauterizations at the lower part of the neck.
Chapter XIII.
On the cauterization of old tears.
When tears from the bladders are old and persistently caused by veins and arteries manifest in the place of the head outside, and it is verified that it is excessive fluid, then cauterize that with the cautery as mentioned in the chapter on urinary discharge in the bladders, and with a cautery in the middle of the head and two cauterizations at both temples, and two cauterizations at both neck bones. And if it requires addition, then cauterize that on the entire length of the bladder at the tip of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter XIV.
On the cauterization of nose smell (nasal stench).
When you treat that which I have mentioned in the division and your treatment does not improve, then prepare yourself and give the patient chamomile tea for three nights; shave their head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized cautery using olive oil cautery. Then cauterize that on the eyelashes with carnation cautery and two cauteries on both eyebrows above the small hairs.
And be careful not to cut any arteries when doing so.
The form of the carnation cautery is as follows.
Chapter XV.
On the softening of eyelids from the bladder.
When the eyelid of the bladder is softened by disease or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery using this lunar cautery. And here is its form:
And if you are performing the cauterization, do it on both eyebrows with a small cautery and two cauterizations in every section, extending from one temple to the other. Let each cauterization be as long as the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery, but rather according to the thickness of the section of the eyelid that is adhered.
Chapter XVI.
On the cauterization of the eyelid of the bladder when the hair has turned into the sections and the bladder is hardened.
When the hair of the bladder has turned into the sections and pierces the bladder, cauterize in those areas using two methods: cauterization can be done with heat or with a burning medicine.
If a heated cautery is applied to the affected area, tell the patient to lower their pants as they do when washing themselves, until it is prolonged and bound; and if you puncture that area, then bind it with a bandage so that it does not become infected until the skin heals.
Then raise the head of the patient and hold your hand over the eyelids of their wounds with a cloth bearing the symbol of the fern leaf, starting from the skin area.
Then apply warm oil or chicken broth on the wound.
And bring the heated cautery with this shape.
Then cauterize the area marked by the symbol, little by little, with observed burn marks, until the surface of the skin is burned like fern leaves, completely apparent.
The sign of healing from your work is that the eyelid of the wound is contracted and the skin around it raised after the puncture of the wound.
Therefore raise your hand and leave it there for three days, then cover the area with stitches until the scar has healed. Then care for it until it is healed.
If the skin around it returns for any cause and the eyelid becomes soft, then apply the heated cautery to it again in the same manner as before.
If the skin is on the eyelid and it drops down, then cauterize it so that it returns to its original position, closes, and the skin does not puncture the wound again.
If the cautery with medicine is burning this means that you should tell the patient to lower their pants until it is prolonged and bound, and prepare a paper or cloth in the shape of a fern leaf.
And take known sage and fresh cow's urine. .i., And mix these ingredients well, and do it with haste so that it is not spoiled; then spread this mixture over the cloth shaped like a fern leaf, placing it on one or both of the wounds; then cover the wound area with warm oil, and place the patient's head in your lap.
Then place the patient on the medicine and press it gently so that they do not move until they feel the bite of the medicine, for the bite is like fire.
Therefore, when the patient perceives that the herb is biting them, remove the medicine and cover it with your hand; therefore, when the bite ceases, remove the medicine and wash the wound with water; then consider if the eyelid has been lifted like it should be washed with fire or cut, for this is good; and if it does not return to its place after being removed from the medicine on the area where there was no pressure applied, then put the medicine back over that spot until your operation is complete and the wound is healed.
Then cover the area with stitches until the skin of the adhesion is removed, and care for it until the adhesion is completely healed or until it is treated with another method.
And it is necessary for you to keep a close watch during your operation so that no pus from the wound drips onto the medicine; if after several days the eyelid becomes soft and some skin around it punctures the wound, then repeat your treatment over the affected area in the same manner as at the beginning, and continue until it is healed.
This is the form of the mastic tree leaf.
You should know that men's hernias are of various sizes and shapes, so accordingly make your treatment.
Do not hide the path of right direction to him who has studied in this art.
Chapter XVII.
On the cauterization of a fistula which is in the eyelid hernia.
When you treat a fistula as I have said in the division of diseases and do not make your treatment, then you must cauterize it according to this method: command the patient to put his head in your lap, and let some servant hold his head between yours in such a way that he is neither harmed nor agitated by his head.
And place a piece of cotton soaked in oil or bird glue on the hernia of him.
And approach the cauterizing instrument which has this form:
which is hollow, as is the form of a reed or a feather quill, from one end of which the cauterizing tool is made.
If you wish, enter it into the other end. And if you want, withdraw it thus.
However, the hollow one is better for your work.
And press the fistula if it is open, and drain and dry it. If it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.
And place your hand on the cauterizing instrument which is well ignited, and you with your other hand should hold the cauterizing tool at the edge of the nose, so that neither your hand nor the patient is disturbed, and then press the cauterizing tool on the hernia and burn it.
And so if the cauterization reaches the bone at first, that is good; otherwise, you should make the cauterization once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then press on that spot with a linen cloth and cover it with a dry dressing until it heals.
However, if it has passed ten days and is not healed, then press on it with a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and scraped as needed according to its chapter.
Another method of cauterizing a fistula which some people have said is: enter the location of the fistula and close it, then place a fine thread in that fissure, which has the form of a needle: And the quantity of the lead was one inch melted; and you with your hand hold the needle well, so as not to harm the patient because the molten lead should not reach the hernia of him; and it is necessary that you press on the hernia of the patient with cotton soaked in oil or water, for the lead adheres to the location of the fistula and heals it by miraculous healing.
And if the fistula is healed by the cauterization and treatment that I have said, that is good; otherwise, it is necessary to administer nose drops and reduce the fistula into the nose as appropriate in its location.
Chapter XVIII.
On the cauterization of the fissure of the head.
Most often, fissures occur in the lips, especially in children's lips.
Therefore, when you treat those fissures as I have said in the division and your treatment is not successful, then ignite a small, sharp scissors-shaped cauterizing instrument according to this form:
And the concavity of it according to the fineness of the scissors.
Press that edge carefully into those fissures until the cauterizing tool reaches the root of the fissures.
And treat it with a kerocote until it is healed.
Chapter XIX.
On the cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
If in the root of the uvula or in the palate or in the roots of the teeth a pustule is formed and a boil is made, and it breaks, and it becomes old, and it makes a fistula, and you treat it and your treatment is not successful, then it is necessary that you ignite a cauterizing instrument according to the quantity received in the fistula, and then place the ignited tool in the fistula hole, and with your hand bring it to the root of him, and at the end do this once or twice; and treat it with what I have said about treatment until it is healed.
And so if the pus is drained and healed, that is good; otherwise, it is necessary to expose the location and scrape the rotten bone according to its chapter.
Chapter XX.
Treatment of cauterization of teeth and softening of ulcers.
When ulcers are softened by moisture and teeth are damaged, and you cannot heal them with medicine, then place the patient's head on your lap, bring the cautery near that is suitable for this purpose, ensure the patient can feel the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
Then lift your hand, and move the heated cautery several times according to your will.
Then the patient rinses their mouth with salt water and holds it for an hour, then stop it because the damaged tooth is closed, the swollen gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried up.
Chapter XXI.
Treatment of tooth pain by cauterization.
When tooth pain is caused by inflammation or worms, or medicine does not heal it, then cauterize the area in two ways: either with a cowhorn cautery, or with fire.
A cowhorn cautery is obtained by taking a cow's horn and heating it in an iron pot, then selecting a small piece of the heated horn and wrapping it in linen cloth, immersing it in water, and placing it on the painful tooth quickly until it becomes hot.
Then move the heated horn cautery several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
If you wish, immerse linen or a piece of cloth in the hot horn cautery, place it on the painful tooth, and hold it there until the heated iron reaches the cavity of the tooth.
However, the cauterization by fire method has the drawback that you must be careful with the coal or iron, and there should not be any large protrusions in the area to prevent the heat of the fire from reaching the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery in a suitable manner, and place it on the tooth until it becomes hot, and do this several times as needed to alleviate the pain either that day or the next.
And it is necessary to use pressure on the cautery so that the patient holds their mouth open with a good bite and keeps it there for an hour, then spit it out. This is the method of using the cauterization.
Cauterize only the affected area as much as is possible for you.
This is the shape of the cannula (a hollow tube used for medical procedures):
Chapter XXII.
Treatment of hernias by cauterization.
When hernias are caused by inflammation and cold humors that do not respond to medicine and you want to treat them gently, then heat the cautery in a suitable manner (as described below), holding both ends so that the smoke escapes through one end, and apply the heated cauterizer to the abscess for a moment. If necessary, repeat this process until it reaches the base of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then pause the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and apply the linen for three days on it, and pause over the affected area until the fluid inside has been completely burned by the fire.
Approach it with warm cloths and bandages until it is healed.
Chapter XXIII.
On the cauterization of throat warts and constriction of veins.
When humidity comes upon the trachea of the lung, and especially when it is accompanied by inflammation, it is necessary that the patient be evacuated at first with laxative medicines, and then cauterize that affected place at the location of the goiter.
And be careful not to burn the goiter with the cautery or burn its surrounding tissue, but only a little.
Cauterize that affected place at another joint of the neck on the lower spine. The cautery used should be sharp, following the previous method.
Approach it with the warm cloths and bandages until it is healed.
Chapter XXIV.
On the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are due to humidity, the patient does not have a fever or thick phlegm, and it is an old sickness, then cauterize that affected place with two cauteries on the furcula at the tender spots on both sides; and with another cautery in the middle of the thigh between two nipples; and let the cauteries be sharp, following the previously described method.
And if you wish, your cauterization can be made with the type of cautery called a punctum, which is described in the treatment of ear pain.
And place points at those areas; and approach it with warm cloths and bandages until it is healed.
And let the cauteries have three arms, since cauterization is done with this method: once a day you can perform three cauterizations in this manner.
Chapter XXV.
On the cauterization of twitching, which is the head of the assistant.
When the head of the assistant is displaced due to lubricating humidity and does not return to its place during the time of its return, then you must bring it back until it has returned to its usual position, and you must gently move it so that it can be dislocated in the opposite direction, as we have witnessed, then you should first reduce the displacement, and place the patient on their back or on their side; and raise the surrounding tissue which is inside the area of the twitching to the upper parts with your left hand if the joint is displaced internally.
Approach with fire the cautery that has two heads, and this is its shape:
Approach and cauterize the surrounding tissue so that it penetrates through to the other side, and the figure of cauterization will then come out with four heads.
And adjust it according to this count and because there are eight cauteries.
And pause over the cautery for a time with salt, and place the patient in quietness, and let the affected limb not be painful for any length of time until it is comforted.
And if the displacement is at the upper joint and the humidity is removed as described earlier, then you cauterize over the muscle with a sharp cautery or multiple pointed cauteries, since the joint is confirmed and the humidity is drained and the patient is healed.
Chapter XXVI.
On the cauterization of the stomach.
When there is movement and humidity in the stomach that spreads throughout its expanse and multiplies its rooms, and if you continue with the methods of treatment but it does not improve, then you must place the patient on their back, extend their arms and legs, and approach with three cauteries: one cautery below the thigh at the thickness of a finger, and two cauterize below the ribs of the caution, until the triangle-shaped figure of the cautery appears; and elongate those that are not aligned to produce an opening.
And if the depth of the cautery is two thirds of the thickness of the surrounding tissue.
And the shape of the cautery should be as follows, without addition. If you wish, cauterize with the large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape; and let this be a cautery shaped like a circle according to this shape:
And if the stomach is to be cauterized in the one who is afraid of this cautery: and it is that you sign on the stomach according to the amount that you wish to test, and then cauterize that spot with the cautery at the points; and then care for it with the treatment that follows until it heals.
I apologize for the confusion, but there seems to be a missing part in your text.

On Cauterization of the Frightened Pulse (Title)
When pain arises in the feet due to coldness, moisture or excessive gas within it before being displaced from its normal position by excess fluid, and the patient is cured with what has been said and nothing more, then it is necessary that the patient lies on their back, and three cauterizations are made according to this form and quantity on the feet behind the hip bones, the one on the side of a man's decubitus.
And let the space between each cauterization be according to the thickness of the foot, and let the cauterizations be in line with the length of the body straight.
And do not press too hard with the cautery.
And if the amount of the medicine applied is not appropriate to the size of the wound, and it is not properly adjusted; and if the patient stands on their feet; and if they are not standing, then let them sit, which you have already spread their legs, and raise their arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauterizations with a surgical knife, when you have the skill and discretion in the art.
Be careful not to overdo the cauterization, and be sure to disinfect the entire wound so that the entire body is affected and reaches the intestines, for the wound here is delicate; and know this.
I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here is the translation of the text you provided:
On Perforation of Foot Apostema with Cautery (Title)
When an abscess or apostema arises in the foot and you want to know if that apostema is in the flesh of the foot or in its sheath (tunica), then if it is in the flesh of the foot, the patient feels heaviness and pain without being aggravated.
If it is in the sheath (tunica) of the foot, pain becomes intense and often exhausts doctors treating it.
Therefore, it is necessary that the patient lies on their back; and show the location of the abscess with a finger (or other pointing instrument); and ignite the cautery, similar to a rag, in the form described in the previous page. Cauterize with that and cauterize the abscess until the entire wound is burned (coagulated), until it reaches the cavity, until pus comes out.
And care for it with the treatment of other abscesses until healed.
It is not necessary to use this type of cautery unless it has been studied in the art of medicine for a long time and in which many diseases have been known; however, it is better to learn about this operation by trying it several times, but do not neglect it, and it is best.
Capitol .xxix.
On Cauterization of Plaura (Title)
The ancients performed cauterization of plaura (plague) by burning it with a long dry cautery from the art of surgery in this manner, and you will take one of the long dry cauteries found from the art of surgery, and let it be of the thickness of the finger.
Let it (the cautery) be submerged in oil and ignite it in the fire, then cauterize at that location which is between the continuation of the collarbone and the neck; and with two small cauterizations on each side, one slightly descending below the beard, and two cauterizations in the area that descends between the fifth rib and the sciatic notch, descending a little towards the back; and another in the middle of the foot; and another on the stomach, and three cauterizations at the sides of the body; and one cautery in the location between the shoulders, and two cauteries on either side of the foot, below the cautery that is between the shoulders.
And it's not necessary to close your hand around the cautery, rather let it be in the open during the operation.
And some ancient men used a cautery of iron similar to a ray and heated it up. They placed that in the location between the ribs until they reached the abscess and it was opened, as we said in the abscess of the foot.
However, there is no fear during this perforation with the cautery, because death often occurs in the place of the fistula where no healing takes place.
Chapter 30.
On the cauterization of the liver.
When treating liver disease with the methods we have mentioned for division, do not use your own method, rather cauterize in that area according to three ways, all of which are permissible, of which one is to make three or four stitches along the length of the liver according to the figure of the cauteries in the foot, whose figure has been previously described.
And the thickness between each cauterization should be the size of a finger or slightly more, and the method of cauterization should be the same as the method we mentioned in the cautery of the foot.
And do not close your hand around the cautery; rather, let the patient lie on their back.
And another method of cauterization is to ignite the cautery with two prongs, as we have mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of muscles, and lift the skin that is at the end of the liver so that the patient can lie on their left side.
And your elevation should be such that you lift the skin according to the length of the body, so that cauterizations can be made according to the width of the body.
And bring the two prongs together, ignite them quickly, and penetrate the skin of the other part at that point.
And remove the cautery; therefore four cauterizations are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three prongs.
And take care to cure the cautery as it has been said to soak it in vinegar for several days, because that is more effective than the other causes mentioned in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
On the cauterization of hydropisis.
Cauterize not in hydropisis, but in an artery properly.
When treating hydropisis with the methods we have mentioned for division and you do not use your own method, it is necessary to cauterize with four cauterizations around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another cautery on the foot, another cautery on the liver, two cauterizations between the vertebrae of the back, and a cautery in the center of the leg, and another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be appropriate for the thickness of the skin.
And let the cautery be soaked in vinegar so that it can be used for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient from treatment with the cautery without those things that are necessary for healing, and rather hasten it with assistance.
The shape of the cautery used to treat the abdomen should be as described before, and it is that one which is used to treat the back, according to its previous shape.
Chapter .xxxii.
On the cauterization of feet and on sores.
When the feet are swollen with edema and filled with stagnant water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the heel at the point between the little toe and the big toe, and lift your hand off the cautery and do not twist it; and raise your hand, and do not return it completely, because the stagnant water runs out.
The cautery is made in this way: Place two cauteries on each sore, and in each sore make a cautery with the tip of the cautery knife. Make the cauteries in accordance with the length of the sore: Place one on the left side and the other below the middle of the sore; and on each sore two cauteries.
When the wound remains open for a long time because some water persists in it.
And take care of those causes that we have mentioned.
Chapter .xxxiii.
On the cauterization of abdominal organs.
When an abdominal organ becomes weakened and humidity enters it, causing its digestive and retentive functions to weaken, which are in the stomach and the intestines, it is treated with various methods of treatment but does not improve, and sometimes the patient suffers from cauterization with a strong cautery, then cauterize that area with a large cautery on the stomach as described in the cauterization of the stomach, with a circular cautery and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a sharp cautery; and with a cautery on the incision on the side of a large alkatin or with two cauteries.
And if excessive humidity persists and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize that area on the pelvis and intestines, and apply two strong cauteries to the stomach near the inguinal region, because this is a perfect cure for the problem, without any error.
Chapter .xxxiv.
On the cauterization of ancient hemorrhoids.
When ancient hemorrhoids are caused by nature or thick humors or decayed humidity, and are not cured with the methods mentioned in the division, then cauterize it with three cauteries on the tip of the coccyx at the base of the small triangle, and with a cautery above the navel through both sides.
And if you suspect that the stomach of the person is swollen and the food inside it is not spoiled, and the face is sometimes swollen, then cauterize it on the stomach with a large cautery as described earlier; and with one cautery on the liver, and another cautery on the spleen with a sharp cautery, leave the cautery open for some time until it heals.

Here comes the translation for the title:
When gout occurs with swelling and moisture, it is forbidden to engage in sexual activity, and the menstruation of the person is spoiled and delayed, and there will be pain in that area, which requires that the location be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said in the treatment of the bladder; and with a cautery on the lower part of the foot, or with two cauteries, and let the cauteries be long.
Chapter 40.
On the cauterization of the dislocation of the ankle.
When moist humors are poured into the ankle joint and cause swelling of the joint site, and it is recognized that the limb becomes extended beyond the other when compared with it. And the location of the dislocation is located where there is a break.
Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the ankle joint with a circular cautery because you will have signaled the circle around the joint as it rotates in this way, and in this way the joint falls into the center of the circle.
And let the cautery mentioned above be used in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present with you, then cauterize it with three cauteries and a large olive-shaped cautery.
Let the cautery be made according to the size of the wound in its entirety; and take care of it until it heals.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain occurs in the ankle joint and is caused by cold and moisture, the patient is treated with the medicine that we have said before and do not confuse it with another, which is ancient, and therefore it is necessary that you release the patient from thick humors using fumigated pills or artificial pills or similar, and then cauterize it.
The method of the cautery in that case is according to two methods: either cauterizing with burning medicines, or cauterizing with fire.
If according to two known methods, one of which is that you cauterize it on the ankle joint with three triangular cauteries in this way: make sure they are at good depth. And let the space between each cautery be the size of a finger, and if it is a large olive-shaped or round cautery.
Sometimes the cautery should be on the other side of the ankle joint, where there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle whose shape has been described in the cauterization of the ankle dislocation and which contains and burns the entire wound.
And this is the method of cauterizing in sciatica when pain is located at the ankle and does not extend into the limb.
But if it extends into the limb, then you cauterize it with two cauteries on the limb at the place where the pain is located; and with one cautery over the hip for a short distance.
And if it is a cutting cautery, let the depth of the cautery be according to the size of the wound.
And if the patient has pain that extends to the location near the feet, then you cauterize it here where the pain is located with a three-point or four-point cautery or more as needed.
And if the patient has pain behind the thigh, then you cauterize it here with a cutting cautery.
And in all cauterizations be careful not to burn the nerve or large vessel, and for this reason you will harm the patient unnecessarily or cause contraction.
And I have seen one and another of those who cauterized over the hip and ultimately in the cauterization, the leg swelled up to the foot, and the fire burnt through and rotted the entire foot. And beware of this solution for the stomach, for it is fatal.
If the pain is in two joints, then cauterize each one according to this method.
The wise say that in the cauterization of the ankle, this is the method of the cautery: make it in the shape of a circle of iron with a circumference equal to that of a palm; and let its orifice be according to the thickness of a date seed or a little more.
And inside that circle should be another third; and the space, which is equal to the knuckle of the thumb, should be between them; and those circles should be opened in two parts; and the length of those keys should be one or two knuckles, and make the edges of iron in those circles well decorated; and this is its form:
Then heat it in the fire until it becomes red-hot and emits sparks, and then place it on the divided part of the thumb, with the patient holding onto the sides. And therefore, cauterize that area with three cauterizations in one session.
Leave it alone for three days, apply a dressing with bandaging and leave the wound open for several days, and treat it with a mouthwash until it is healed.
Diyas Albucasis: or my sons, we have rarely used this type of cauterization due to the fear of its appearance and because few have found those who observed it.
Moreover, of the various cauterizations, it is the one that alleviates pain and finds the location of it.
Moreover, cauterization with medicinal powders should be done in two circles, each having a perforated armillary sphere containing the iron hook at its bottom; the length of the wall on the inner circumference should be two knuckles or whatever is appropriate.
And if the space is equal to the thickness of a finger, it should be opened both below and above, and they should contain the following:
Then place it on the divided part of the thumb, with the patient holding onto the sides, and compress your hand on the divided part of the thumb; then take some hot water in a bowl, mix it between two circles, and let the quality of that be similar to a small fire slowly growing, hold it for about an hour, and make the patient endure the biting and burning sensation - for that reveals the pain as if from fire - until the burning sensation stops.
And then lift your hand with the instrument and wash the hot water from the entire thumb with warm water.
Leave it alone for three days and place the dressing on it until the blackness of the burn has subsided, leave it alone for several more days, and it will heal; this is the last step in treatment.
Treat it with a mouthwash until it is healed.
If the pain extends into the abdomen or chest, make a statue of it that contains water in the same way as was done for the thumb.
This is the method of hot water, and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medicines. The recipe is for lime and vinegar, each part divided one, and mix and let it rest in a new layer of water, where the other part is perforated with a small hole according to the amount that enters it.
Let the other water layer rest for some time, then pour over it alive lime and vinegar which takes up those (impurities) with a finger, and when you compress them with a soft cloth for good compression, let the hole that came from the sharp water in the other water layer close.
Then adjust all that water, and pour over it more alive vinegar and fresh lime, because at this point it will be of strong acidity, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterizing other members, as this operation works by heat.
These are some of the medicines that require cauterization in a wide area, such as tar, honey, and vinegar mixed with sulfur.
The Gallic remedy from an ancient man is described for the operation and cure of pain in the loins and sciatica, and it is truly a great one, and says that no other treatment is needed, and it heals quickly like this, as recommended, because the person who tried it before confirmed it.
This means that green mustard seed should be taken if a spasm is detected, but if no spasm is found, ripe figs should be taken instead; and it should be mashed with a little salt and placed on the area of pain (loins, chest, or legs), and left there.
This means it should be left for three hours or the amount that the patient can tolerate with moderation regarding the adjustment.
This means bring that person to bath and when their body is heated, immerse them in the sun, because the pain will stop and it will heal.
This means you should know that it is not necessary to use cauterization with these medicines, but rather the purification of the body.
This passage appears to say that according to Hippocrates (Escorides), when a vein is stretched with a sheep's wound, it should be cauterized and this will improve the situation; the cauterization should be done in this way: take wool and immerse it in old oil, and place it between the toes and the hollows.
Then take a dry sheep's wound and inflate it with fire until carbon is formed; then place it on the wool and let it enter where it is stretched. This means apply this (remedy) and do not stop until the sensation of the bite reaches the loins and the pain subsides.
This means that this method of cauterization is called cauterization by cows (or cow branding).
This is likely just a Roman numeral indicating chapter 42. Without more context, it's difficult to determine what the exact meaning or relevance of this number is within the text. It could refer to a specific chapter or section in a medical treatise or other document being discussed, but further information would be needed to accurately interpret its significance.
This means "on the cauterization of pain in the teeth". This suggests that the text is discussing a method for treating tooth pain using cauterization or heat application. The use of this treatment on the teeth may be intended to alleviate discomfort, promote healing, or stop bleeding caused by an injury or infection in the mouth. Without more context, it's difficult to determine the specific details of this treatment method.
Some pains occur in the lower part (of the body) due to various causes, such as injury or trauma, or excessive discharge, and similar causes, by the infusion of cold and moist matter.
Do not use cautery except in this special case, which is caused by an effusion (overflow) of cold matter.
Therefore, evacuate the patient using pills and similar substances, which should be placed on the affected area where there is pain three fingers' breadths in length according to its latitude (depth), but not more than two cauterizations or more, depending on the tolerance of the patient and the potency of the substance.
Make a cauterization with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauterizations using a medium-sized needle in the following manner:
Chapter 43. This appears to be a chapter title in a medical treatise. The Roman numerals (capitolo xliii) are often used in medieval texts, especially those influenced by Latin. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning of this line.
On cauterization at the beginning of jaundice. This appears to be a topic or subject related to the previous chapter title (Chapter 43). However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning and relationship between these lines in the text.
Many times this disease begins in small children; and the sign of its onset in children is that it occurs during their development, causing swelling and elevation (enlargement) of the structure, along with movement. It's possible to interpret this as a description of symptoms related to jaundice or liver issues, but without more context, it's difficult to confirm this interpretation.
And it thickens in the lower vertebra of the back and those closer to it, which begins to protrude above the other vertebrae. This statement appears to describe the progression or location of a condition affecting the spine or back, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of this issue.
And so when you see this and wish to prevent it, cauterize it with a circular cautery in the following manner: This sentence suggests that the previous description of a condition or symptom is something that can be treated or prevented through cauterization. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the treatment being discussed. take the cautery and apply it over the entire affected vertebra. This statement appears to describe a specific action related to the previous description of treating or preventing a condition affecting the spine. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of this treatment or its intended purpose.
And if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery, two or three fingers' width. This statement seems to describe the specific method for carrying out the previous suggestion of applying caution to treat or prevent a condition affecting the spine or back. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of this treatment and its intended purpose. These points should be close together. This statement appears to provide guidance on the placement of cauterization points during the treatment or prevention of a condition affecting the spine, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature and purpose of this treatment.
And provide care to the area where healing will occur with what has been mentioned (previously discussed). This statement appears to suggest that the previous guidance on cauterization is intended to promote healing in the affected area, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature and purpose of this treatment.
Be careful not to use cautery in jaundice caused by nerve spasm. This statement appears to provide a caution or warning against using cauterization as a treatment for jaundice that originates from nerve spasm, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the reason for this caution and its significance in the overall discussion of treatments.
Chapter 44. This appears to be another chapter title in a medical treatise. The Roman numerals (capitolo xliv) are often used in medieval texts, especially those influenced by Latin. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning of this line.
On cauterization for gout and joint pain. This appears to be a topic or subject related to the previous chapter title (Chapter 44). However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning and relationship between these lines in the text.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. This statement appears to describe a condition related to the joints or muscles of the body, specifically gout, which is often characterized by painful inflammation in the feet. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature and purpose of this discussion.
Therefore, since gout is treated by a cold treatment method and the pain is not cured (resolved), you should use cauterization as a last resort. This statement appears to provide guidance on treating or managing gout, suggesting that cauterization may be an option when other methods have failed or are ineffective. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of this treatment and its intended purpose.
And you cauterize (the affected area) around the joint of the foot, close to the evacuation point, using multiple cauterizations. This statement appears to provide specific guidance on carrying out cauterization as a treatment for gout or other types of joint pain in the feet. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature and purpose of this treatment.
The olive oil cautery should be shaped as follows: This statement appears to describe the specific form or shape that a certain tool used in the treatment of gout or other joint conditions should take, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature and purpose of this treatment.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. This statement appears to provide guidance on carrying out a specific action during the treatment of gout or other joint conditions in the feet, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature and purpose of this treatment. If the pain spreads into the toes or other joints, and this happens frequently, you should cauterize (the affected area) over each toe with three or four cauterizations using the olive oil cautery over the entire affected area. This statement appears to provide guidance on managing or treating the spread of gout or other types of joint pain in the feet, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature and purpose of this treatment.
If you find that multiple cauterizations are necessary for this treatment, you should cauterize (the affected area) and avoid pressing too hard with the cautery beforehand, only surround the wound with the cautery. This statement appears to provide guidance on performing cauterization during the treatment of gout or other joint conditions in the feet, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature and purpose of this treatment.
If the pain spreads into the toes and the foot, you should administer the cautery as previously described in its corresponding chapter. This statement appears to provide guidance on managing or treating the spread of gout or other types of joint pain in the feet, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature and purpose of this treatment.
If the pain is only in the toes and it's called sugar, you should make a point at the base of the nail (cuticle) rotating around it as needed, making points along those two lines. This statement appears to provide guidance on treating or managing gout or other types of joint pain in the toes, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature and purpose of this treatment.
If the pain persists in the toes, then make a point on the circumference of each toe and on the nail of the hand.
If the pain persists for several days in the toes or muscles, then cauterize all parts of the joints.
Do not remove the patient from good care and medication regimen, for if good care is provided and this cauterization is performed, he will be healed (God help him).
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization of ruptures.
When a rupture is found in the groin and intestines are brought forward towards the genitalia, as it begins to heal, you must command the patient to fast on his own day and use gentle remedies for the fissure that has formed in his abdomen.
Then follow the patient with your hand on his back, and command him to keep his own excrement contained until it is either expelled or the intestine or hernia appears.
Then return to the place where the fissure is and try to close it over the pelvic bone, using your hand to indicate the circular area at the upper parts of the divided body.
Then heat the cauterization instrument that has the following form:
until it is hot and emits sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then you place the cautery over that mark with your hand holding the cautery in position, and you insert the tool into the hollow of the patella towards the middle of the thigh; and repeat the process if you did not succeed in entering the bone during the first observation.
Observe carefully the intestine during the time of your cauterization, to ensure that you do not burn the intestine and thus cause death or other great harm to the patient.
Know that when you do not touch the bone with the cautery, your operation is in vain.
The cauterizing instrument for children should be fine and small according to their size.
Care for the area of the cauterization for three days with a border until the scar from the fire has healed.
Also care for that [area] with other ointments until it is healed.
The patient should remain lying on their back for forty days until the area and the wound are sealed.
It is necessary to pause the food intake of the patient according to the length of their healing time, and that the intestine does not come out under the strain of healing.
When it is time to lift the patient after forty days, first administer the medicine carefully, and keep them for another forty days.
Let him rest from work and replenishment of food and drink, and from violent speech, for if he follows this regimen of healing completely he will be cured.
I will explain the healing of ruptures in other parts of the stomach, and at the beginning, if possible, without pause, you should cauterize the rupture with a circular cautery according to its size, and it must be cauterized as the third part is done; and then care for that [area] with what has been said before, and do not neglect it.
It was first said by some that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this way, as it is called "the tent" [method]:
and a line is placed perpendicular to the length on one side of the rupture, and another line above it; and then place your hand with a sharp pointed cautery, but the first cauterization should be lighter and more effective.
Chapter forty-six.
On the cauterization of twisting (torsion).
If pain occurs in one of the limbs by accident or blow and persists for a long time and does not respond to treatment with medicine, then it is necessary to cauterize it with a pointed cautery.
The cautery should be of the appropriate size and quality for each member, considering their magnitude and smallness, virtue and power, location of twisting or pain in that member.
Therefore, if it heals with the first cauterization, that is good; but if not, repeat the cauterization on it; because it is common for such pains to spread from one member to another adjacent member, so you must try to reach those with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter forty-seven.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Some leprosy cases can be treated with cauterization as a great benefit, and mostly if the type of leprosy that is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
Therefore, if you want to cauterize it, consider whether the leprosy is common and can be cured with what has been said in the division [of leprosy] without spreading or not, and fear that corruption may spread throughout the patient's body and affect all of their complexion, then cauterize it on the head with two cauterizations: one in the middle of the forehead, and the second below it, extend the front to the end of the hair; and both above two horns; and one behind, on the nape or neck.
Finally, hold the cautery a little way from the bone until a small indentation is made, and then scars are displaced, so that the expiration of thick vapors is relieved from it; and cauterize over the moles as prescribed.
And if the leprosy has already spread on the patient and appears manifestly, then it is necessary that you cauterize it with the cauterizations that have been mentioned in the head; and cauterize on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations over both temples, and two cauterizations over two vertebrae of the neck, and six cauterizations over the vertebrae of the back, and a large one near the coccyx, and one on the coccyx, and two on the heels, and one on each heel, and two on the elbows, and one on each elbow, and two on the wrists, and one on each wrist, and two on the knees, and two on the thighs, and two on the tendons of their feet; and cauterize it over all the joints of the hands and feet, and over each talon of their feet, and over the phalanges of their hands.
And be careful not to burn the nerves that are on the talus [bone].
Some observations are cauterized on the bones of the pelvis with a cautery, and some on the mouth of the stomach, and others on the liver.
Know that the more cauterizations you apply, the more beneficial and helpful it is; know that the patient does not feel pain in the cautery, just as they do not feel it when heated water is applied to them, because the body of the patient has already been stunned.
The cauterizations should be large or small according to the members and joints, depending on the pre-application of the spices of the instruments.
Apply the cautery with flour of earth mixed with honey and the other treatment until it heals.
Chapter 48.
On the cauterization of stupor (stupor means stupor or coma in this context).
When a member becomes stationary or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, but does not heal, then you should cauterize that member as it deserves according to the size of the member or its smallness.
Let your cautery penetrate into the flesh a little. Place it (the cauterization) on the tongue until it heals.
Sometimes, the coma (stupor) of the head or feet, and the spine of the back is cauterized, and the symptoms of the nerves that affect that member are removed, and the coma is cured.
Do not presume this unless he who knows the anatomy of members and the exit points of nerves throughout the whole body is present.
Chapter 49.
On the cauterization of cancerous growths (albaras means "cancerous growth" in this context).
When you perceive it is old and does not respond to any of the remedies of medicine, then you cauterize over it with a hot cautery for a short while according to the size of the lesion until the whiteness and the color recede and the color changes.
Then treat that ulcer with peas and lentils boiled in rose oil and arnica leaves, and with pigeon's blood or yolk of an egg, each part separately and all mixed together, then cover it with a cloth and let it be until it is healed.
Section .1.
On Cauterization of Scabs.
When cancer begins and you want to remove it, then cauterize that with a circular hot cautery in the area around it as it is rotated.
And the wise men say that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle place; however, I do not agree because I fear that it will become an ulcer, and I have already seen this happen several times.
And it is more appropriate that it should be cauterized around it with a circular cautery as we have said, or with multiple cauterizations.
Title .1
Treatise on the cauterization of gout.
When an ulceration is delayed in ripening, either due to excessive moisture or the patient's condition being weak and elderly with little blood, or due to time, and you wish to speed up the ripening of the ulceration; then cauterize around it with a small number of cauteries punctured in a circle; and apply leeches to that which will hasten its ripening.
If you wish to perform perforation with a cautery, hold the cautery in the appropriate location of the ulceration and wait until it penetrates the skin.
If the cautery is in a lower location to alleviate the body, hold it there until the area heals.
Title .12
Treatise on the cauterization of corrosive sores.
A corrosive sore is rot in the body, which consumes it like fire eating dry wood.
Therefore, if you see a corrosive sore in an area where cauterization with fire is appropriate, hold the cautery with large and few nails as necessary in the location of the rot.
And completely cauterize that area until you eradicate all the rot and there remains no cause of it.
Apply leeches to that area for three days, and place it on the cauterized areas soaked in oil mixed until all scars are eradicated and all the rot is gone.
Treat carefully that flesh producing pus.
If the flesh is born healthy for three days without corruption, that's good; otherwise, you must apply a hot iron to what is rotten in the corrupted areas.
Corrosive medicine is used sometimes with sharp medication because it is halfway between a hot iron. However, the cauterization with fire is only slightly beneficial for pus.
I have already said the treatment of it with sharp medication in the previous section, and so take that when you need it.
\[No direct translation is needed for this line as it simply indicates a new chapter.\]
On the cauterization of nails and other similar things.
Motas often occur on the sides of the foot in a disease called clawfoot, which is large and deep-rooted, surrounding the foot; and cauterization in these cases can be done in two ways, namely cauterization with fire or cauterization with hot water.
However, cauterization with fire is the one that ignites a concave-shaped cautery similar to a bird's beak, which should be made of iron in accordance with the size of the clawfoot on all sides, and it should have thin edges.
Place your hand on the burning cautery over the clawfoot, and move your hand around the clawfoot with the cautery until it reaches the depth of the clawfoot. Leave it for three days until pus begins to flow. Cover the area with a plaster made of bad herbs crushed with salt, and leave it on for a night, as this will remove the root of the problem.
Treat the affected area with general flesh-producing medication until it heals.
If it does not heal, and motes continue to develop on the surface of the body, especially on the back and feet, you must administer cauterization with hot water in these cases; take a cup made of glass or iron or a bird's beak, and place it on the clawfoot; then pour a small amount of hot water into the cup, hold your hand over it, and rotate the cup around the clawfoot with compression of your hand from all sides, pressing against the edge of the cup at the root of the clawfoot, allowing the hot water to flow into the root of the claw; wait for an hour for the patient to feel the heat of the hot water on the affected area, and then remove it, as the clawfoot with its roots will be eradicated.
And do this to all such cases until they are healed completely.
Treat the pus that arises when the roots of the claws are eradicated with general flesh-producing medication.
\[No direct translation is needed for this line as it simply indicates a new chapter.\]
On the cauterization of tremors.
When tremors arise due to irritation of a nerve or fever caused by irritation, or for any other similar reason, you must cauterize it with four cauterizations or with five on the spinal bones, between each spinal bone there should be one cautery; and on the limbs and stomach, use olive oil as a cauterization.
The tremor will subside, and the healing of the illness caused by irritation will hasten.
\[No direct translation is needed for this line as it simply indicates a new chapter.\]
On the cauterization of sudden hernias in the body.
When the body has a hernia and produces pus-filled holes made of corrupted materials, at the onset it is necessary to cauterize the entire length of the fistula with a thin, pointed cautery infused with myrtle oil that is then ignited; or with a long lancet from erestology; or with a slow cauterizer.
And at certain intervals, the cauterization is performed at the start of its expulsion according to this method; and it is not believed, and the redundancy is destroyed by performing it, and it heals from those.
But nevertheless it should be done with appropriate evacuation through leeching.
Chapter LVI.
On cauterization of blood flux due to sudden wound by incision of an arrow.
At certain intervals (after the arrow wound has been incised), the flux of blood is stopped by pressing down on the wound itself, or by the incision of an abscess or cauterization of the member, and in such a case, it often remains difficult to heal.
Therefore, whenever it happens (to stop the blood flux due to an arrow wound), you should press your thumb on the opening of the arrow, and wait for a certain number of intervals until the bleeding stops by itself, and does not come out again.
Then wait for the olive oil cauterizers (cautery sticks) to become hot and burn slightly, by counting a certain number of breaths, and blow on them until they are heated enough.
Then take one of the small or large pieces and place it on the location and wound where the artery has been broken, pressing firmly over it until the bleeding has stopped, and then cauterize it before the vessel has become narrowed and constricted.
And if the blood is expelled from the opening of the artery when you press it and withdraw the cautery, then take another cautery from among those that have been prepared in the fire, and continue to perform this procedure until the blood has been constricted.
And be careful not to burn the nerves that are nearby, and let another person approach the patient with evil intentions.
Know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to constrict the blood in such cases, and even more so if the artery is large, unless by one of four methods: by cauterization as described above, or by extraction without cutting off (the extremities), since when the extremities are burned, the blood is constricted; or by binding it with a ligature or bandage for strong compression, or by placing medications over it that have the property of constraining the blood; and they should be strengthened with pillows and tight bandages.
But one who administers proper compression with a bandage or by placing hot substances and similar causes should not be trusted.
But if this happens to someone who is not the doctor or has no medicine, then apply pressure to the wound on the opening of that vein as described above, and understand the great compression until the blood has stopped flowing from the superior part of the wound, and do not press on the arrow; and over the arrow, sprinkle it with cold water of great refrigeration until the blood is congealed and thickened; and in cases where cauterization or medication is necessary.
On incision, perforation, wounds, abscesses, and similar things.
As we have said in the first capital, all diseases in which cauterization with fire is appropriate and medication that burns are indicated, as well as their occasions and causes, and the instruments necessary for them, along with the forms of cauterization; and I have arranged the chapters from the top of the head to the feet.
And we shall proceed in this capital according to that method, so that the one who desires it may be relieved, therefore do what has been requested.
And before I begin this (new subject), son, remember that in this capital is explained what has been mentioned in the first capital of cauterization.
And because it is necessary to be extremely careful, since in the operation that will be described in this capital there are many evacuations that involve blood, from which life depends, therefore the vein must be cleansed or an incision made on the abscess or the opening of the wound or purification of the sore or extraction of a thorn or incision of stone and similar things. And with all these (procedures) should come fear, trembling, and in the worst case, death.
And I advise you to be very careful not to let this happen (to yourself), since sometimes you must behave like healthy people in the treatment of various diseases. And there are some who will die from their own disease, and you must be vigilant because of the severity of their illness, and because of the long duration of their illness, and fear that illness which is a sign of death.
And those who give you their possessions and call on you for help, hope for your health; but their illness is harmful.
Therefore you should not agree to this (treatment), and your caution should be greater than greed and rapacity; do not presume any cause without certain knowledge that confirms it, and to which the patient can give his consent.
And use the prognosis and indication of each of your patients (for treatment), since in this case you have help with acquiring fame, memory, praise, and glory.
Oh, sons, may God inspire your understanding and not lead nor protect you, for that is within His power.
And this chapter is divided according to the previous one concerning cauteries, regarding the care of the head down to the feet, so that you may be relieved of the matter and the need for which you inquire.
First Chapter.
On the treatment of water contained in a child's head.
You should know that this illness, observed in children, occurs during childbirth and when the mother squeezes the child's head with excessive force.
Sometimes it is caused by a hidden condition which is unknown.
I do not see this disease except in children; and as for all those whom I see, it seems to me that they are destined for death, and thus it appears to me that the work is in vain in them.
I have seen a child whose head was full of water, and his head was so swollen inside that he could not stop growing due to the size of his head, and moreover, the moisture increased until he died from burns.
And this water either accumulates between the skull and the bone or collects beneath the bones around the fontanelle.
Because the operation in that case is when the water accumulates between the skull and the bone and the abscess is small, then it is necessary for you to make an incision in the middle of the head with a slit along the length, and the length of the incision should be about two fingers' width until the water runs out, and this is the shape of the spatula:
And therefore, if the water is more greatly increased and the abscess is larger, there are here two incisions according to this method:
And if the water is beneath the bones, it is indicated that you see the corners of the head opened on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you press it with your hand at the corners inside and it is not hidden from you. It is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the head with three slits according to this method:
Extract all the water; close the incisions with gauze and feathers; bind it up above with oil and bandages for five days, remove the linen and treat the wound with poultices and ointments, keep the head straight and immobilize it; feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until the member is comforted and healed.
Another method of incision considers the size of the abscess and the collection of water, because sometimes it is greater in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the left side; and therefore, pay attention to the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear, and perform it as is most possible for you.
And be aware that do not incise the artery and allow blood flow, as the patient will die from the flow of blood with drainage of water.
Third Chapter.
When an ulcer or tumor occurs on the eyelids or foot, and it is old and does not respond to medication, then the final treatment in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
Therefore, when you want to incise those arteries of the patient's head, first clean the location with rough fabric to reveal the arteries, and keep the neck of the patient straight with a cloth; and consider where the vein pulses; and press on each side on the locations that are appropriate for the auricles, and they will only appear in some men.
And use a probe on the artery and incise each one with a sharp spatula pointed towards the bone, and let that be for the length of the head.
And if you want to, insert the spatula next to the artery and break it at the incisions above.
The length of the incision should be adjusted to two fingers' width, for when any vein is incised, blood will be expelled with pulsatile escape, which may jump out frequently due to its pulsation.
But if the artery does not appear at the joint, you must measure the space of three fingers from the elbow and press down with your thumb into the bone.
And the quantity of blood that should be let out is about a cup full (unc.). And it is not necessary to let out more or less than this, and all of this depends on the quantity which appears from the virtue of the patient and the replenishment of the artery in their leg.
Then examine the wound and, if there remains any cause of suppuration on the bone, cut it out to prevent the formation of an abscess.
Then clean the wound with feathers and linen cloth, and care for it with salve until it heals.
Chapter III.
On the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When an old or new ulcer appears on the temples due to acidity and humidity in the folds of the temples, or when it is an old one that is vehement and similar to those, and it has been treated with the methods of medical care but does not improve, we have therefore turned our attention to these diseases by extracting the arteries in the temples, or cauterizing them as shown.
The method of operation and extraction of these vessels is to shave the hairs which are on the temples; and understand that the artery appearing in the temple is indicated by its pulse, which is revealed by its pulsation, but it is hidden except in a few people due to weakness.
If it is hidden, you must hold the patient's head with some cloth; and press the area with a rough cloth or evaporate the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly. And then you take the probe with this shape: And you score the skin with the probe until you reach the artery; and then make an incision in that place and extract it at the upper edge, extracting it from the sheath and uncovering the layers underneath.
But if the artery is delicate, you must wrap it with the tip of the scalpel, and then make a small incision at that place according to the length of its extremities and compression, and do not allow blood flow, for if they are not incised, the blood will not come out from all.
And evacuate about a cup of blood. up to three times (if necessary).
If the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with strong silk thread or cord, and do not allow decay before the wound heals and avoid blood flow.
And cut off any excess tissue between the linen cloths, doing so at that time or another.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery directly into the bone with a cautery cutler until the edges are incised, and remain in the location of that operation.
It is better if the patient has a fever or is in a hot and humid environment; for cautionery is of those causes that help to stop humidity, so it is better in this case as well.
It is necessary to carry out the extraction of arteries in a clean and secure place, and they should be kept covered with appropriate powder, and treated with dry medications that cause the flesh to dry up and heal with cold water until it heals.
If during another visit blood flow occurs from the artery while you are working, you must then take steps to stop the bleeding, either with cautery or by covering the location, and press your hand on it until the bleeding is stopped. If any cause of this does not present itself to you, you must then cover the location with your thumb until the bleeding is coagulated, and plug the area with hot water until the inflammation subsides, and press firmly as needed.
And one thing that is easier in the extraction of arteries is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, since you have pressed down on both ends, then releasing them, until they reach the bone and incise the vein at two points, so that the length between its extremities can be elongated, for it is not consolidated in all places with this cautery.
And here is the shape of the cautery:
The distance between the two blades should be even. But if the gap between the two blades is less than even, it is better, for if they are as sharp as two close blades, they will not cut the flesh with speed.
Therefore, since there is some roughness in them, the heat of the fire should be kept in them and the flesh should be cut lightly.
And this operation is better in all operations and easier as well.
The space between the two blades should be the size of the thickness of the finger.
Chapter IV.
On the care of lungs with acute and acidic tears of the kidneys.
When there are acidic tears, and those veins are located on the top of the head and do not contribute to any cause of medical treatment, and at times the patient's face turns red and they feel tingling in their forehead as if it were ants crawling, and the holes of those become stretched out, moistened so much that their skin is known, and their eyelashes are scalded by the acidity of the tears, ancient remedies were used in treating these with this operation, and I name this treatment as spassa.
It means: And you command the patient to raise their eyebrows which are on their forehead, and then make three incisions in the forehead, equally spaced according to the length of the forehead. If the length of the incision is two fingers: The first incision should be equally distant from the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of a small movement of the eyelashes which are near the lacrimal duct, and the third on the other side.
And keep away from the incision of the arteries which are on both sides, and extend your hand from the continuation of both jaws. If the space of each incision is adjusted to three fingers.
And if you have a sponge soaked with vinegar or dry cloth, apply it to the wound and extract the blood.
Place a spatula with two sharp ends on this incision, whose shape is as follows: that is from the partition of the temples to the second incision. Scrape with it completely the cartilage that is between two incisions and apply it to the middle incision. And place this spatula and enter it again into the first incision using another tool called a scalpel, sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
And pause the sides of that sharp scalpel, separate the attached tissue from the cartilage, and cut through the cartilage to reach the midline, and divide all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
Make sure the incision continues as far as the cartilage appears, and apply it to the midline up until the other incision.
And let the bleeding subside before squeezing the clots of blood with cloth.
And pause in each incision for a suitable length of time, and place on top of the powder that has been steeped in vinegar, oil, and sour milk, making sure it does not form an infected cauterization.
On the third day, remove the linen and administer a large infusion of hot water or tea, and apply it with a basilica paste mixed with rose oil and other things until the sores are healed.
Chapter V.
On the treatment of tears due to catharsis and the eyes descending from within the head.
When there is sharp and continuing catharsis, and at times the eyes of the patient are stretched out slightly, and their look is debilitated, and the eyelids have ulcers and the eyelashes fall out, and in the forehead there is a severe pain that extends, it means by these events that the matter and catharsis do not come from any other veins except those within the head.
And the best treatment for this is as follows: command the patient to raise their forehead, and make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, small in length (and it starts from the left temple to the right temple; it should go through the bone; extend your hand away from the eyelashes which are painful due to mastication), until the bone is exposed.
Squeeze out all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth and fill between the lips of the incision with cotton wool or dry linen. And apply on top of it powder steeped in vinegar and oil to prevent the formation of an infected cauterization.
And when you remove it and see that the abscess has diminished, it is necessary to scrape the bone starting from where there is no longer flesh, and apply it with a drying treatment, as if you took two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mixed them together, and made an ointment out of it and administered it on those sores near the skin.
Chapter VI.
Of the care for what catches in the ears.
All causes that catch in the ears are of four types: either it is a mineral stone or similar to one, such as iron and glass, or it is from a plant, such as wax or beans, or it is fluid, such as water and honey and their likes, or an animal.
Therefore, when a stone or another similar cause that does not fit or grow in the ear occurs, and the ear is blocked, expose the ear to sunlight. If you see the stone, then distill it with some volatile oil or sizam, and administer its extraction. Then make the patient sneeze with certain conditions, and close the nose with a cloth so that the sneezing event occurs. Then place some small pieces of fabric or wool on the circuit of the ear and extend the ear at its openings, as these causes are often forgotten with this method.
If it is not resolved, administer the extraction using the instrument called a gynecological spatula, of which this is the form:
If the stone is forgotten with the gynecological spatula, that's fine; if not, administer the extraction with a thin probe of minimal doubling.
Therefore, if the stone is not forgotten with this method, make a tube of steel and insert the tip of the tube into the ear canal and close its surroundings with wax and softened oil to prevent it from being opened except for the tube. And pull out the air with strong attraction, as many times as you have recognized it.
If the stone is not forgotten with this method, take some alum or vinegar prepared with which birds are pressed a small quantity and place it on the end of the ray, then cover that area well with a suitable cloth. And insert it into the ear canal with ease and excise the ear with moisture.
Therefore, if the stone is not forgotten with all the methods you have recognized, then take care to cut off what grows in the form of an abscess or spasm.
The method of cutting off what grows is that you first puncture the patient's saphenous vein and extract blood in accordance with its virtue, then place the wax between your hands and turn the ear to the openings, and make a small fissure in the root of the ear, pushing out the pus from the area most pressed. Let the fissure be in the shape of the moon so that it reaches the stone, and if the stone is protruded, remove it with appropriate instruments; then stitch up the fissure at that time with speed, and care for it until it heals.
If the cause that falls into the ear is one of the fats that grows and swells, administer its cure and extraction; but if it does not obey your intention, then take thin tweezers in the following form: and administer the abscission of that fat which fell into the ear.
Do not do this when you think that the fat is already moistened by the steam of the ear, and place it on various pieces, then extract it with tweezers or a gynecological spatula, or abscision as described earlier, as the extraction is alleviated.
But if water enters the ear, it is necessary for the patient to sneeze with certain conditions at the beginning, and fill their ear with some old substance, and rub over the ear in which there is water, and if it is forgotten by this method, that's fine; otherwise, take many small tweezers and leeches according to the length of the finger, heat them up slightly in the fire, and let the patient insert one of those into their ear canal and sneeze on one side of that part, then strike another pebble against the pebble that is inside the ear. Therefore, do not stop until all the water is forgotten (removed).
Therefore, do not stop until all the water is forgotten (removed). And once the water has been removed, take paper or gauze. and dip the one end of it into the ear canal, then extend the other end into the fire until it is burned off.
And take another piece of gauze and do this several times until all the water is removed, and strain it with a canal as described earlier for removing stones.
In the extraction of an animal, if it is a small one and similar in appearance, treat it as mentioned in the division; but if it is a large one that causes swelling at the opening, then administer the extraction with caution and skill, and it is easier to handle than all other causes found in the wound.
In the extraction of a worm born in the wound, when you treat it as mentioned in the division and in the treatment of distillations and do not consider your cure, then you must be cautious to observe the wound on the soles.
And if any cause of worms appears here, then extract it gently or subtly, but if no cause is found, then take a thin and wide syringe in the form of this: Insert the thin end of the syringe into the wound according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; and suck it out with strong suction, and do this repeatedly, until all the worms have been expelled.
But if the patient does not improve with treatment, then you close and seal the circuit of the syringe with wax as mentioned; then administer distillations that have been proven effective in the treatment of worms, and observe the effect in the treatment of distillations.
And your effusion with which you infuse the medicinal oils into the wound using this instrument, whose form is as follows: Make it of silver or brass, thin in width, with a small hole, and flat on top.
And therefore, make it as they push to keep the syringe in the concavity of the container here where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take the rod and cover its end with cotton appropriately, then pour oil or juice of some herb, or whatever medicine you choose, into the depression of the instrument ‚Äì which is inside the wound ‚Äì, then insert the rod with a suitable amount of pressure and squeeze it until the oil is expelled in the depression of the instrument and the patient feels the oil within.
And what is to be infused into the wound should already be slightly heated with fire. And ensure that the cause to be distilled in the wound is not too hot, as medicines for wounds do not tolerate such heat.
Chapter VII.
On the treatment of abscesses in the intestines.
Some infants' bellies that have not been perforated develop abscesses, and this happens in some men as well; an abscess in the meat of the intestine due to a wound or rotten flesh in that area; sometimes this abscess is formed near the site of the hernia that does not heal, and at other times it is located outside the incision.
The abscess that occurs near the site of a hernia that does not heal is in the greater dispositions for difficult healing.
In the abscess where healing is achieved, it is necessary to have the patient open the hernia on the sole and observe it. And if an abscess appears to have healed, open it with a thin spatula, whose form is as follows:
If the extremity in which it is small in width, of which one part is sharp and the other is not; and the spatula is two lion's paws wide so that it does not harm the ear.
And therefore, if the opening is for flesh born in the ear or in the meat of it, then you shall take a sharp and pointed instrument and make an incision with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
And if the opening is in the front of the ear, take a thin iron rod and heat it slightly, and then place it in the meat of the ear.
And therefore, if there is an opening with something that the patient experiences relief from, due to the pressure being relieved, force the opening further with ease, but be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
And place a linen cloth on the ear according to the size of the wound that you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the healing of the wound, or take some other substance and immerse it in water and grind it into powder and use it as a compress on the wound, and if you see the ear already healed, then you must remove the substance and replace it with another that you will wrap in wax that is made with rose oil until the cauterized ulcer gives way; and take care of it until it is healed.
However, if there is bleeding, immerse a sponge or cloth in hot water and place it on the ear, and use the other treatment that restricts the flow of blood, which is called in the treatise of distillation.
Chapter VIII.
On the treatment for inflammation that affects the eyelids.
Inflammations of the eyelids, which sometimes occur with swelling, are sometimes dry.
Therefore, you must have them held or tied and incise them with a spatula of their roots, and place compresses on the areas.
However, if pain accompanied by bleeding occurs, you shall cauterize them with a thin lid-cautery.
And the best cauterization is when incisions and swellings return when there remains any cause of their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter IX.
Treatment for swelling that affects the eyelids of humans.
Swellings that occur in the eyelids of humans due to a cause similar to swelling in its strength and duration are called by this name.
It is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper and lower eyelids.
Therefore, the operation is that you consider whether the swelling comes from something that appears on the eyelid and affects it all around; and the cause of this is light.
Therefore, make an incision along the width of it, and remove it from all sides with ease until it drains, and suspend it with a ligature and separate it.
If the figure is large, you shall adjust it with sutures; and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, you will not suffer harm for that because the blood of it will restore and fleshes over.
And if the swelling is declining into the parts within the eyelid, you should remove the surface inside the eyelid, drain the eyelid and suspend the swelling with a ligature, which you do not need to incise, and press it from all sides, and if the eyelid is elongated by an incision, then do not perform this operation for any reason.
And before the incision, wash the hands with salt water; and treat the area with whatever causes it to heal until it is healed.
Chapter X.
On the treatment for excision in the upper eyelid of humans.
Excision is a growth that arises in the tunics of the upper eyelid, and it is more common among children, aggravating their eyes and causing them great pain; and they cannot endure the light of the sun because tears flow towards them.
And therefore you sometimes see them on their faces all the time, and on their faces when they sleep; and sweat is present on their lower eyelashes, which has already been inflamed, and the imminence of adhesion appears in the eyelid; and that when you press the area with your fingers, you feel it adhere to them.
One method of operation is in that the patient places his head on your lap and places a cloth and something warm over it, and make a circle according to the size that contains arsenic from all sides, and place it on top of it and press with your fingers all around so that adhesion is formed in the middle of the circle, and then make an incision in the middle of the moisture with a spatula, and the incision should not be larger than the incision made in flap surgery.
However, in the opening, it is important that you cut open the abdomen completely up to the navel, because in many cases hernias may be found in the abdomen through a rupture, according to the form of a white growth.
Therefore, you should remove those with clothes that you have wrapped around the abdomen between your hands in front and turn it over with your right and left hand until it is separated.
Make sure not to touch the tear, so that you do not cause the sponge to enter the wound and contaminate it.
If an artery does not appear in the beginning of the tear, then you should touch the tear with a small cloth for processing the hernia; and take it out as previously said, and immerse it in water and vinegar, and place it on top of the area and squeeze it tightly with powder.
Then, let those who crush salt squeeze that in the concavity of the tear so that it removes the remaining moisture from it.
And then care for that until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs in the cauterized spot, then care for that with a plaster made of cedar until it is healed.
Capital .xi. (This is the end of the text. It seems to be a medical treatise about surgical procedures, such as treating hernias and cauterizing wounds.)
On the ways of touching the wound.
When in the eyelids of a wound there are swellings due to the pressure of the natural hairs and old age, then we must touch the wound and make ways for maladies such as constant tearing and softening of the eyelids and cloth over it until that is the cause of the destruction of the eye which is called touching the eye, and cure it in four ways: or by cauterizing with fire; or with acute medicine as mentioned before in the chapter on cauterization; or by touching through incision and suturing; or by cannula as I will say.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold the patient's head in your hands; turn the upper eyelid with your left hand, if it has turned, it is good; and if not, insert a needle into the one on which the lid separates from the lower part, then pass the needle through faithfully, and it should be - near the margin of the eyelid where no hairs grow - close to the skin, and pull the thread above the eyelid and turn that one towards the eye.
Then make an incision at the corner of the eyelid below the hairs aligned with the lacrimal groove and pass the spatula into the smaller lacrimal duct; then extract the thread and place a powder or fabric piece under the palpebra, and hold it open with tweezers, and it should be like a fig leaf of myrtle.
However, the shape should be according to the degree of eyelid swelling, because this varies among men, as some require a large incision according to the degree by which the eyelid is swollen.
Then make an incision with the spatula along the two lines that you have marked, starting from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller one. And if your incision is near the natural fissure like the thickness of a king's finger.
Then place the uncus in one of the two angles of the conjunctiva, and remove it completely; then adjust the scissors to cut both labia and gula or thin thread, clean the blood, and let any excess thread adhere over the eyebrows for some reasons sticking, if you want to do this, otherwise do not care.
And keep the stitching of the thread inside for three or four days, and take care of it.
If you want, leave the wound without stitching, and care for it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid should be elevated due to the healing of the wound and its aggregation; however, stitching is better, and therefore according to the ancients, this is recommended.
But in any case, it should be applied to the patient, and it is good practice, and there is no reason for fear.
And another method in treating is to place a piece of myrtle leaf over the eyelid in this manner: then lift the eyelid with three separate and grouped uncus in this form:
But if that is not possible, use the uncus; and when you cannot do this, take a needle with thread and insert it in the middle of the figure, then enter another thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and the other thread near the smaller one, adjust them equally between your fingers, and with these raise your hand with the lift described earlier, raise the entire conjunctiva over which the mark was made as we have recommended.
And then adjust both lips of the wound with stitching and care for it until it heals.
But if an abscess occurs in your incision or wound, treat it with caustic and similar substances, and with gentle washing.
And sometimes the eyelashes turn inside, then you should use what we have said for incision; but stitching is more artificial in some cases.
To drain with reed is like this: and you turn the eyelid and cut the figure that is inside as I have described; then prepare two reeds or two thin stilts whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of the spatula. And you have already made an incision at the corners of each partition, where you have the threads.
Place a thin layer of the lower eyelid tissue under each partition with great care and tighten the reeds of each partition with strong tension, leave that for several days, because the conjunctiva will die from the tension and become detached and will eventually fall off by itself.
But if it is delayed, break it with tweezers, and care for the wound until it heals.
And when it is consolidated, the eyelid is lifted and the hairs do not touch.
And this is the shape of two reeds that you will make in this manner: and have the width and length neither more nor less.
Chapter XII.
On lifting of hairs touching the eyelid with a needle when the hair is hard.
When non-natural, hard, sharp and irritating hairs touch the eyelid, the operation is that you take a thin needle and adjust it with soft thread and leather; then carefully align its extremities without moving too much. And let the length of the fields be equal to that of a palm.
Then draw another thin field beside it in brief and use its ends as you wish.
Place the patient's head on your lap and let it be close to you so that your work is visible, for it is a subtle and small operation.
Insert the needle into the appropriate spot on the shaved area with care, ensuring it enters the eyelid quickly but not too deeply until you extract it naturally through the skin.
Pull out the hair and insert it into the mixture, but let there be only one or two hairs at most.
Place your hand on it until the hair is removed from the eyelid and mix it with the solution naturally.
But if the mixture is not removed from the eyelid and the hair is not extracted, you should apply the mixture to the incisions around it, using the field that you have prepared with it, until the mixture is removed from above.
Watch it with your eyes, for you will remove the mixture and the field, and grind each of them thoroughly, and leave the ground up for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and grows over it well on good flesh.
If the hair is short, then you should adjust a long hair from natural hairs and lift it with that, or let it grow until it reaches an appropriate space, and then lift it.
Chapter XIII.
On the treatment for exorcising the condition called ehacratir in the eyelid.
When ehacratir appears in the eyelid and is a contraction of the eyelid when it contracts on either right or left side due to poor consolidation from plague, injury or cauterization, it is known as leporina, and it can be natural or accidental. It is caused by consolidation from plague, injury or cauterization, or something similar in nature, resulting in poor healing.
The procedure for the operation is to cut that consolidation and separate the lips of it, placing a piece of cloth there until they are healed and tied together.
It is also necessary to use healing methods for the causes that cause it, as returning ehacratir in a worse state than before will not have a favorable outcome.
Use in that case causes that soften it such as fenugreek, and wrap it with the water in which it is boiled, or dyeuquilon ointment, which is liquefied with oil, and immerse the cloth in it and heal it with it.
The secret of your healing is that you perforate everything carefully that was not previously consolidated in the manner described at the beginning.
This operation that we have mentioned is nothing but a correction of ehacratir that does not return the shape of the place as it was before.
Chapter XIV.
On the treatment for ehacratir that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This ehacratir that occurs in the lower eyelid, which is actually called ehacratir; and it can be either natural or accidental.
Accidental ehacratir is caused by plague or injury or cauterization, or something similar.
The method of operation for this is to take a needle with double thread and insert it into the flesh, making it pass from the left tear duct to the right tear duct until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the skin around it with the needle and sew it up with the needle, and incise it deeply with a large spoon. Therefore, if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, that is good; but if not, take the ray and place it in the fractured figure, and with that convert the eyelid, and make two slits in the lateral part of the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two slits be at two corners of the incision that meet and make a right angle where they converge, so that when they come together, the figure is formed.
And this shape is the Greek letter lambda (Œª).
Push the flesh aside to the extent of the length of the sharp blade from it, so that the eyelid is visible.
Push the parts apart and stitch them with thread, care for them with what we call softening medicines and warm baths until they are healed.
If the eye is to be closed by suture or cauterization, you must make a clean cut across the eyelid as instructed. Push apart the warmth between the lips as previously instructed.
In summary, in the sermon on the treatment of eye closure when it is above or below, you must perform the operation according to its preparation, and that is in the form of a diverse cluster.
The skillful artist always prepares the device in every possible way that is within his reach until he restores the figure to its natural form or close to it, and the patient according to what is necessary for the operation and the tools in the best arrangement.
Chapter XV.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or the cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in many men who are completely adhered to the eyelid above the tear duct and prevented from moving freely and performing its natural functions, you must intervene at the edge of the ray below the eyelid, raise it or stretch it with oil.
And you incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharp like a knife, since the patient is anxious about the operation. Remove the spatula without damaging the eye or its surrounding area.
Make your incision in such a way that the adhesion is removed with ease, allowing the eyelid to return to its natural form and healing the entire adhesion.
And you put saltwater in the eye to wash it, or distill it in a saucepan with water.
Separate the space between the eyelid and the eye with warm water, then place a woolen pad soaked in oil on the eye, and apply a third-day treatment of consolidating agents until it is healed.
Chapter XVI.
On incision of the nail and removal of skin from the eyelids.
Know that the nail can be in two ways: either it is nervous, resembling a hard, thin cipher; or it is non-nervous, resembling congealed white moisture, which when touched, or squeezed, it separates easily and the oil is not inserted into it.
And in both cases, they do not begin until the large tear duct is covered, gradually moving towards the vision and preventing light and eye movement.
However, the method of working in the incision is that the patient lowers their head towards yours and opens their eyes, you raise the eyelid with your hand, collect the nail with oil-soaked tweezers and stretch it to the edges above. And you take a needle and insert it into the root of a horse's or cow's or goat's hair, or something similar, or thick, double the tip of the needle little by little and insert it into the middle of the nail, penetrate it with the needle, and remove the nail; stretch it to the edges above, and cut off the root of the hair that is near the pupil. And you follow this by the hair towards the end of the procedure.
And you incise the root of the tear duct along its length with a fine spatula or small scissors, and cut away the natural tissue of the tear duct to prevent continuous flow of tears during the incision.
Sometimes the nail with only oil or fat is extended as previously mentioned, and it should be cauterized with lion's wool, which has this shape:
Be aware that the spatula should not touch the corneal membrane and should cause a break in it, and the pupil should be perforated.
Make the incision in the eye with a small amount of salt water or thyme oil, and let it heal by itself within a day; care for it with what is necessary until it is healed.
If the nail is not nervous and you cannot insert the needle or oil into it, let this type of nail be cured with medicines, and healed in this way as I have said and recommended in the division.
If you want to incise it, you open the eye of the patient and take a fine lion's wool spatula with sharp edges as follows: In thinness. If the moisture is thickened and congested in the cavity, you distill water from your boiling pot of thyme oil or rose oil or saltwater into the eye, and let it rest for a day.
And you repeat the operation until all that is present in it has disappeared, unless a counter-abscess appears in the eye, in which case you remove it, and care for the abscess until it is healed.
Approach your operation repeatedly until it heals.
The discharge of the lacrimal flesh, if noticed by a strong odor, should be suspended with oil; and cut that out from one side, and do not deepen the incision so as not to cause the flow of tears.
Then distill in the lacrimal eye root and apply sinapi seed until it heals.
Chapter XVII.
On the incision of anal abscess and that which is born of skin adhered to the anus.
In some cases, in the anus there is born red flesh, which is overgrown and covers the pupil or approaches and presses on the eyelids, strongly compressing them at the edges and resembling a rose of a balustrade.
However, the operation on it is that the patient holds his head; and open the anus, collect all that flesh with suitable scissors, and take it out with forceps or a cage; and begin to incise the flesh from the beginning until it is finished with scissors, and be careful not to damage the anus during your operation.
And your incision may be with which you incise that or with the spatula that we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small forceps according to the shape of it that comes close to this chapter.
Therefore, when your incision is complete and all the flesh has been removed, fill the anus with salt ash, or distill in it red powder resembling that of corrosive medicines, and place over the anus, covered with alum powder until it is assured of cauterizing the abscess.
And if there remains any cause of anal abscess and the cauterized wound is not healed, and you fear the cauterizing of the abscess, release the anus and treat that abscess with what will soften it, and then repeat the operation over it until it is healed, and similarly do in the skin adhered to the anus of this kind.
However, you must be careful to avoid all cure of the anus by natural means or accidental means, work with iron, and do not place your hand in any of these operations until you see that the member is sufficiently prepared for that operation.
Chapter XVIII.
On the collection of pus in the anus.
Pus is reddish-colored and hard on the anus and forbids the clothing its operation, and loosen the anus with warm water for days.
Therefore, at the beginning it is necessary that you consider if the anus in which there is pus is strong and if there is no other disease than pus, then collect the pus.
And you command the patient to hold his head on your lap, and suspend those veins with oil or two according to your discretion; and that oil should be of double refinement in this way:
or two oils gradually in one container according to this form:
Then those veins are collected with fine forceps, finely, and the blood is drained gradually until you see those veins be removed from the anus and swollen.
And be careful not to damage the anus at the ends of the spatula; and if your operation is in the middle of the day, be firm in your operation that you do not incise anything but those veins.
And when you have finished, then distill in the anus head green or red powder to burn what remains of the pus.
However, if that is not possible for you to collect everything at that time, then you fill it all with what relieves the pain of it, and release it for several days until the pain is subsided and the abscess is assured of cauterizing.
Then repeat on it according to what the matter requires until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter XIX.
On the reduction of arisatum to the nose.
When you cure arisatum with cautery or acute medicine burning as described earlier and it is not healed, do not be deceived in it but make a slit on the mature abscess, extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus until the bone appears.
And therefore, when the bone is visible and sometimes corruption or blackness is observed in it, you scrape it with an instrument that has this form:
It is called sharp head, and it should be made of iron, and its head should be round like a nail that is pierced through with a point of lime or alum powder (as shown in the following shape):
Place it on the corrupt part of the bone, and turn it between your fingers, pressing your small hand gradually until you know that the corruption is scraped off.
This should be done for some time, and then restore the area with drying and stiffening causes.
Therefore, if the area is consolidated and good flesh grows there and the body separates from the wound and remains for forty days without being renewed or drained and no accident occurs in the area, then you know it has healed.
And if it is not an abscess but rather a wound that needs to be reduced to the shape of the nose, and you do so using this method: first, you uncover it with a sharp instrument or medicine, once the bone is exposed, then you take three pieces of linen as follows:
Make the handle of the instrument triangular, and its shaft extended to the end in this way as sometimes done.
Then place the splint on the bone (the one that is near the tear duct), and hold it with a little of your thumb, and then bend your hand around the linen until it penetrates the entire bone, and the patient feels it when you press down on their hand.
Therefore, you restore the area with styptic medications drying as advised.
When the flesh and area harden, the material that comes out from the wound returns to the nose, thus it is less painful for the patient.
Chapter XX.
On the reduction of the swelling in the heel.
When the heel swells completely and no harm or decrease occurs, you must loosen the patient, support their head, and place compresses on the neck without incision and using good suction; then place liniment on the heel made of aloe, camphor, myrrh, and colocynth, and apply a strong plaster on the heel with much powder.
The method for preparing the powders is to take lions' wool in pieces, and each piece should be doubled four times; then grind them into powder.
Then place the required amount of powder on one over the other according to the size of the swelling that is needed. Then strengthen the powdered mixture with tough, strong material and tightly bound cloth; repeat the compresses without incision using good suction; leave the compresses on the swelling for the day and night.
But if during this time the ligament becomes soft, it must be made tighter.
Leave the ligament as previously described for the day and night.
If the swelling has already been reduced (that is good), but if not, then continue to apply the plaster with powders and tight binding and compresses until it is healed.
Chapter XXI.
On the incision of the protrusion of the tunica uvea (eye membrane).
When there is a disruption in the tunica uvea (eye membrane) and it protrudes out of the eyelid like a grain of sand, you should shape it like a human head for easier incision. If you wish to perform the operation, do so as follows: insert the needle into the white part of the eye at the lower side, and then place another needle with double thread from the tear duct side, making the two needles intersect; pull out the first needle according to its position; and then incise the site where the two needles meet and remove the protruding part of the eye membrane around the intersection of the needle. Strengthen this area.
Then remove the needle and place it on a woolen linen soaked in egg white, allowing the thread to pass through the yolk.
And care for the wound with whatever helps it heal until the injury is healed.
At certain times, surround the entire area with a circle of cloth around the swollen area and pierce it with a thin spatula at the center of the swelling, allowing the white substance to drain and reduce the swelling as quickly as possible.
Approach strong within so that it may heal.
Chapter XXII.
Chapter on treating hernias.
This disease called alconati is not simply water that descends but something else.
The method of working on it is to make the patient lie down straight on a bed with the affected side exposed, and then grab his head with both hands and push it toward the opposite side to make the water stay in place and not descend, keep the lumen open, and let the patient see the causes as he used to.
And if it does not descend, know that it is water.
But if the descent to health is not prepared with what has been said, then make the patient lie down on his back, take a thin spatula and place it on the navel, following the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea toward the crown (into the desired location), until the intestine is forgotten.
Then you distill in the hot water vapor the infusion that you have mixed with honey or water in which you have boiled fennel and honey.
And heal the other causes until it is cured.
Capital, Chapter XXII.
On the cure of descending water from the sweat.
I have already said about the types of water in division and which is suitable for piercing with the serum explaining it, then perform that according to health.
It is necessary that you make the patient lie down on his back on a bed and raise his feet slightly, tying them with a string.
And place your hand close to the eyelid of the patient's right eye if the water is on the right side, or with your left hand if it is on the left.
And take almonds with your right hand if it is on the left side, or with your left hand if it is on the right.
And place the end of the almond near the crown by the thickness of the nail in the albumen of the eye on the side of the lesser lacrimal, and grind the almond with virtue and roll it with your hand towards that side.
And pierce the eggwhite of the eye and feel that the almond has reached its goal due to the purpose.
It is necessary that the measure of the path of the almond to the prick be equal to the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the iris, and it is the crown of the eye; for you will see with the pupil the vision of the eye through the clarity of the cornea.
And place the almond into the location where the water is and then you thrust it down slightly towards another place, and if the water descends immediately, then quickly make the patient cover his eyes and put the almond in his eye.
Then rest for a short time; if the water descends, then you rest after that moment when the almond is not dropped.
And when it is dry and does not descend, then you extract the almond easily and grind it slightly with your hand, and dissolve a little clear salt in the water and wash the eye inside; and outside the eye, place or stop or wool infused in rose oil and egg white and bind it with water.
But we of our time do not practice that treatment with an egg white mixture.
If your almond is not hard enough to enter the eye due to its toughness (since there are some people whose eyes are very tough), then it is necessary that you take the spatula which is called alder, of which this is the shape:
Then pierce that conjunctiva, and do not damage your hand in the process, and do not force it to go via almond's location.
And introduce the almond as we said before.
You should complete the work, prepare a bed for the patient with a descending position in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room, and prohibit all movement.
Rest in the nature of that which we have said for his nature to remain steady, and do not turn his head to the right or left at all.
Let him eat as his condition permits for three days.
And release him in that dark place and open his eyes, show him some causes, and return the food to him on the seventh day.
You should not do this in the healing hour or soon after the infusion. It has been said that you must avoid doing it because water can easily pass due to great and violent looking.
If an abscess occurs, it is necessary that you release the eye after seven days and correct it with what dissolves the abscess.
You absorb the eye and rest on the patient's face so that it is regulated for a few days, existing in the most dark place.
And gradually reduce it from that darkness and convert it to its causes.
Know that in the school, a student is not excused from vision for several days, and if you are daring about the operation.
It has now come to us from one of those who is called Artax, and another said that he made a fire with alder wood pierced by water.
However, we have not seen it performed in our land by anyone who has perfected it, nor is it written about it in any of the ancient books; it is possible that this is new.
These are the shapes of the almond types, which are to be used on those who do not know them:
They are made of iron or steel properly, and their ends have this subtle, triangular shape, with an acute end as its form.
It seems like the text you've provided is from a medical treatise, possibly discussing various procedures related to surgery and medicine during medieval times. The lines I translated describe how gout (podagra) is identified, and the recommended treatment for foot pain caused by it. Additionally, the text mentions a procedure for reducing an intestinal hernia, as well as the preparation of a patient for surgery, including positioning and support from assistants. The line starting with "E sian faytas de eram o de ferr" seems to be referring to tools made of iron or steel that have a specific shape. It's fascinating to see how medical practices have evolved over time!
Do not cauterize the nose in the treatment of flesh.
When various kinds of flesh grow in the nose that resemble the sting of a scorpion or the feeler of a polyps, this disease is called "polyps," which is similar to the representation of such a polyp. From it comes cancerous flesh, leprous, dark colored; and from it is the flesh of a lion not dark-colored.
Therefore, in that which is not fraudulent or cancerous lion flesh, the patient must be made to sit exposed to the sun and have their nose opened, and make an incision where the flesh is found. Then extract that from the forehead part and incise what you have previously understood of it with a sharp, subtle spatula between the parts where you know all the flesh has been separated; for if any cause remains that requires abscission, then you remove it with one of the subtle instruments until there is no further need. However, if the abscess or boil becomes septic, you must wait for it to open; or if it is a malignant abscess, you cover and cauterize it until it is drained and all the cavities are left open.
Then apply some dressing near the incision in the nose, using vinegar or water. However, if the nose is open and humidity enters into the palate, you should know that it has healed.
However, if the humidity does not penetrate as it should, then you should know that inside it is flesh neither pus nor bone of the nose to which no abscission has been performed.
Therefore, you must enter the faithful person's mouth, and press against the molars, and pause between each tooth the amount of the finger or thumb, and gently examine the patient and insert one end of the file into the nose with either a rod or another means possible.
And after performing the action described above, you should draw its fragrance into it until it reaches the nasal canals and is excreted onto the patient's forehead, as children at school often do this action, and it is an easy cause for those who wish to do it.
Then pause the two ends of the file, one end protruding from the nose and the other remaining within the nose, and then apply a carving tool to the flesh on the teeth that are in the file, and do this until you know that the flesh is around the teeth of the file.
Then extract the file, and pause in the nose near the drainage of pus using a small cup or bowl, and do this for three days or more until the soreness subsides completely from the flesh.
And in the end of the procedure, pause a lead cannula in the nose for several days until it heals.
Uses it if the treatment dries up.
And this is the shape of the instrument for capping the purge maker, with which essential oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And make it of silver or copper, similar to a small lantern opened like a small jug, and the neck should be similar.
And if you wish, make a closed canal like a pipe, and the nozzle of the capping purge maker should be flat, open; on which you can hold it when you draw out oil or water that you want from the juices and secretions.
Chapter 25.
On the origins of teeth in the nasal cavities.
When a tooth emerges from the nasal cavity, it is magnified and extolled in some days until the tooth is loosened and falls out.
And since you should cut it off at the beginning of its appearance, dig it out completely. Place your hand over the area or use cauterization or burning medicine in that place.
If the tooth's excision is delayed until it becomes magnified, then consider if it is hard, dark in color, and has little sensation; do not touch it with iron as it is a cancerous abscess, for the tooth that excises this abscess carries great danger to that person.
If the abscess is soft and not dark in color, and excision is possible, then evacuate the patient and excise it without fear, heal the area with a drying agent and keep it until it heals.
Chapter 26.
On the suture of the nose, lips and ear when continuity is dissolved by ulceration or something similar.
Know that when the continuity is dissolved in one of these cartilages, little confidence should be placed in this operation except in certain men.
So when you treat any of these causes, consider if it is a fresh ulcer with its own blood, and then sew the two lips of the ulcer together with sutures, and place a dressing on it until it heals.
And if the lips of continuity dissolution are already separated and each is made healthy, you must cut each half of its chain as far as it bleeds. Place the two lips together with sutures and strengthen them, then sprinkle dragon's blood powder over it and triturate it, and place a dressing of emplaustra diafinicon or any other consolidating plasters on top of the powder, leave it for two or three days, then remove the dressing and replace it with another plaster until the flesh heals by itself, and care for it with mouthwash until it heals.
The method of suture is that you add the solution of continuity or with needles as recommended in abdominal sutures, or add the solution of continuity with thread as you know.
Chapter 27.
On the extraction of the causes that appear in both lips in the interior divisions.
When the tooth emerges in the interior divisions of men's lips, some cancerous abscesses similar to pus-like matter appear, and some are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore, you should turn the lips and wounds of each abscess completely, fill the area with sagittarius powder until the blood is stopped, and wash it with vinegar and heal the area with astringent water until it heals.
Chapter 28.
On the excision of the attached flesh in the gums.
A growth often occurs on the attached flesh of the gums, which the ancients called albulus; therefore, you should suspend it with a thread or hold it with forceps and excise it as necessary, and allow the blood to flow or let it drain.
And place a dressing of sage powder or other astringent or healing powders on top.
And if the flesh returns, you must excise it again and cauterize it, for the cautery will not return.
Chapter 29.
On the extraction of teeth with iron.
When sharp scars appear on the surface of the teeth in the interior divisions, in the roots and between the gums, some are often darkened and become cavity or green until the gum is affected by this corruption and the teeth become loose.
Therefore it is necessary for you to seize the patient between your hands and hold their head in your lap, pull out the teeth where the abscesses or causes similar to sand appear before any cause remains, and do this with the black and citrus-like substances (perhaps referring to some medicinal materials) until they are purified.
If it is at the beginning of the reasoning, that's fine; otherwise, you must repeat the reasoning on other days and on the third day until it reaches the final statement that you desire.
You should know that teeth have a need for various kinds of resorbers with different shapes and forms according to how it is prepared for your operation. And so because the resorber used for removing the tooth from its socket is different from the one used to scrape between the teeth, these types of resorbers must be prepared which you will soon see:
Capital thirty.
De eradicaci√≥n de dientes.
It is necessary that you treat the tooth of its pain with all care and to take all precautions during the entire extraction process, because it is not a good thing for the remaining portion of the tooth to be exposed when it is extracted, as it contains sublime substance which is an exception in the extraction process.
However, when the patient needs to have that tooth extracted, you must be certain which tooth is causing the pain because many times the pain deceives the patient and makes them think it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract the wrong one and the pain does not stop until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted, as we have seen through barber surgery.
Therefore, since you must be certain which tooth is causing the pain and know it well, you should make an incision around the tooth with spittle containing some virtue, until it is dissolved from the tooth and gum in its entirety, and then apply mau or fine forceps gradually until it is fully loosened.
And apply some ointment with strong holding forceps for good communication or structure, and hold the patient's head between your thick hands so that you have a good grip on it without causing discomfort, and carefully move the tooth in a manner that does not break it or cause the patient more pain.
And so if it is not forgotten, then you should take one of those instruments, and place it in the area with ease and effort for the removal of it as described at the beginning.
However, if the tooth is fractured or corroded, you must cover that fracture with cloth and compress it at the end of a thin rod to avoid cracking it during your compression with forceps.
And you must work carefully and make incisions in the entire circumference of the gum and use caution so as not to break it or leave a gaping hole in it, and then return over the patient to check if the pain is greater than the original pain of it.
Be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their practice and arrogance during tooth extraction, because they don't administer the remedies that we have recommended; for many times they cause great swellings on men's faces which are difficult to treat, and all or some of the roots remain, or some bones of the jaw remain as we have seen testified by many cases.
And the removal of it should be washed with water or vinegar with salt.
And if blood flow occurs through here, for example like a watched motion (I'm assuming you meant "observed motion", such as pulsation), then take some amount of vinegar and sprinkle it over the affected area, and if that does not stop the bleeding, cauterize.
The form of the forceps and tweezers that are used at the beginning should be long in length, short in width and thick, to avoid being bent when they are used.
And should be as broad in the handle as necessary so that when it is tightened they are not bent, and be short in length.
They should be made of Indian iron and straight in length, and on the ends of those there should be teeth that interlock with each other and tighten firmly by pressure from the sides, and sometimes the ends of those are shaped like a stork's beak (ciconia), which is called "guanta", and they have strong grip.
Capital XXXI. This is the number indicating which chapter or section of the text this passage belongs to in the treatise. It is important for organizing and reference purposes.
On the removal of teeth and extraction of broken bones from the jaws. This passage likely discusses a surgical procedure for treating injuries or diseases affecting the jaw, such as impacted teeth or fractured bones.
When the removal of a broken tooth is necessary due to some cause, then you must stop on that spot and wait for one or two days until it becomes softened; and then insert forceps or tweezers with tips shaped like a stork's beak (ciconia) or "guanta", the type of forceps mentioned earlier:
The tips of these forceps should be made hollow like a file or an awl. This suggests that the hollow tips of the forceps can be used to scoop out pus or other debris from an abscess, or possibly drill small holes in bone during surgery.
If you do not follow the instructions regarding these forceps or tweezers, then you must be cautious and carefully cut away all the tissue and insert an instrument called an "atali", which is a small lever with the following shape:
It should have a short, thick handle, and not be bent so that it is not broken. This indicates that the atali lever should have a sturdy construction to withstand the force required during surgical procedures. A bent or broken lever could cause complications and make the surgery more difficult.
If the incision is forgotten, it is good; otherwise, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are their shapes: The shape of the first instrument is that of a triangle with some thickness:
The second instrument is shaped like a triangle with a thin point:
You are now assisted by this instrument, which has two arms shaped as follows: and with other instruments that I will describe for tooth extraction; because this instrument is also used, which resembles a large nail, and its shape is as follows:
of the curved or short triangular tip with some thickness, and not be bent so that it is not broken.
And you should know that the instruments for extracting teeth are similar to the other instruments mentioned. This suggests that the tools used for tooth extraction may be similar in design or function to the other surgical instruments described in this text, such as forceps and levers. The specifics of each tool and its intended use may vary depending on the nature of the procedure being performed.
But the skillful and subtle artisan should understand for himself what this means regarding the operation and various diseases; because there are diseases about which the ancients did not know or use specific instruments, due to their diverse forms in different species. This indicates that the practice of medicine has evolved over time, and that new tools and techniques have been developed to address a wider range of health issues.
But if the jawbone or other bones in the mouth are broken, or if there is a fracture, then apply a cast to that area with what is appropriate for it regarding instruments and forceps as we have discussed in the removal of teeth incision, and assist yourself with this gesture whose shape is:
It should be gradually widened, and held in place within the mouth so that it does not escape or fall out before the bone is completely healed; then restore the area with appropriate medications. This passage appears to describe the process of applying a cast to a broken jaw or other bones in the mouth. The cast must be carefully widened over time to allow for proper healing, and should be held securely in place within the mouth to prevent it from shifting or falling out. Additionally, the area should be treated with appropriate medications to promote healing and prevent infection.
If there is a small purulence in the bone, then remove that from the purulence and its blackness, and heal it within until it is healed.

When teeth are protruding not according to their natural shape, the form is illegal, and more so in women and especially in venerable virgins; therefore you must consider: if a tooth is adjacent to another tooth, and it cannot be sutured or treated with liniment, then uproot that tooth; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then cut it out with this instrument of which the shape is as follows: similar to a pig's snout, made from sharp Indian steel.
Then make your incision with the instrument you will use to cut out the tooth in several days according to the hardness of the tooth, and ensure it does not harm any other teeth.
And if the protruding tooth is swollen due to grinding, then grind it down with an Indian steel file of this shape:
The file and marguerite should both be made of Indian steel; they should have many small points like a lima used to make needles, with which the tooth will be ground down little by little in several days for ease, so that no other tooth is harmed and it does not fall out. Then bring the end of the file to the tip, and remove the end with another razor.
If a tooth is broken and pierces the tongue, you must grind it down until the sharp edge of that fragment is removed and sealed, and it should be filled to prevent the tongue from being injured or the speech from being distorted.
Here is the next line to translate:
Here is the next line to translate:
When teeth are knocked out due to a blow or hunting and the patient is unable to bite down on anything to eat, and you have treated it with stiffening medications but your treatment has not worked, then, so that they do not rot, strengthen them with gold wire, not silver, for silver becomes soft and can be dissolved in a few days, while gold does not change.
The wire should be of such subtlety and thickness suitable for the space between the teeth; and the shape of the binding is that you take the wire and take double its length between two healthy teeth, and grow the twists in the wire between the damaged teeth, or one or several of them, until it reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. Place the dressing over the damaged area and strengthen your hand with ease and wisdom until it is healed.
Your binding should tighten the wire of the teeth so that they do not loosen.
Then cut off the excess wire with forceps or pliers and add it in each place as needed, and bend them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue. And seal it tightly with wax like a Roman.
But if it is loosened or broken, strengthen it or them in this manner at all times.
Here is the form and figure of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, sometimes intertwined as follows:
And when one tooth or two return to their natural position after being knocked out and grow back as recommended and remain healthy.
And this is not done by inexperienced or unskilled people.
In some cases, a cow's bone is used as a tooth replacement, shaped like a tooth and placed in the location where the tooth is missing, tightened as previously mentioned, and remains serving for a long time.
Here is the next line to translate:
Cut the ligament that appears on the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament that appears on the tongue sometimes naturally or which one has, or it is accidental and happens due to a wound that has already consolidated.
The operation is to open the mouth of the patient and hold his head with yours; lift his tongue and incise the ligament nerve as far back as necessary until the tongue is free from its recent growth.
But if there is any hardness or toughness, and it is fixed by the consolidation of a wound, then you throw oil and cut through it as far back as you have incised the ligament and the toughness has been removed.
And be careful not to make a gap in the skin during the incision and that you cut through the arch only and let blood flow out.
Then wash the wound with water or vinegar or warm water; and place a clean linen cloth on it, this is what will keep the patient from having to put his tongue in his mouth every night until it has not consolidated again.
But if there is bleeding, place a wet piece of vinegar on it; but if the blood stops, then cauterize the area with a light cautery, which is suitable for that. And apply this treatment for other causes until it has been healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula from the tongue.
Sometimes a small ranula appears on the tongue, resembling a small pimple, preventing its normal operation; and it grows considerably inside the mouth.
The operation is to open the mouth of the patient in front of you, and examine the ranula.
And if you see a dark or black, hard, and insensitive lump that the patient does not feel, do not touch it for fear of cancer.
And if it turns white with moisture, in which there is humidity, then you put oil on it and incise it with a thin spatula from all sides; and if blood comes out during your operation, then you place wet vinegar on it until the bleeding stops.
And return to your work until you have treated it completely, until it is washed with vinegar and salt; and treat it with the other treatment for it until it has been healed.
Chapter 36.
On the extraction of an ear abscess and that which is nothing in the ear canal, and other abscesses.
When pus accumulates in the ear canal, it is glands similar to pus, which appear outside and are called double ears, which when you treat with what has been said in the previous division and it does not heal, then you consider whether the abscess is hard, dark-colored, insensitive, then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red-colored and the root is thick, do not touch it with iron due to bleeding; let it mature, and then either you remove it or it breaks by itself.
And if it is white-colored, rounded and the root is thin, it should be incised.
And the operation is to consider whether the abscess has rested after being cauterized with complete rest or whether it has decreased with some decrease; and then you prepare the patient in front of you, his head on your lap, open his mouth, and a servant holds his tongue away from him with a noble instrument, which has this form:
And it is made of silver or iron, and it is thin like a scalpel.
So when you press the tongue and show the abscess to you, put oil on it and place it in the instrument, and pull it out from all sides as much as possible. Or when you pull for some reason of the layers, then incise it with an instrument that has this form:
Or when you pull for some reason of the layers, then incise it with an instrument that has this form: and is similar to forceps, but the extensions of it are curved, so that the orifice of each one is opposite to the other, very sharp, which should be made of iron, but covered with silver.
If this instrument is not available to you, then make an incision with the sharp end of it, not the blunt end.
And after making an incision, make the second one according to this method of incision, and ensure that the patient protects it from cold water.
If there is bleeding, protect it with a decoction of blackthorn or myrtle leaf and similar to those used for cauterization until the bleeding stops, and care for it until it heals.
And sometimes we treat other abscesses or those two ear abscesses by incising them as I have said about the incision of two wounds together.
I treated a woman with an abscess that was located in her ear, which had a dark color, little sensitivity, and had closed the ear canal of its own accord. The woman was breathing with difficulty and had been prohibited from eating and drinking water for some time, and she would have died within a day or two if it hadn't stopped.
The abscess had grown so much that it burst after about two days through two holes.
Therefore, I will make an incision and insert it into one of the ear canals, pull it out along with the large part, then incise the other hole where I will find the other end, and hold the opening of it, compress the tongue, and insert the ear canal into the abscess.
And I will cut out a large piece of it, and there is only a little bleeding. So the woman's ear canal is completely healed, and she should start drinking water immediately, and ensure proper nutrition, so I will not continue to incise the abscess for a long time, and an abscess will form in its place, which I will incise when it has grown.
Therefore, I will burn and cauterize the woman's ear canal, so that it heals faster; and I will walk around and not know what God has in store for me about this.
Chapter XXXVII.
On incision of an abscess in the liver.
When the liver is affected by catarrh and it becomes an abscess that is long, it is called vertical; and if it is in the lower thick and round part, it is called a cyst.
But when it is cured with what has been said in the division, and it does not respond to your treatment, and there are sometimes abscesses that have already healed and are subtle, you must incise the round one; and if it is long and bleeding, of dark or black color, and not sensitive, you must be careful with the incision, for there is fear for the patient.
And when you see one that follows the method I have mentioned with its whiteness and length, you should squeeze the patient's hand and press their tongue against an instrument shaped like it, and insert the ear canal into the new one, pull it down and incise it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the incision of two wounds.
You must not incise it unless it is located at the natural boundary without addition, for if you incise more than that, you will damage his speech.
And during the incision, use what we have recommended in the incision of two wounds, and care for it until it heals.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, you must use an instrument for cauterization without fear, and the method of cauterization in it is not with anything other than sharp water. Place your hand on the patient's head and press their tongue against the instrument I have mentioned, and take a small amount of the water we have described in the section on cauterization, and apply it to the live part without pressing too hard or too gently, and fill the concavity of the instrument with that.
The extramarginal part of the concavity in which the medicine has been placed should be like the concavity of a spoon, and the instrument with the medicine should be placed on the uvula. Let the patient drink water through his nose so that saliva or mucus from his mouth flows into the intrinsic medicine, to prevent any of those causes from affecting the ear canal and softening it.
And place your hand with the medicine on it and press it against the uvula for about an hour until you see it darken and become numb from the bitterness of the medicine.
If you want, take a cotton ball and wrap it around the end of the ray, dip the cotton in the medicine, insert the ray with the cotton into a tube so that the cotton adheres to the tube, and do this as many times as needed for the desired result from the cauterization of the uvula, and let it dry and fall off in about three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, do so, and avoid the cauterization around the uvula with a damp cotton pad, clean it with what is in the circuit of the medicine, let it be washed with cold water, healed outside with embrocation, and protected inside until it heals.
This species of cure is preserved by being cautiously incised and kept long.
Some throats are cured with what is called subtile cautery and incision, for it is cured by the method of subfumigation: take gently, ysop, origan, ruda, scicados arabic, camomilla, bruyere and similar herbs, and place all these herbs, or some of them, in a bowl, and immerse them in vinegar and boil; let the bowl be well beaten with a spoon, and let there be a hole, on which an instrument shall be placed to prevent it from spilling out. Let it be made of silver or iron.
Let the tip of the instrument enter into the mouth of the patient up to the area where the steam can reach the uvula over which the uvula is masked.
Then return to the places of those throats that are dry, and be careful not to perform this cure at the beginning of abscess development, for it would aggravate the abscess, and it is not necessary to do so, but rather you should make the declaration of abscess with caution.
But if this instrument is not present at hand, then take a cane and make a hole in the end of it filled with honey, so that the patient's mouth is closed, for the plug of honey prevents the steam from burning the patient's mouth.
This cure is good for health.
Capital XXXVIII.
Of the extraction of thorns and what sticks in the throat, and of other causes.
Throats sticking to the throat or a splinter from the feet or some other cause.
Therefore, you must extract what is visible from those things, over which the eye falls, since you press the tongue with an instrument in front of it, so that what is in the throat is made clear to you.
And what is not apparent and is concealed in the throat, it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, since the cause adhered to the throat will be forgotten by vomiting; or make the patient swallow a piece of bread or raisin or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of sea sponge, squeeze it strongly and forcefully, and make the patient swallow it, since when it reaches the place where the thorns are located, they will be forgotten. But take an eel and boil it in water, then strain it and extract it with a spoon; or take a pot and put it on the fire and when it boils, pour it out and drink it.
But if those causes mentioned above are not forgotten, then use an instrument of lead in the following way:
Let it be thick as a reed but narrow in the end, and there should be a concavity in the end that you can insert into the patient's throat with ease.
The patient should raise his head upwards and be careful not to touch the back of his skull with his throat, since this may cause damage to the neck or splinter the bone or the thorn, or the doctor may do so with his hand.
But if the patient enters into this more easily, it is better because of his knowledge of the location of the adhered cause and he presses downwards and pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all according to the amount that was prepared beforehand so that it is forgotten.
Capital XXXIX.
Of the extraction of blood clot adhered to the throat.
When the blood clot is treated with what was mentioned in the division of cure with medicines and does not improve, consider then in the throat of the patient at the sole, since you have already anesthetized the tongue of him with the instrument that you have recommended.
Therefore, if you see an abscess, extract it gently and carefully with a small or pointed instrument.
If it is not possible to extract the abscess, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the wound of the patient, place your hand in the concavity of the cannula with a hot iron, do this as many times (until the abscess is dead and removed from the wound) and keep the patient away from water for the entire day.
Then take a small water-filled bladder, open its mouth in that place, and rinse the opening with that; do not let any cause pass through it and allow the water to stay for an hour at a time, as the abscess will soon notice the water.
But if it is not forgotten what has been recommended, then fumigate the patient with cinnamon or asafoetida using the tool recommended for fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it falls (the abscess).
Another method of operation in fumigation is that you take an oil in which charcoal is ignited and the oil is covered with a lid on one side of which there is a hole, and the end of the tool should be inserted into this hole; and stop the patient's mouth over the opening of the cannula and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not forgotten until you know that the fumigation has reached the abscess, as the abscess will soon fall.
If it does not fall, you should repeat the fumigation several times and keep the patient from drinking, eating salted and alkaline foods, and not drinking water; and it is necessary that this regimen be forgotten.
And this is the shape of the tool used to treat abscesses in wounds when seen, and it resembles a pair of forceps like those sometimes, but with some curvature: The handle should be placed in the wound, and the end of it is shaped like the beak of a stork, which is hollow, sharpened with a file, so that when any cause is compressed, it does not release.
Chapter XL.
This is the summary of the sermon on the topic of abscesses and their treatment.
Abscesses are various species, of multiple types, as remembered from them in this book.
And they are different in their penetration and excision of them by two methods, one of which is for abscesses that grow within themselves; and because of the humidity.
The second method is for locations where accidents of the body occur, as an abscess that occurs in the head is different from one that occurs in the anus; and an abscess in a fleshly location is different from one at a joint. And each of these has its own treatment through operation.
However, some abscesses should not be perforated except for the maturation of the pus or completion of their course.
Other abscesses that should be drained when they are hard, and not allowed to mature according to their course, include those near joints, as an abscess near a joint will continue to grow until the surrounding tissue is purged or the nerves of that joint are corrupted, which can cause contraction of the affected limb; or an abscess in a main organ, and if you delay the draining of it for too long, it can spread to the main organ; or one in the anus, therefore drain it before it matures; and it is not necessary to drain a hard abscess from the digestive tract, but rather the one that is in the anus, as it may cause prolonged pain if left untreated and could lead to a fistula or abscess near the anus that does not heal. You must know the time of the abscess's perforation, and that is when it has matured.
When the pain subsides and the fever ceases, when there is a reduction in swelling and pulse, when the abscess's head becomes more acute and other symptoms appear, then it is time for incision.
And know that the perforation should be made at a spot below the abscess, and from where pus is coming out for treatment of the prominence.
The perforation should be made along the flesh or body if abscesses are in the groin or feet and at the joints of the limbs, cords of nerves, arteries; and finally, in all places where there is no reflection; because in those that are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
When the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better to wait for confirmation of its digestion before perforating, as we have said; because if you perforate too soon, you prolong the course of the pus and move it, and harden the edges and deepen the cavity.
Some abscesses should be perforated according to the thickness of the flesh or body as needed, or according to what that member requires.
You must make a small perforation in small abscesses and a large and wide or multiple incisions according to the size of the abscess.
Some abscesses that require the cavity to be concave and incised are done in such a way that they appear like bread and butter or when they are ripe, as in cases of tumors and buboes.
Of those that are incised and have three corners; and of these is the one that is incised like a myrtle leaf figure, as in the abscesses of gout.
And of those that are given round and crescent-shaped incisions, similar to these.
But in the case of superficial abscesses that do not have a specific form, you should perforate it with a surface or flat perforation only.
When the abscess is large and has collected pus, you must perforate it but do not rush to extract all the pus at that time; after extracting part of it, leave the abscess inside for another day, and then extract a larger part, and perform multiple observances according to gradation until it is forgotten.
Furthermore, if the patient is old, weak or a woman in labor, or a young child, then the animal spirit can be resolved with the exit of pus, and the patient may die as a result, so you should be careful with them.
Be very careful with this chapter and your perforation of these abscesses, as you must avoid wounds and consider whether the abscess wound is small or a flat incision; in such cases, administer one or two antiseptics; but if the abscess is large and the incisions are many, then you must wait for each to heal before proceeding.
And if in the abscess part of the cavity is removed or you have concaved it around its circumference, then you must seal it with old cote or thread made from cloth, like when you dress wounds or bandages, without moisture; and let it heal for three days; and process and cure it with the same care as for wounds until it heals.
But if bleeding occurs during the operation, administer cold water and wine diluted in linen cloth, and let it rest on the site of the bleeding for a while.
But if the bleeding persists, you must administer treatment and cure and powder as I have recommended in various places of this book and elsewhere.
If it is winter and the location of the abscess is near nerves, then you must apply powder in wine and warm oil and let it rest on those areas.
If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, then you must let the powder sit in water and oil or wine and oil, and let it rest until the third day as we have said, and then remove the abscess and clean it and administer to its cure whatever is appropriate for it until it heals.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses in general, but according to the different methods of treatment that I have previously described for each type of abscess in specific chapters.
Chapter 41.
On incision of abscesses that come in the cavity of the head.
Small abscesses and special types of swellings in the head cavity, which contain membranes that are formed from them; and their types are many.
Some have blisters, and others contain moisture resembling lime. And of those are the ones that contain moisture similar to powder, and resembling them; and of those are the ones that are stone-like, hard.
And in this section, and in the extraction of those, there should be no fear, as the extraction of them does not harm the archery.
The operation in this section of those is that you probe them with an instrument having the shape appropriate for this purpose, which is called an entromes, until you know what it contains.
If it contains moisture, then cut it with a section following its length using a shallow surface section in this manner:
Begin the incision at line B and continue to line G. Once the moisture is drained, scrape that area where the moisture was located, but do not leave any cause for it to return, as observed excesses often recur if there is still a cause remaining.
Then immerse the wound in warm Egyptian clay if it is available, or in water and salt; fill that with the wound and leave it to soak for another day, as the warm solution will dissolve everything that has been broken through the skin layer.
Then apply warm Egyptian clay to the wound twice a day if necessary, until you are confident that there is no remaining cause for the skin layer to be broken; once the wound has healed, care for it with warm water.
If an abscess contains fatty nodules, then make an incision in it using this shape: In this section, make an incision in the shape of a cross, and cut along both sides of the incision and remove it completely from all sides, and use your strength to extract the membrane containing it.
However, if it damages your bow (arm), then do what I told you first.
Similarly, perform surgery and treatment on the abscess as you have told me; and incision on an abscess is easy because it has little blood and little moisture.
Certainly, some abscesses are hard in some men whose heads have no moisture at all; the cause is because you incise an abscess on a woman's old head as if it were hard stone, rough, white, which could not be crushed, and if anyone struck it with percussion, it would hurt him.
But in other abscesses that occur in the head, this is not applicable, such as abscesses that come to the heads of children and you should remove the earlobes, but the incision of these ones shall be a superficial incision.
And stop the perforation of those in the lower part of their body to relieve the pain at the lower parts.
Then treat them with what is appropriate for their treatment.
Chapter 42.
On the incision of scrofulas which occur in the neck.
Frequently examine these abscesses in the neck and shoulders and in other places; and some occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck and those that are generated between them, and all scrofula of these is known as its own skin, and just as in knots and abscesses of the head, as we have recommended.
The species of these scrofulas are nodules, for some of them are hard, and those containing moisture are soft, and the malignant ones that do not respond to treatment.
Therefore, in the one that you see with good disposition in the Examination, of which the color of what is evident is similar to that of a quince seed, and it is bad all over, and not attached to the neck nerve, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and not pointed, so you should incise it with a superficial incision above the body line of G to the body line of B, and remove it completely from every side, and extend two lips of the quince seed or one quince seed lip if you have a need for them, as we have said in abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is more careful not to incise the vein or nerve.
Let the spatula not be too sharp, that it does not adjust to your hand or disturb the patient, and let you incise what is necessary to incise; for if you incise vein or artery and prohibit your action, then stop the wound with quicklime plaster or other powders which cause bleeding, and dress the wound, and leave it until it recovers from the abscess, and let the wound become softened and change into pus. When the blood is drained.
Therefore, return to your action until you have completed it.
And ask your assistant whether there is any other cause of the small scrofulas, so you can incise them and clean them.
If it is in the excision of a large scrofula vein, so you should not incise that scrofula from its excision. Afterwards, you must press it firmly with a fold and let it fall into itself without damage.
And fill the wound with old lint that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment and treat it.
If you incise the entire scrofula, then you must adjust the two lips of the wound and close it as soon as there is no further excess.
However, if you see that there is excess due to the size of the scrofula, then understand to excise its opening, remove it and provide suture and what has been said.
The soft scrofulas containing moisture, perforate it with a superficial perforation at the place of maturation of them, and stop the perforation of what is the base pus of the body, as we have said.
Provide perforation, lime water and similar, to corrode what is rotten from the corruption. And when you see the wound already cleaned, then treat it with general flesh ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
On the incision of the pilon in the abscess that occurs at the groin.
The ancients performed this incision on the pilon, and I have not seen anyone in our land perform it.
This is the inscription of their sermon.
However, in men having hernia, it should be avoided the extraction of the pilon, because all veins and major ones of the patient are there.
However, in those who have cauterized abscesses in the mouth or groin or both earlobes, when the illness is not in the canal, it is necessary to avoid the incision of the pilon to avoid the danger that is caused by perforation.
Therefore, when we wish to make an incision on the epiglottis, we should cut it into three circles of the epiglottis' circles, or four with a small section along its length where there are two circles in quantity, but the section should be in cartilage, not bone, and this location is suitable for the incision, as it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels of it are close.
If the doctor is inexperienced, then you should extend the neck of the goiter and make an incision on the neck up to where it reaches the throat, but avoid cutting any blood vessels if possible.
Then make an incision in the cervix as recommended, and it is intended on the section of the throat where the tumor is located that has been broken and due to the abscess of the vocal cords.
Leave the wound open for some time.
When the time comes when perforation is feared, apply two layers of gauze to the wound, but only on the cartilage.
Then administer medications that make the flesh heal within.
Therefore, Albusas tells us that the summary of the sermon that we have recommended is nothing more than a vein from which some of those boils have already drained the goiter of the patient, and the patient has come to death, and his body is cut open, and some will make an incision in the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe through the wound due to some respiration, and be saved from death.
Therefore, we command that the wound be left open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and this takes three days, and then you should close the wound and cure it until it is healed.
What I have seen myself, is that a servant struck him with a knife in the neck and made an incision in one part of his windpipe, and I was called to cure him, and I found the woman in such a state as if she were dead, and I uncovered the wound and found blood that had been drained from the small wound.
Therefore, you were confessed that she had not cut a vein or trachea, and the wound bled, and you cured it until it was healed.
And the servant did not harm her if there was not an abscess in the vocal cords, and after some days return to improvement of her condition.
Now tell me that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
Chapter 44.
On a section on an abscess that occurs outside the neck, which is called goiter hernia.
This goiter hernia abscess is a large abscess according to the color of the body and it is a disease in women.
And it can be of two types, either natural or accidental.
In the case of a natural goiter hernia, there is no need for treatment.
And the accidental type has two forms, one of which is similar to fatty nodes, and the other form is similar to an abscess that is made by the compression of an artery, and in this case there is fear. It is not necessary to make a presumption of him unless it is small. You should examine him and investigate him with the said method, and if you find it similar to fatty nodes that are not suspended in any of the veins, then you should remove it as you would remove nodes, extracting it along with its root and bursa; but if it is not, you should investigate his entire being, and treat the area with whatever is needed for treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Of incision of lymph node areas.
Of the swellings of the lymph nodes. And I have already said all their types in the division.
And it is necessary to distinguish between a node and an abscess when there is doubt.
So you say that an abscess is characterized by heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the excess matter subsides; it is putrid decay which now stops the fever, the pain, and the heat.
But a node is not characterized by heat, fever, or pain; it contains that hard mass which is in the sack itself.
And depending on the color of the body, it begins like a cyst and is made like a bladder, either large or small, and there are two types: either fatty with moisture, and the colors of moisture are swollen, as I said in the division.
Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a node, extract it and investigate it at its beginning, where there is a stone which is called intromis, as will appear in the chapter that is appropriate for this purpose.
This is the method of investigation of boils and all nodes, that is: you take this stone and introduce it into the location that is most moist in the abscess, and you rotate your thumb with it little by little until you know that the stone has penetrated the cyst.
And finally, place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and extract the intromis and consider what comes out as evidence of it.
If the running moisture (pus) is forgotten of whatever color it may be, then you incise it with a superficial cut, as I have said in other abscesses.
And if there is no pus found from the intromis, you know that it is fatty (granuloma).
Dry it over it with a lancet in this cross shape: As you have been taught, hang it up with a hook, and incise the cyst from all sides with ease, and preserve the skin or bag, if possible, over it and extract the purulent matter along with the node.
But if it is broken during the operation, it is not possible to extract the healthy part, and you will find that it has become putrid, and then you extract it in pieces until there remains no cause for concern.
For if there remains any cause (pus or inflammation), either a little or too much, the node should be returned as soon as possible.
If you see that a small part remains, you complete the wound with some sharp and strong corrosive powders and let it heal, and place caution over the abscess that was treated, and treat the other one with another cure until it is healed.
If the node is large, you cut the two lips of it and care for it as described in its nature (surgical removal).
But if there is pulsatile vein on the opposite side, or no pulsatile vein, you close and fill the wound with lime (calcium carbonate) and let it dry for two to three days until the wound heals and stops the bleeding from the wound; then return to incise what has grown from the node.
Chapter 46.
On the types of stones necessary in incision and perforation.
Of those are the forms of intromis (stones), and there are three types: one is large, another is middling, and the other is small.
The form of a large intromis is as follows:
The form of a small intromis is as follows:
They should be made of iron, aluminum, copper or brass tips, well-fashioned so that they pierce the intromis in abscesses.
These are the forms of experienced individuals (surgeons), and they are called scalpels, and one of them is called a lancet.
There are three types, namely large, medium, and small.
The form of the large experienced individual (surgeon) is as follows:
The form of the medium-sized experienced individual (surgeon) is as follows:
The form of the small experienced individual (surgeon) is as follows:
It seems to be a recommendation that these conditions - abscesses, ulcers, fistulas, buboes (boils) - are caused by bones or other reasons.
It is suggested that they be treated with large needles or leeches, which are sewn through the skin using thick threads made of iron, silver, or silver, and the best treatment is with leeches made of lemon juice.
They are to be treated with black plums, for which the experienced ones recommend opening the cavities of the fistulas and then reflecting the contents back into them.
And it is of three types, for some are long, others medium-sized, and others short, according to the size of the fistula and the narrowness of it.
Make a large lead plug:
Make a medium-sized lead plug:
Make a small lead plug:
The shapes of the onions are of several types, for some are simple with a single curve, and there are three types: large, few, and medium-sized.
And they are to be chopped or pureed, and they are of three types.
And among them are onions with two curves, and they are of three types.
And among them are onions with three curves, and they are of three types.
And all of these are necessary in their place.
Simple Ointment Formula (one-eighth):
Formula for a large ounce with two curves: Formula for a half ounce with two curves: Formula for a quarter ounce with two curves:
Formula for a large ounce with three curves:
Formula for a half ounce with three curves:
And these are the forms of scalpels with which they are cut and scraped the nodes and abscesses, and there are three types, as one is large, another half, and the third small.
Formula for a large scalpel:
Formula for a half-sized scalpel:
Formula for a small scalpel:
The external edges of those (scalpel blades) that are cut are sharp and the other external edges are not sharp, and they should not be used in this manner, but rather used to aid in the scraping of nodes with the concern of incision of vein or nerve, and for those it heals the patient and brings a little peace through the cauterization which brings peace to the abscess.
And these are the forms of alum, and there are three types: large, half, and small, as you can see.
They are made of herbs and resemble a king's balm, which is used to alleviate [pain/illness].
And it is in the external side with small holes and hidden with sponge, and then to move towards the vaginal area, either inside or outside, whenever you wish, just like when urinating.
The forms of sponges, which are hidden between the teeth, should be used for the perforation of abscesses without the patient feeling it, and there are three types: large, midwife, and small. And these are the forms of: [This line does not contain a complete statement or question in the given text. The following lines would typically provide more context for a complete translation. However, I can guess that it might be referring to "these are the forms of sponges" based on the context of medical procedures mentioned earlier.]
The forms of bloodletting lancets, which are used to extract the flow of blood, and there are three types: large, midwife, and small. The forms of these: [This line does not contain a complete statement or question in the given text. The following lines would typically provide more context for a complete translation. However, I can guess that it might be referring to "these are the forms of bloodletting lancets" based on the context of medical procedures mentioned earlier.]
They are made of citrus fruit, round with some length, and thin.
And you should have these types of bloodletting lancets: large, midwife, and small, for the purpose of quickly extracting bloodflow when necessary, and you should not use them in the initial stages without medication.
However, do not use these to extract blood in any part of the body, and only in areas with flesh such as the armpits, thighs, arms, breasts, abdomen, groin, and similar areas with fleshly folds.
And some veins are made of these small instruments resembling fish scalpels according to this form; through which blood is extracted when performed by phlebotomy, or for the incision of a vein or an artery.
And some veins are made round according to this form: [This line does not contain a complete statement or question in the given text. The following lines would typically provide more context for a complete translation. However, I can guess that it might be referring to "and some veins are made round" based on the context of medical instruments mentioned earlier.]
Chapter .xlvii. [This line appears to be the title or chapter number for a section in the treatise, but it is not in the original language and may have been added by a later editor or translator.]
On the treatment of male breasts which are similar to female ones. [This line provides context for the previous lines about veins, and it appears that the text is discussing medical procedures for treating conditions in men that resemble those found in women.]
Some veins in men's breasts become swollen during sleep like scabs, and the breasts become swollen, resembling those of women, and they develop abscesses, which should be drained, cauterized, and kept clean.
And for the one who has this condition, it is necessary to incise it with a lunar section according to this form from line B to line G, and then excise all the pus, fill the wound with carbolic medicine, sew the lips of the wound together, and care for it until it heals.
However, if the breast descends towards the groin and becomes softened like in women, then it should be cut in half along its upper surface with two incisions resembling a lunar shape, where each one is contained within the other according to this form from line B to line G. Excise the cords that are between the lips of the wound, remove the pus, and administer what has been said about suturing and powders until it heals.
And if you do not complete the incision that is necessary to make due to the distress of the patient and bleeding, then you must fill the wound with a thin layer of corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes the tissue that has turned gangrenous, and care for it until it heals.
Chapter .xlviii. [This line appears to be the title or chapter number for a section in the treatise, but it is not in the original language and may have been added by a later editor or translator.]
On the perforation of abscesses that arise near the nipple. [This line provides context for the previous lines about breast conditions, and it appears that the text is discussing a specific type of medical procedure.]
These abscesses near the nipple are of the species of scrofula, hard, which contains a sack. [This line describes the type of abscess that is being discussed in the following lines.]
And some of these contain moisture; those that contain moisture should be incised with a lunar section according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all the pus in the abscess is evacuated, you should fill it with dry gauze and leave it for another day. [This line explains the procedure for treating certain types of abscesses near the nipple.]
And the dressing should be changed and the area treated with appropriate ointment until it heals. [This line concludes the section on treating abscesses near the nipple.]
And if the abscess of the species of lymph nodes or scrofula is: [This line introduces a new type of abscess being discussed.]
If the sore has spread to such an extent that it exudes pus, then administer cautionery as previously mentioned.
In the fortieth Chapter...
On incisions of abscesses that occur by arrow or vein.
When an arrow is broken and the shaft that lies over it becomes consolidated, it may cause an abscess and signs that indicate whether inflammation and abscess are due to an artery or vein: for when an abscess is caused by an arrow, it runs along the front of the chest; and if you press on the abscess with your fingers, it will emit a sound.
And that which is due to a vein is rounded at the manifestation of the chest.
If an incision is made on the abscess, it is an error, especially in the areas of the shoulders, neck, and various parts of the body; and it is large, so its healing should be avoided, and if it is near the extremities or head, it should be avoided.
However, on the one that is due to inflammation of the opening of the arrow, make an incision along the shaft and then cut through the sheath; and open the incision with scissors and remove the arrow, and deliver the tunics up to where it is exposed.
And place the point of the awl on the other side and make it penetrate through that layer, and then extract the arrow by pulling it out in two places, which causes bleeding; but this is a good sign for your extraction of two arrows that are within the temple area.
And prick the place between the ligaments with a lance and let blood flow out until it is all drained, and the abscess is resolved.
And apply a cure that generates purge until the ligaments fall off; and treat it with appropriate treatments until it is healed.
If the abscess is due to an incision of a vein, then you must have at hand everything that is possible for treating the abscess and the wound; and insert the awl into the place where your hand has been, and make it penetrate through that layer; and use double thread until you extract it from the other side, and tie the abscess with a strong ligament as I have told you in the uva4 ligament between the two parts and at the ends of the thread.
However, if you fear that the thread will break, then insert the awl into the abscess and make the first incision of the awl; and tighten your four threads in four places.
Cut the abscess into the middle of it so that when you extract what is inside, then cut away the excess of the sheath and leave what remains connected.
And place a cushion of powder that you have soaked in wine and oil over the swelling, and apply the cure that is made with heat and cold until it is healed.
Chapter I: Abscess due to twisting of nerves.
Just as an abscess may occur in an arrow wound or vein, and similarly an abscess may occur in nerves when it occurs due to a blow or excessive labor, and so on.
It is most often found in the areas of the joints or ankles, or in any place where the joints are injured.
It is a serious abscess, and it resembles the color of the other body, and it is located in the larger areas that are swollen due to its pressure; and when the patient feels the pain, it appears like stupor.
It is not an abscess that runs along the front of the chest, and therefore, it does not have a sheath; it is damaged in all areas and does not extend towards the front or back.
Therefore, it is not necessary for those suffering in the joints to be wrapped with iron, because great cold will inevitably follow contraction.
However, one who has a headache or pain in the forehead is treated with spittle (saliva). If it is a small abscess, then you should use forceps and drain it.
If it is big, you should suspend it with unguent (ointment), excise it, and apply a dressing to it; then sew up the wound, and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter 1.
Of abscess section that happens near the mouth that happens in the stomach.
Soften thickened areas in the stomach and other parts of the body in those patients who are affected by what is called funguals (fungus) because it resembles those found in mushrooms, for whose roots are subtle but the heads are large; and the lips of these have already been opened, and it is a small one or an enlarged one.
And I have seen one, and in its stomach there were two growths that resembled mushrooms, but there was no difference between them in color or small size.
And the lips of these were turned inward and split open, and moisture flowed from it all the time.
Therefore, you should incise them and bind one with eighteen inches of thread. And the other with five inches.
And the operation in incision of theirs is that you should consider if the patient is humid, and the color of his urine is white, moist, subtle in size; then you should incise it with a cold knife, and be present to cauterize it over the fire because many veguadas (pus) will be expelled with little blood; and if there is bleeding, cauterize that.
And if the patient is poor and afraid, guard yourself from incision with iron; but take a new lead (lead) pill and hold it to the urine, using the method mentioned earlier; leave that for two days.
Then tie it in the narrowing of the lead pill; therefore, do not cease to strengthen the thick lead until it is excised and falls off on its own without work.
But if it is of large size, you should make incision on it where there is some cause for fear and anxiety, especially if it is in the stomach.
However, it is possible that you incise the entirety of it, and then cauterize it to prevent its return.
And cure that until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to incise a dark-colored, small, hard and regular growth because that is cancerous abscess.
I will remind you of the crab related to this.
Chapter 2.
On the treatment of the navel in a prominent way.
The navel is treated for various reasons: either due to fissures on the abdomen, from which tissues or intestines protrude as in other ruptures; or by blood flowing from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or by compressed bowel wind.
But if it is due to abdominal fissure and the protrusion of tissue, then the appearance of the boil is similar to that of the body; and it is lion-like in pain, and it appears in various ways. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then you must place it in the position where it had been previously retracted with much greater diversity; and when you press it with your fingers, it becomes hidden, and return it; and strong pressure is needed there, and it must be introduced with forceful bathing and vigorous effort.
But if it is due to moisture, then it does not become hidden when you press with your hand, nor is it compressed, nor is it painful.
And if it is due to blood, then the boil appears black and darkening in color.
But if it is due to rotten flesh, then the boil is heavy, large and hard, and it becomes filled up to a certain quantity.
And if it is due to wind, then the touch of it is painful.
The operation in this case is to consider whether the swelling of the navel is due to blood from an artery or vein, or wind; and if it is, you must refrain from treating it, because in such cases there is fear and dread, as taught in the chapter where abscesses from arteries and veins have been discussed.
And if the swelling of the navel is due to intestine or tissue, you must order the patient to lie on their back and remain extended; then hold the patient's abdomen taut in a circle around the entire navel, and order them to remain facing upwards between your hands; then surround the navel with a thin piece of cloth around the area that you have marked with the tension; and extend the size of the boil at the incision lines until it is very large; and tie it in the circle with strong thread or cord, taking care to make the tying method proper.
Then you cut the boil's incision across the middle and insert your finger into it to search for intestine; if you have not found or secured it with the ligament, then you extract any excrement and force the intestine back into the abdomen.
And if you have found tissue, then you take it with one hand; and cut away any superfluous parts of it.
But if it is in opposition to an artery or vein, you surround that area and return to your operation; take two needles and tie them with strong thread, and insert the needles into the circuit around the boil as described earlier, making them penetrate; then tighten the boil in four parts over the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and allow the stretched skin to fall back into place; or cut that which is thin and can be easily torn, and then care for it with ointments until it heals.
If the swelling of the navel is due to rotten flesh in it or moisture, then you must collapse the boil as previously stated and remove the blood or moisture that you find there, securing it; and care for it with ointments and consolidate the area.
Chapter XXXIII.
On the treatment of crabs (pediculosis pubis).
We have previously discussed the species of crabs and the method of treating it with medications, and we have stated that its cure should be swift to avoid ulcers; and we have stated that crabs are born from filth and caution in their treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes crabs can be eradicated from certain places where it is possible to do so, such as on the head or in the genitals, and they recommended removing all such crabs, especially when they are small at first.
But when it becomes old and large, you should not attempt to remove it, because it cannot be cured or I have never seen anyone succeed in doing so, nor has it been achieved before.
The operation in this case is as previously stated, that you should precede the patient and purge them of black bile for several days, and then fumigate them if there is obvious repletion.
Then prepare the patient with the preparations necessary for the operation, and procure any tools that are required; and ensure that the bed is well prepared with good linen until no cause of the itching remains. Let the blood flow out, and do not let it be abscessed lightly, squeeze the places, and remove the coagulated blood entirely with your hand or instrument, whichever is possible for you among the available instruments.
If you encounter difficulties with large blood clots in a vein or an artery, then cauterize it where the flow of blood stops, and care for it with other treatment until it heals.
Title: Chapter IV (Latin: Caput IV)
On the treatment of edema.
We have previously recommended, in the division, the types of edema caused by water and the signs of each type, as well as their treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only the type of edema caused by dropsy alone, and iron should not be used for the types of edema such as tympanites or hypoedema, because it is deadly.
When you have already treated this type of edema caused by tympanites with medicines and do not see improvement, then consider, since if the patient has achieved debility or is suffering from another form of edema such as that in the throat or abdomen (similar to those), then take care not to treat it with iron, for there is fear over this.
But if you find the patient with an excessive amount of vitality and not suffering from any other illness except edema alone, without infancy or old age, then the method for the operation is to lift the patient with your hands, and minister to him by pressing his abdomen with your hand, expel water from the lower part of the liver in this manner:
The reed should be of two sharp points, with a pointed end like a spatula; however, it should be of some small length, little by little, so that during the operation you do not enter the intestine, and you do not injure it.
And consider whether the generation of edema is from the intestines, since in that case you must distance yourself from the navel by about three finger widths to the right of the navel above the liver.
But if the generation of edema is due to a disease of the spleen, then your incision should be on the left side of the navel by about three finger widths.
And if the generation is from the liver, then your incision should be on the right side.
And it is necessary that your incision be above the rib where you wish for the patient to lie so that fluids do not collect at that place freely.
Then pierce the diaphragm with the instrument and enter the incision, lift your hand with the reed between the diaphragm and sphincter, and you will extract it; if the amount is about one nail or more.
Then pierce the sphincter until the reed reaches the location of the water. And then you extract it and insert an instrument in the shape of: It is similar to a silver cannula; it is made of silver or ivory or lion's hide, at the lower end of which there is a small hole, and at the sides there are three holes: two from one side and one from the other side; and it has a sharp point at its end like a feather, such as sometimes:
At the upper end of it (the instrument) is an armlet, because when the instrument is put in water, then take it off immediately from the instrument to evacuate the appropriate amount of water, for if you evacuate more than needed at that time, the patient may soon die due to the resolution of his animal spirit, or the quinsy (a complication of tonsillitis) which is approaching death.
"Evacuate the appropriate amount based on the potency of the liquid and according to what you observe about the patient's pulse and his condition."
"Then take out the instrument and retain the water that causes it, as soon as it is retained by the stopper that retains the hole on the tip of which you are recommended to pierce it in that manner."
"Repeat the process on another day if the patient tolerates it, and draw a small amount of water, doing so for several days with caution, and ensure that there is not excessive water left."
"But if you are worried about the patient and release a large amount of water, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and rub him with soap, and wait for a long time in the sun; and treat him with drying medicines until he is cured."
"Cauterize the stomach, and the liver and spleen near the water extraction, as I have previously mentioned in what is stated before."
Chapter 45.
On the treatment of children whose lochs are not perforated by urine.
Sometimes one of the children is born with his umbilical cord not perforated (or narrow or not in its place).
Therefore, it must be cauterized immediately upon birth with a thin sponge in this manner:
"Then insert a small leaden pin through the hole and tie it, leaving it for three or four days."
"And when he wishes to urinate and has discharged his semen, return him."
"If you do not tie the lead, it is possible that the urine passing over the area will not close this opening."
"But if the hole is narrow, treat it with a leaden pin as previously mentioned, for several days until it is widened."
"But in those cases where the hole is not in its place, they are led, which occurs because in such cases the umbilical cord is cut off at the end of the spine, preventing urination between the thighs. Until the penis is raised to the thighs with the hand, this should not happen; it is not for generation, as the semen cannot reach the mother according to rectitude, and it is a serious illness."
"The method of the operation is that the patient lies on his back, and you extend the head of the penis with your left hand using strong extraction. Then cut off the tip of the head of the penis at the location of the foreskin with a sharp spatula or feather, so that the meat of it resembles the head of the penis and the hole falls in the appropriate place as needed."
"And be aware that in your operation of blood flow, this often happens; therefore, pause at that point where you cause the bleeding and treat the wound until it is healed."
Title or Chapter. LVI (64 in Roman numerals)
On the albuginea that occurs in the foreskin at the head of the penis and pus, corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
Motes (growths) frequently occur in this albuginea on the penis and are prominences of fleshly growth.
And one (type of growth) is malignant and another is not malignant.
Non-malignant, it should be suspended with a thin thread and cut off the affected part until it is completely removed; then place a suppository of Egyptian balm on the submerged area and apply it daily until healed.
And if the albuginea is malignant and discolored, it is necessary to administer cautionery near its incision and its base.
But if the albuginea is in the foreskin at the head of the uncircumcised penis and one part of it is inside the foreskin and another part is outside, you must remove the albuginea that is inside first until it is consolidated; then treat the outside, for when you treat the outside along with the foreskin, there is no guarantee that it will not be crushed.
Moreover, blackness and corruption often occur in the genitals and foreskin; therefore it is necessary to hollow out everything that has become degenerate or is about to corrupt or is already corrupted; then line this with a solution made from scorched wheat flour and three times sifted and sieved.
Then apply the other treatment until it heals.
But if there is a flow of blood, administer cautionery in this manner:
Cautery is helpful in two ways: for blood flow and for an ulcer when it becomes corrupt.
And if the head of the penis is rotted and destroyed completely at that time, it is necessary that you insert a lead cannula into the foreskin to allow the patient to urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not recommended for it; and when adhesion occurs due to ulcer or abscess), you must separate it with a blunt spatula until the glue dissolves and the head of the penis is released from all sides.
If it is difficult to separate them exactly, you must separate the head of the penis and foreskin with a spatula, as the foreskin, when thin, is easily perforated due to its fragility.
Then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a thin blade that has been softened in hot water so that it does not adhere again later.
And apply a styptic to it until it is healed.
Title or Chapter. LVII (65 in Roman numerals)
On the purification of infants and treatment for those who have undergone circumcision.
Circumcision is not a cure for continuity like other diseases: however, since it is our action and its performance is in infants, it is necessary to assign the best method and easiest way possible to preserve health.
Therefore, they did not say circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience, which I have found that most craftsmen and barbers used circumcision and mutilation with a knife and torches; and they use balm for healing and incision with the nail.
And I have forbidden all these ways and will not find better mutilation with scissors, balm, oil or ointment for mutilation using the nail, because many times the wound heals more slowly, since the skin of the prepuce has two layers, and one layer remains behind, and it is prone to further incision and certain pain. And mutilation which is done for alum-treatment, and it is digital, used by cobblers, is not certain to incise the end of the male organ, since it often enters into its crack.
But in the operation with the nail, iron often corrodes and corrupts your operation. And the skin of the child is short by nature, and many times it does not need mutilation in this manner, and I have seen that.
But mutilation which is done with scissors and oil or ointment for healing, the benefit, experiment has shown me that the scissors are of proportional incision, therefore the sharpness that is above is similar to the sharpness that is below; so when you press your hand in proportionate two sharp points, and make an incision according to a comparison at a time; it compresses the oil or ointment in a figure containing the skin of the genitals from all sides, with which you cannot miss anything.
And the method of the first operation is that you let the child stay more if it is one of those who can understand a little, not doing anything but putting oil or ointment on his genitals only, and leaving him alone for another day.
And encourage that child in all ways that is possible according to his understanding. And encourage that child to stay among your women and be quiet; hide the scissors in your hand or place them under your foot, so that the child does not see those or any other of the instruments.
And approach your hand to the genitals of the child and blow on the skin, then pull it out as far as the head of the genitals, and mutilate that part which is attached to the scrotum for cleanliness.
The shape of the scissors for mutilation, this is its shape:
The one that are not cutting blades and the other is blades, neither of them should exceed the end of the handle, and the length of the two sharp points should be the same as the length of two handles.
But the error in mutilation is that iron often cuts all the inner skin or you should incise a part of it.
Therefore, you must stretch that with your hand in front of the wound site and make an incision according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then remove that with oil and make an incision.
But if three days have passed and the wound on the genitals is inflamed and not healed, you should let that out until the wound is cauterized and remove the pus with ease, then make an incision according to your preparation.
And be careful of the head of the genitals, since it will not be there.
And therefore heal that with what the plaster recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if the skin is incised to the correct measure and presses the parts above, it will not notice anything.
But heal that with what I said earlier until it is healed.
Chapter LVIII.
On the cure of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction made by stones or blood clots, or by pebbles or gravel, similar to those that I said in the division of cures.
And if it is not dissolved by the water mentioned previously and the cause becomes severe in the patient, then you must administer extraction of him with an instrument called syringe, which has this form: It should be made of silver and be thin like a lion's conch, similar to a bird's pen with subtlety of a ray about half a palm long, at the end of which there should be a thin tube.
The method of emptying the urine through it is to take the folded fabric or wool and place it on the exterior of it for good adhesion; then insert the fabric's edges into the opening behind the syringe, and cut any superfluous cause of the fabric with scissors, but insert the fabric into the tube forcefully. Then move the syringe towards the bladder and hold it with an alcohol-soaked bandage.
And cover the patient with a sheet and wrap the bladder and the penis with olive oil, water, and vinegar.
Then insert the syringe gently until it reaches the tip of the penis; then fold the penis over the opening of the urethra; then push the syringe inward towards the bladder, and the patient should feel relief from the cause as long as this order is followed, not moving in another direction.
And apply the small wool gradually, because the urine will soak the wool.
Remove that and apply a urine cure, use the syringe and do not stop applying it until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter 19.
On the quality of clysterization of the bladder with a clamps and similar instruments that are suitable for this purpose.
If there is an ulceration or boil in the bladder, or clotted blood in it, or thickened pus, and you want to distill waters and medicines for that, then do so with an instrument called clamps, and this is its form:
If there is no opening in its exterior, it is closed. And in that are three openings: two on one side, sometimes.
At the beginning is a concave area, in which there is an opening that is blocked by a certain amount of fluid. When any cause is drawn out from this area by the moisture, it should be removed, and when it is expelled, fluid should be added, and when it is expelled completely, as happens with the clamps used during naval battles, the same process should occur.
Therefore, to introduce moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clamps into the fluid and draw in the fluid that is blocking the openings above it because the fluid will be drawn into the concave area of the clamps.
And insert the end of the clamps into the penis as we recommended with the syringe; then push the fluid through it because that fluid will quickly reach the bladder and provide relief to the patient.
The form of a subtle clyster with which the bladder is clysterized, and this is its form:
And made of silver or lead, with the head resembling a small feather and a tube leading inside it.
And take the bladder from a dead person, and place the fluid you want to clysterize in the bladder, then tie it securely with two strings around it and heat the fluid over fire.
And insert the end of the clyster into the penis.
And place your hand over the bladder with the fluid and structure to ensure that the patient feels relief when the fluid has reached the bladder.
But if the bladder is not present, then you take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it; perforate it entirely around its circumference; and then insert a strong string through those openings, which should be twisted as they are inserted; and fill the circle with water and oil as if filling an eggshell, stopping at the fluid you want from the moisture.
And you apply it [the instrument] to that [affected area] and do as you did with the bladder, and press your hand inside so that the moisture reaches the bladder.
The sixty-first capital or chapter:
Chapter on Stone Removal.
In the previous division, we have discussed the types of stones and their treatment with medications, as well as the difference between bladder stones and kidney stones, along with their symptoms.
We have also mentioned the stone that requires surgical removal, as well as the incision to be made during the operation.
Bladder stones specifically are those that are lodged in the bladder.
And we shall now proceed with a detailed and concise explanation of the procedure.
Therefore, bladder stones usually affect children; and the symptoms of it are that the urine expelled from the bladder resembles water in its thinness, and appears in sand; and the patient experiences pain in the lower abdomen, and occasionally passes small blood clots; and as a result, there is a frequent urge to defecate.
The healing of children affected by bladder stones is usually achieved within twelve years, and it is difficult to treat in the elderly. However, in young women, it is more common for surgery to be performed rather than medication.
If the stone is large and treatment is easier, it is contrary to the case where the stone is small.
Therefore, at the beginning of the treatment process, the patient should be examined using a cystoscope that cleans out any obstruction in their bladder, as this sometimes prevents the passage of the stone.
Then place the patient with their feet and be careful that the stone descends towards the base of the bladder or jumps from its location after some periods.
Then prepare the patient well, and let their lower parts be exposed, so that the bladder is completely lowered towards the sides outward.
Then bring forth that and all of it outward.
If you feel the stone in the space, then you should immediately cut into it.
And if the whole thing cannot be extracted through touch, you must then anoint it with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or with flour if they are a young adult, and insert it into their rectum. Then remove the stone that is inside. Then gradually turn that small stone towards the neck of the bladder.
Then apply pressure on that with your hand and expel it at the sides outside through the place where you made the incision.
Command the assistant to press on the bladder with their hand; command another assistant with their right hand to extend the legs apart at the top and with their other hand move the linen which is below the legs, in the area where the incision was made.
Then insert the spatula of this shape: Cut it between the rectum and the thighs, not at the middle, near the left side; the incision should be on that stone and your hand should be in the rectum, and the incision should be transverse so that the incision outside is wide and narrow inside according to the amount of the stone that can be extracted, and not more, because you should press the stone with your hand which is in the rectum, and this must be done without difficulty.
You should know that the stone has some parts with angles and edges, which makes it difficult to extract it.
And from that, there is a part that resembles an almond and is round, and it is easily extracted.
Therefore, if it is that which has angles and margins, adjust in the fissure.
And if it is that which has angles and margins, do as follows: either you should clamp it properly with a tool appropriate to the task, or insert a curved, fine instrument into the area without removing it.
However, if you cannot clamp it, you should then slightly enlarge the wound and, if you see blood flow, cauterize it with diluted vitriol.
However, if the stone is multiple, begin by inserting your hand into the bladder and then make an incision over it; and place a small instrument near it; and do similarly with larger stones.
If the stone is very large, ignorance lies in making an incision too wide because this may cause harm to the patient, as one of two possible outcomes: either death or continuous urine drainage, because the area has not fully consolidated.
However, administer an emetic to help expel the stone before it leaves the body, or use forceps to extract it through a broken area if necessary.
Therefore, once you have completed your task, fill the wound with juice of aloes and dragon's blood, and cauterize it. Place a linen cloth soaked in oil and vinegar or olive oil and warm water on the wound to encourage the formation of a cauterized abscess.
Place the patient on their side and do not release the bandages for three days.
Once the bandages are removed, clean and dress the wound with warm water and oil, and cure it with a drying and absorbing agent until it is healed.
If an abscess forms in the wound, apply a drying and corrosive agent to it, similar to if blood is congealed in the bladder, for this is called urinary retention (and this is known by the outflow of blood with urine), so place your thumb in the wound and drain the blood, as if left untreated, it can cause a bladder infection and putrefaction.
And wash the wound with vinegar, warm water, and salt, and apply any other remedy appropriate for its healing until it is healed.
And during the entire healing process, you should stay with the patient and adjust any medications placed on the area.
If the stone is small and located in the penis and obstructs urine flow, you should treat it with remedies that promote expulsion rather than sectioning, as excessive observation during this treatment can lead to complications. I have already spoken of this before, and the remedy is to use a sharp metal probe (the shape of which is:
with a triangular external part, sharp, inserted into a rod or shaft.
And grasp the probe firmly and hold it close to the penis where the stone is located so that it does not return to the bladder.
And insert the probe into the penis with ease until it reaches the stone. And rotate the probe gently around the small stone with your hand until you make a hole through it, and then the water is released.
And press down on the area where the stone has been broken into pieces on the outside of the penis, as it is pierced and drained of urine, and the patient is healed.
However, if this treatment cannot be performed for any reason that prevents it, tie a string around the stone and another above it. And then make an incision in the penis between two scrotal folds. And extract it. Remove the bandages and clean the congealed blood in the wound.
Bandages are not required around the stone, but only to prevent it from returning to the bladder; however, the upper bandage is still necessary, as when the string holding the stone is removed near its exit, the area becomes infected and the wound reopens.
And for this reason, when you remove the upper bandage, you should raise the scrotum upwards or let it fall back down to complete your task, as I have said before.
Chapter LXI.
On the Extraction of Stones from Women.
Stones in women are rarely formed.
However, if a stone is found in any of these places, the treatment is difficult and is often prohibited due to its complexity.
The first one is because the woman who is not a virgin.
And the second is because you do not find a woman who knows how to cut if she brings it to the doctor when she is chaste, or from among women having husbands.
And the third is because you do not find a woman skilled in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is because the location of the section on stones in women is longer than that of stones, therefore it requires deep incision and there is fear.
But if necessity requires this from you, then you must take a woman assistant skilled, and it will be bound up.
But if you are deprived of that one, then seek a skillful and subtle woman, or present a mature woman experienced in the craft of women, or a woman who has been divided from this art.
So do that, and command her to perform all you will instruct her, from the inquiry of the stone at the beginning; which purpose is to determine if the woman is a virgin, then she should insert her finger into the anus and feel for the stone.
Then if you find it, close that off with your finger, and then command her to make an incision on it.
If the patient is not a virgin, command the midwife to enter her hand into the woman's vagina and examine the stone (the kidney), as she places her left hand on the bladder and compresses it firmly.
Once the stone has been located, it is necessary to gently guide it from the bladder opening towards the vaginal partition until it reaches the place of the womb.
Then insert the finger into that junction of the woman's cervix and find the stone in the womb from any side it is located, and press the stone firmly against that partition so that the stone does not move away from the cervix.
Make the incision small at the beginning; then insert the knife into that area and if you feel the stone, adjust the incision according to its size, as you know how large the stone is expected to be extracted through it.
Know that the types of stones are seeds: for some it is small and large, hard and rough, long and round, with roots.
So you know how many types there are of these stones, for what you intend to signify.
If you want to drain blood, adjust the location with crushed vitriol and keep it there for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your operation until the stone has been expelled.
Prepare your tools for the removal of stones in men's bodies, so that you may be assisted by them in your operation.
If you want to drain blood and know that the expulsion of blood is through an artery that is incised, then you pause powder over the location and press it with pulverizers and tighten the ligature, but do not apply any pressure; allow the stone to remain and do not extract it, for great harm could befall the patient. Care for the wound.
Once the flow of blood has ceased and the wound heals, return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
Chapter LXII (62).
On incision for hernia of the inguinal region.
An inguinal hernia is not simply an accumulation of moisture in the scrotum that contains the bladder, and it is called a scrotum.
Sometimes the swelling is in the scrotum itself, which nature has prepared for it near the bladder until it becomes another bladder; and this is the bladder between the white scrotum that we have mentioned, and it is not just that.
The generation of this hernia is due to weakness that occurs in the bladder, so this matter accumulates there; sometimes it occurs due to a blow struck on the bladder.
This moisture has stones of various colors: its color may be yellowish or blood-red, red, black and putrid, or watery white, and this is the most common.
The signs by which it is known that this water accumulation occurs are: if it is in the white scrotum that we have mentioned, then the abscess is round and extends slightly in length like a bladder figure, and the bladder can be seen, as the moisture contains it all over.
If the moisture is in the scrotum itself, then the abscess is round and separated from the bladder, and for this reason it is estimated that it is another bladder.
If the moisture is between the bladder and the white scrotum, make an incision at the center.
To know the color of the moisture, examine the color of the moisture in the abscess by cutting open the cavity whose shape is preceded; and based on the findings from the cavity, judge what is inside it.
When we come to the treatment of this disease, it is necessary that we command the patient to be bled if possible, and sometimes empty his body.
Place a soft bed under the patient's back on some occasion for a short time and let him rest with many cloths.
Place yourself on the left side of the patient and command the assistant to follow on his right side, who should stretch out his hand from two fingers to the bladder and the area of the navel.
Take a broad stick and cut the bladder in half from the same location up to the penis.
Make the incision according to a straight line parallel to the line of the pubic hairs, until it reaches the white scrotum encompassing.
Remove it, observe it, and note that you do not make another incision; and your excision that was made through the separation should be suspended more gently and more finely examined compared to the excision according to the size possible for you.
Approach, puncture the bladder filled with water with a wide incision, and drain all the water out of it.
Approach and separate the labia majora of the vulva with stitches, spread it apart; do not touch the ligaments that connect the bladder to the genitals, and make an incision in the bladder in such a way as is feasible for you. Make the incision all the way through or in pieces, and especially its thin side, because if you do not scrutinize the incision carefully, it is not assured that the water will not return.
However, if the water flows out from beyond its ligament during your operation, then when you have completed the bladder incision, return it within, and then sew together the two labia majora of the vagina with stitches, and take care of the wound in the same way as other wounds until it heals.
If you find that the water has become corrupted due to another disease, then it is necessary for you to remove the supporting vessels, extract the water, and treat the wound as I have said.
However, if the water accumulates in two parts as an example, then you know that there are hernias; therefore, incise that part as you did in the other operation; and if it is visible that it is a hernia, then you should perform the operation.
Approach and place the linen, immerse it in oil or red oil, and place another linen that you have soaked in wine and oil on top of it, spreading it over two genitals and the abdomen; then place doubled and padded cloths over it, and lie them down with the string that is shaped like this:
Approach and press two cloths soaked in camomile-infused linen as shown; make the ends of the cloths that are pressed with cotton or damp linen meet with each other, and tie them together with a string in the waistband of the underwear; one end should grasp the anus between the buttocks, and the other should grasp at the scrotum split, and two ends on each side for the thighs, and all the ties should be adjusted in the waistband of the underwear.
Some hernias are treated artificially with cautery at the incision site using iron; and it is that you take a thin cautery knife, make an incision in the vaginal wall, ignite it as recommended until the white bladder containing the water is discovered, and then take cautery as follows: It resembles the Greek letter.
Approach and puncture that bladder, and ignite it until all the moisture is expelled.
Approach and spread the bladder with stitches, excise it with stitches, excise it with a thin cautery that is ignited; incise it as feasible until you remove everything; and be careful of the water so that the fire does not touch it.
You should know that this operation is safe and long-lasting without bleeding, and better than an operation with incision.
However, if you encounter an abscess in the incision or cauterization time, or bleeding, it is necessary that you treat the problem that is causing it as appropriate according to what has been said.
However, if the patient is weak and does not expect the second operation due to its horrible nature, you should administer puncture as I recommend; and it is when you are certain that, according to what has been said about the signs, that this hernia is watery.
It is necessary that you place the patient on some raised platform, approach and puncture the abscess in the lowest part of it with a thin cannula, and stop the puncture according to the length of the body.
The incision should be wide enough to drain all the water.
Place your hand over the area and press it down, leaving it there, to let the remaining water drain out. Take care of the wound until it heals.
However, if the contrariety is due to the influx of water at that time you perform puncture: and this should not be done unless the white panniculus in the wound opening causes contrariety and prevents the discharge of water, then it is necessary for you to place a pen or instrument in the wound to extract the water from the edema, whose shape is as follows; or adjust on the pressure of the wound a small.
You should know that the water returns after about two months or even earlier, and when it accumulates, it is necessary to perform puncture again in that manner, because the patient will go through their days.
Chapter 13.
On incision for fatty hernia and its treatment.
You should know that in the incision of this hernia there is great danger, and so I consider its abandonment and being saved by another method to be more advantageous.
And I remember the operation for that and the signs of abscesses.
Therefore, say that abscesses arise in the bodies where the genitals are composed and it is made for various reasons: either due to acute sharp excess, which is poured into the genitals, or due to injury.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and it is not found in pain, and it is a severe abscess.
A large boil is an abscess, whose color is dark, and it does not open by itself.
Some swellings are caused by the knotting of the arteries and inflammation of those same ones, as the memory of it is perceived, or inflammation of veins.
But that which is due to inflammation of the arteries is recognized by the dispersal of the abscess when it is pressed with fingers, and it does not need to be touched.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein cannot be dispersed by any means due to pressure with fingers.
And it is possible that on this type surgery may be performed and on other flesh; and you should make an incision in the genitals, place your fingers at the junctions above, and extract that from the white cavity, and release the suspenders of the vessels, tie them up, and make an incision where you have released it from all parts of the junction of the fingers.
Therefore, if the cavity is already consolidated with those flesh parts, you must then extract the cavity and incise it.
And if there is adhesion due to any cause within the cavity, or between the vessels, you must then release all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if it is native flesh in the location of the adhesion which is behind, you must then incise all that which is there and extract the cavity as previously stated.
Therefore, when your operation is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in oil and wine, and take care of it with other care until it heals.
Chapter LXIV.
On the cure of a hernia that is acute.
Acute abscess is an abscess enveloped by some envelop like a bulb with softening of the testicles, and it makes difficult exercise and walking for the patient.
And in the cure of this illness, it is done out of fear of what precedes the memory.
However, you must perform the operation as the first ones did.
Say that you must lay the patient on a raised couch; and spread the suspenders of the testicles at the junctions below; and hold the genitals with your fingers at the buttocks which are proven in the anus; and have another minister who helps you, and stretch them out with vigorous extension.
And spread apart with a sharp, pointed scalpel in a crosswise section through the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then scrape off all parts as you said in the removal of the artery, which are on the temples.
And then insert an awl with a double point into those places where the abscess occurs, and let one of them go through the first place where it occurs, and let the other swelling pass through the other end of them. And then incise those places in the middle with a right section according to the length of the body and extract what is accumulated of foul and corrupted moisture.
And take care of the wound with care of other wounds where it is desired that vessels not be generated, since only one testicle should not be harmed.
But if the abscess occurs in all the buttocks, you must then extract the testicles or make them blind to the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nutrition by the incision of the vessels, and made immobile, or make them blind so that they are not helpful for those.
Chapter LXV.
On the cure of intestinal hernia.
The onset of this hernia is due to a section that extends in the cavity extended over the abdomen from the sides of the mirror of the abdomen, so that the intestines protrude through one of its junctions.
This rupture is either of the cavity or of the extension of it, and this happens due to various causes: impact, sneezing, shouting, lifting a heavy load, or something similar.
The sign of this, when it is due to extension of the cavity, is that it occurs gradually over a long time and does not occur suddenly, and it becomes an abscess in the groin because the cavity presses the intestine.
The sign of this is when it is due to a section of the cavity, because at the beginning it causes violent pain suddenly; and the abscess appears different from the proximate apparent one, and that is precisely the intestine, and the body of it outside the junction of the cavity.
Some occurrences of hernias involving the intestine are forgotten without the tissue, and this type of internal hernia is called "zirbal."
Some times it is caused by wind, and some times it occurs when the hernia splits open and remains unnoticed, causing grave danger for the patient, and sometimes it causes severe and painful complications, especially when pressure is applied.
In the treatment of this disease with spices, caution must be exercised to avoid the danger of poisoning in the process.
The method of operating on that hernia is to command the patient to push the intestine back into its cavity using their own hands until it returns, and then wrap a cloth around it between their buttocks, and lift their legs.
Then tie the cord that secures the scrotum at the opening, and cut through the entire scrotum; and then insert two fingers into the incision to divide the scrotum as needed.
And if the division of the scrotum is according to the quantity that you can comfortably avoid leaving any part unattended.
Then excise the tissue that is left behind after removing the scrotum, until the white hard mass of each division is exposed.
Then you insert your finger into the opening that exposes the white mass left behind from the scrotum, between the masses, and remove any adhesion in the area behind the testicle.
Then wrap the cord around the testicles at their openings, and with your left hand remove the white mass from each, and lift the testicle along with the white mass to the incision site; and command the assistant to stretch out the testicle beyond it, and you dissolve the adhesion behind it using a complete solution.
Search for any signs that there may not be a cause for the hernia being wrapped in the hard white mass. If you find a cause, then push it back into the abdomen.
Then make an incision on the remaining part of the scrotum where pus and blood will flow as we previously recommended.
Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound and wait; then apply the recommended stitches (and sometimes the white mass is cauterized, which we mentioned earlier to prevent bleeding, as this often occurs), and leave the stitch until it falls out on its own.
If the danger persists, boil some water and soak a cloth in it, then apply it to the wound until it falls off as we previously said.
Take care of the wound with other methods for treating wounds until it heals.
Chapter LXVI.
On Hernias (Wind-related).
In this hernia, there is no known effective treatment for it.
The initial treatments for this hernia were to follow the recommendations we have previously provided in treating hernias related to wind; that is, to place the instruments close to the incision with ease, and then seal the area around the wound with an ointment or other appropriate dressing until the wound heals and the instruments fall out.
Take care of the wound as we previously said until it heals.
Title. LXVII.
On the rupture that occurs in hernias.
Sometimes ruptures occur in hernias as we have said, and it is worth noting the location.
And do not tell the genitals any cause for hernias to the genitals; and if they do, it is rare; and it always returns in all hours.
But if the time is prolonged without it, a fissure should be made in the cavity before the hernia appears in the cavity; and this occurs due to the extension of the cavity which is in hernias as we have said, which causes the cavity to be stretched out, softened, and the location exposed, and it becomes enlarged.
And the treatment for this is with a cautery as previously described.
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this method: and the patient lies on their back with your hands holding them, and the location of the rupture of the hernia is dried up by pressing on it with a press of three fingers' width in its length.
And tightly hold the white cavity below the navel until it is exposed.
And grasp the rod and place it on the prominent part of the cavity, and press it against the belly.
And close the two prominent parts at the end of the rod of the cavity with stitching.
And remove the end of the rod, and do not insert it into the cavity, nor extend the hernia or any other cause as you know in the treatment of internal hernias.
And treat that with the treatment of ulcers, and when you insert the fingers, clean it and restore the ulcer inside until it is consolidated; because the cavity contracts and the prominence of the rupture is not adjusted.
Cauterization is better in this location, because it is closer to health.
Title. LXVIII.
On the softening of the scrotum of the testicles.
Sometimes the scrotum of the testicles in some men is softened by this method because the flesh between it is softened, and the care of it should be observed.
Therefore it is necessary for the one who treats it to make the patient lie on their back, and insert all of the scrotum that has been softened through the natural scrotum, and sew the two labia together.
And if desired, cut off the excess of the softened scrotum with three stitches or four, and firmly sew it.
And insert between the stitches; and treat by treatment of other ulcers until it is healed and the pus falls.
Title. LXIX.
On Castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, but I mention it here because it is relevant to this book; and the reminder of it is only necessary in two cases: one is when the doctor asks about it because he knows its treatment when it occurs; the other reason is that we often need to perform castrations on animals for our use, such as horses, cows, pigs, and similar animals.
And so it is said that castration can be done in two ways: either through tearing or by making an incision.
But in the case of castration by tearing, the method for this operation is that we seize the animal by the testicles in warm water until they become softened and swollen and hang down. Then carefully take hold of them with your hand inside until they are resolved and do not appear again afterwards.
But in the case of castration by incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the scrotum of the testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the spermatic cords and make an incision on each one to about two inches deep.
And then carefully remove the testicles, taking care not to damage them or the surrounding tissues. Do not leave any cause on those areas other than a thin thread, which is placed over the vessels.
The method of castration by tearing is better because it leaves less cause for the testicles to swell, thus the animal will not desire copulation.
And carefully treat the wound until it heals up.
Chapter LXX.
On the treatment of Hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in males occurs in two ways: the first is when a hole appears in the scrotum between the testicles, where there appears what resembles female labia.
And sometimes this condition also causes the testicles to expel urine from the scrotum.
But in females, it is a different case: where the female genitalia at the pubis resemble two testicles of a male, slightly smaller and located at the base of the penis, similar to the scrotum of a man and two testicles.
And the treatment is for three cases: two in males and one in females. It is necessary to make an incision in the affected areas and to remove the excretion that comes from it, and then treat those areas with other remedies for other wounds.
In the second case of males, where urine comes from the scrotum, there is neither treatment nor operation for it.
Chapter XXI.
On Lengthening and Swelling due to Female Causes.
Lengthening is a natural process that occurs when the vagina is stretched and becomes larger, following the natural regimen; but in some women it becomes exaggerated to such an extent that it spreads out like in men and enters the uterus.
Therefore, it is necessary to remove the excess of lengthening with your hand or a syringe and make an incision.
And do not deepen the incision, especially near the cervix, to avoid bleeding.
And treat that area with remedies until it heals up.
However, swelling is the flesh that grows within the abdomen of the mother before delivery, and it extends outward near the vaginal opening, similar to lengthening (and for this reason some people call it "postpartum disease"); therefore, it is necessary to make an incision in the same way as we do with lengthening, and treat it until it heals up.
Chapter LXXII.
On the treatment of Ulcers (or sores).
An ulcer is when the female genitalia is not pierced or torn in some way. It can be either natural or accidental.
Accidental is when the ulcer has previously been caused by disease, and that can be due to excess flesh or thin or thick thread.
It is caused either in the mother's perineum, her costal area, or the superficial or deep pus, and it is forbidden to have sexual intercourse, to engage in pregnancy, and to menstruate, and it is also forbidden to menstruate.
The recognition of the ulcer is done by the midwife, if the opening is visible, it should be sewn up with silk thread or ray; but if it is not visible, you should search for it with your fingers or with the rod (a medical instrument).
But if the opening is due to thin thread and is close to the two labia, you should catch it and tear it apart.
And place your fingers on both labia and indicate which one is the most swollen first.
The woman should be in the same position, with her legs apart and extended, and gently pull both labia until the thin thread is torn and the opening is exposed.
Apply wool, soak it in oil and place it on the affected area, and change it daily to ensure that the wound does not heal prematurely.
If the boil is large and swollen, then you must lance it with a lancet or a myrtle leaf.
If the abscess is caused by an ulcerated wound, suspend it with an ointment, and then lance it.
And here are the medicines that stop bleeding without cutting, such as henbane, dragon's blood, and mastic resin, mixed with white wax.
Then administer a large leaden cannula to prevent the wound from healing too quickly.
Keep it for several days and apply hot compresses to it.
Then let it heal naturally with the other methods of treatment until it is healed.
Sometimes it happens during childbirth for other women's flesh, and then you must lance it according to this method. If it is an abscess with cancerous growths in the womb, do not oppose it with iron in any way.
Chapter LXXIII.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, piles, and red botches that occur in the woman's cone (vagina).
Hemorrhoids are recognized by the openings of many veins from which blood continuously flows, and long-standing hemorrhoids are usually fibrotic (hardened).
And I have already explained the species and signs of those (hemorrhoids and piles), and I will say which ones receive treatment and which ones do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and piles inside the cervix (womb) that are not felt through sensation should not be treated with iron.
But those that are in the orifices of the womb where you can feel them are the ones that should be treated.
You must place the woman in greater heat and hold her thigh apart with a hot iron or sharp cloth, and cut through those areas with scissors.
Then powder over those areas the flow of blood from one of the crushing powders without biting, similar to ashes and resembling those (similar items).
Then wrap her feet in cloth for an hour and place them in cold water.
If the bleeding continues, then make a decoction of sumac, coriander seeds, garlic and similar herbs.
Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and wine, make a paste with water and apply it to the affected area.
If the blood is separated, that's good; if not, make it adhere with two forceps, and scarify the nipples.
Then take wool and soak it in the juice of colander or arnica or elderberry and wine vinegar, then apply it to the affected area to promote healing.
Then heal that wound until it is healed.
Chapter LXXIV (74)
On the perforation of an episiotomy in a woman.
Many types of postpartum abscesses can occur in a woman, such as pus-filled abscesses, cancerous tumors, ulcers, hernias, epitheliomas, fistulas, hemorrhoids, and other abscesses. And I have previously discussed these illnesses and the species of each as well as their signs and remedies in the appropriate sections.
And it is necessary that I explain in this treatise the cautery for postpartum abscesses when they are accompanied by pus, and if you want to know how the operation is performed using iron.
Therefore, you must consider whether the pain of the abscess at its onset is sharp with beating and throbbing and fever, and if it swells and if pus forms on it, do not cut into it (perforare), but instead treat it with a solution that promotes maturation until the symptoms subside.
Then you must make an incision in the woman on a cutting board with two cutting boards; she should lie down on her back and adjust her feet beyond the abdomen, and her thighs should be spread apart, and her arms should be placed below her elbows, with each one at its appropriate position.
Approach the midwife following the straight path and administer the instruments with which to open the mother's orifices, the shape of which will come according to those cases that require it.
It is necessary when administering this instrument that you insert it in the woman's vagina, and whatever part of the instrument goes into the woman should not be more than her vagina and the patient. But if the instrument is larger than her vagina, then it is necessary to place powder on the texture of the woman's vagina to prevent any instrument from entering the woman's vagina.
It is necessary that the worker adds a lubricant to the instrument of the birth-knife and the person administering it should turn it until it is inserted into the mother's orifices.
When the head of the child appears, it should be seized with the hand and pulled out by the scalp, then it is necessary to cut its nape with a linen cloth.
When the afterbirth is evacuated, then it is necessary to place a compress soaked in rose oil or other oil with some stimulating properties in the incision on the woman's perineum. And place the calica (cloth used for delivery) in the section in the woman's vagina.
Cover the mother and place a pure linen cloth soaked in boiled water containing malva herb on top of the loins (lower back).
And have it treated for approximately two days with a warm poultice, which is appropriate until it is healed.
After some time, the mother and the wound are washed with water and honey, and over it is applied water in which are boiled radish or long-term arista (materia medica), and then return to the poultice.
And if the wound inside the mother is swollen, then it is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, having care for it as has been said in the section.
Chapter LXXV.
To teach midwives how to treat ectopic pregnancies when they occur according to the figure not natural.
It is necessary that the midwife recognize in the beginning the figure of natural conception by signs of it, and when you see the woman expel at childbirth and desire to smell the air, and above it is shaved what is on her, and the infant is hastened, then know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and the infant's head comes out first, and the second one with it or suspended or hanging from the navel.
Therefore, when you see those signs, it is necessary that the woman's abdomen be pressed so that the infant descends gently, because when it comes out on its head, the second one follows, and it is cleaned of those excesses with good hygiene.
But the one who is born with this non-natural and unlawful birth is not worthy of life, because when the infant is expelled on its feet and its body is facing backwards towards its head and its feet are the first to come out, and one of its hands or feet. or the head and hand of the infant is born, or the belly of it, and it turns violently on its neck, and similar to the figures of the unlawful births.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in all these cases, and avoid error and disappointment.
And we will show the entire figure of these, and what method is in them so that it may be understood and stand on that.
When the delivery is expelled facing forward naturally, and it is violent on the woman and difficult to deliver, and sometimes its power has already weakened, then do the following: either have the woman sit or use a squatting stool, and evaporate the condensation of it with fennel oil and humid oils.
And the midwife places a narrow spatula between her teeth and cuts the second infant, or cuts it with her nails into it until the moisture in it escapes. And press the woman's abdomen so that the foot is expelled.
But if it does not come out, then the woman should be shaved with chicken feathers and fennel mucilage with scissors.
And call it out loudly, have it shaved, and press it so that it vomits with a cloth; hold its mouth and nose with one hand for an hour, because the infant will soon be forgotten if not done so quickly.
And if both hands of the infant are forgotten at the beginning, then it is necessary to reduce them with gentle force little by little. But if the instrument does not enter, then the woman lies on a stool and raises her feet above it, and have the stool pressed down on the ground, and the woman should be held so that she does not fall backwards.
If the hands are not turned inside out and the infant dies, then cut them and remove the rotten part of the infant or pull the body with a cloth and remove it equally, because it will soon be forgotten.
When the infant is born on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards, and turn the infant small, and hold the head and stretch the legs little by little.
But since he is inside the thighs, you command him to express himself, and make him strain as if he were defecating, because it will be forgotten if God so wishes.
And if what has been recommended is not forgotten, you return the stool little by little inside, until the second figure (or position) occurs naturally, because it will be easily forgotten then.
And if everything that has been recommended is prohibited, you take alum and dissolved beeswax, grind them thoroughly in a mortar, and apply the mixture to the woman's womb, near the bottom of her stomach. Then you place that cyst in cold water until the hypogridium (or pubic bone) is found.
And when the parts left of him are softened, you perform subfumigation with myrtle and allow it to rest on him. When the subfumigation lasts for an hour, you then place it on a dish and make it vomit, open its mouth, and remove it, and press gently on the lower part of the woman's stomach with light compression, because it will be forgotten quickly.
Immediately after the procedure, the patient should be kept on one side. Try to reduce the swelling of his arm, but if that cannot be done, raise the woman and make her urinate.
And if urinating is not possible, lay the patient on his side and shake his thighs with violent shaking, and administer the medicines that I and have recommended for mucilage.
If childbirth has begun, you should place the woman on a dish and study the reduction of her arm, gently guide the fetus according to its natural position, make her vomit, and command her to compress herself until it is forgotten.
Immediately after the procedure, place the woman on her back, spread her legs apart, and open the passageway of her pelvis (or vagina) to the size of her mother's thighs. It is necessary that the midwife hold the baby's arm and gently turn it little by little, and that she do so with ease.
And when it has been turned and what needs to be done is completed, pause on the area of his head that we have recommended with oil and mucilage.
Then command the woman to push little by little, and when you have felt that she has done so, place the dish beneath it and command her to be inclined towards the right side, and then command her to compress herself; and make her vomit with care. Delivery of the fetus is prepared on the side (or "delivering the baby on its side").
When someone is suffering from abscess of the mother (mastitis) according to this method, consider, and then you shall incise the second nipple with your nail until it is drained of moisture.
And if the patient is suspended by the face and neck, then you shall incise the umbilicus to prevent it from becoming trapped and dying.
Then move the patient to the birth canal (bed) until you stop the bleeding, and order the woman to hold her breath a few times, and the wound will heal quickly if God wills it.
The outcome of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins born in quick succession are rare and sometimes triplets or even four, but this is strange and difficult to predict; however, it is due to nature and not life.
Tell the mother who has given birth to twins (or multiples), even if there are more than two, that one of them will be separated by cesarean section, distinguish between the infants at the umbilicus of each, and sometimes a delivery may occur naturally quickly and easily, and sometimes it may require an unavoidable cesarean section as we have advised.
And if it is difficult to deliver any of them, and you reach what we have said about unnatural births, then care for them as we have advised.
And if the mother is skillful and knows how to facilitate and expedite delivery, as well as slow it down when necessary, she must be ingenious according to every figure as she has been prepared by the art of medicine leading to health.
Remember that it is formed in the womb from embryos and aborts.
Some weeks are composed of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and more days. However, it is essential to confirm that a woman has given birth after five or more weeks, and another after twelve months, which was determined by the measurements of the wise.
And all of this concerns the knowledge of the midwife, for she must be careful with what appears similar to that (pre-eclampsia or pregnancy complications), and act accordingly.
Chapter LXXVI.
On the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you care for a dead fetus according to what we have said in the division of medicine and it has not yet been extruded, and you must use force, then you must consider if the woman is of good health and is not one of those in whom danger is feared due to certain accidents.
Then you must position the woman on her left side with her head tilted down and her hips raised.
And the minister shall hold her from both sides or bind her on her left side to prevent the body from extending during the extraction of the fetus.
Then you shall moisten the mouth of the womb with oils, aloe vera, fennel seed and other herbs.
Then you shall anoint the midwife's hands with those oils and mucilages, and insert her hand into the womb with ease, and then place her fingers in the fetus.
And suitable places in him are as follows: consider if the head is to be treated, then fix the uncus (instrument) in the temples of it, or at the neck, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or under the beard, or in the furcula (clavicle), or in the places proper to the ribs, or under the hypochondriac region.
If it is to be treated on his feet, then in the metatarsal or mid-ribs.
The uncus must be held with the right hand, bending its curve at the location between the fingers of the left hand and inserting the hand easily into it, and pushing the uncus into one of those places mentioned earlier until reaching the affected part.
Place another uncus or the third one if necessary near it to draw in and prevent its extension only along its straight direction.
Ensure that it is good on all sides, so that the pain is relieved as much as possible like in tooth extraction during removal of it.
And in the place that is between them, the extension should be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then it is necessary to anoint some uncus with oil and insert them skillfully and rotate them against what is retained.
Therefore, if the affected part is forgotten, the uncus should be pressed into the place that is deeper inside; do this until all the affected part is expelled.
But if the hand is outside the other, and it cannot be reduced by compression, then it must be wrapped; extract it until all of it is expelled, and make an incision either in the joint or at the wrist.
And do the same with the other hand and both feet.
But if the head of the affected part is large or it has compression in the pain, or water is collected at the head, then insert between the fingers sponges soaked in spinous herbs and cut open the head and drain the water, or else open it with an instrument called "alundat", whose shape will be similar to those of other instruments as described in the following section.
Do the same if the affected part is naturally large: then make an incision with a scalpel or open it with the instrument described earlier; and carefully remove the bones using forceps.
If the head is swollen and compressed at the clavicle, then make an incision to drain the moisture in the feet.
But if it is not complicated or swollen due to obesity, then make an incision on the head as soon as possible.
If the abdominal wound is purulent or liquid, then it is necessary to make a hole in it until the moisture within is drained.
But if the affected part is on his feet, then the pull of it is light and the direction to the mother's mouth is light.
But if it is compressed in the abdomen and feet, then you must extract it with a cloth that has been wrapped around your hand, and make an incision in the abdomen and feet until the moisture within runs out.
But if the other members are lost and the head remains, then insert the left hand; but if the mother's mouth is blocked, insert the right hand into her vagina, seek out the head, draw it with the fingers towards the mother's mouth, and carefully introduce an uncus or two into it and pull on them.
And if the mother's mouth is blocked by an abscess caused by ulceration, then do not press on it; instead, apply moist oily solutions. Apply poultices; and follow the patient in warm baths that soften and moisten.
And if the affected part is on his side, then if possible, lance it; and apply what was said in the previous section about a living wound.
And if that is not possible, make an incision in pieces, and extract it.
Ensure that no cause remains inside the second one (the fetus).
And when you have completed your operation, administer what was said about the treatment of abscesses caused by the mother.
And if there is bleeding, apply styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman in the womb who was dead, and on top of that fire another woman observed, and that woman was also dead. A pustule appeared on the man for a long time in his navel; it swelled until a burning sensation was felt, and blood began to flow.
I was called to treat him, and I treated him for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
Then I applied plasters with strong attraction and extracted a bone from it, and after several days, another bone was extracted; and I was greatly amazed, as there are no bones in the abdomen.
And then I thought that they were bones of the dead fetus.
Therefore you compress the wound, and extract from it any small bones that may be present in its position within the bladder, as it has been living in such a manner for a long time, cure it with a splint of wood.
And you should not be surprised if it seems strange, for in this knowledge and help the physician applies his hand to treat it.
Of the types of instruments that are necessary to remove the object.
A form of a hook, which is used to open the vein:
This is the form of a tourniquet in which the limbs are bound, at which binding there are two advantages at each end of two straps. However, this advantage must be as thin as a tourniquet, and made of yew or willow wood.
And the length of each stick should be double its width and the edge of both should be one digit, and the length of each is one palm and a half; and in the middle of two sticks there are two adjustments of that same stick, which are already fastened, the length of which is slightly more than the length of one palm, and the width of each is double digits, or slightly less.
And these two adjustments are inserted into the mouth of the vein so that it may be opened with the prescribed advantages when you twist the two previously mentioned advantages.
Another form resembling that which is thinner and lighter:
It should be made of yew or willow wood, similar to forceps. However, at its end there should be two adjustments such as often happens, and the length of these adjustments is one palm, and the width of each is double digits.
And when you want to open the vein, then you should press the woman on the sides so that her legs are hanging down, opening what is between her thighs. And approach with your hand using the tool similar to forceps, tightening it according to the size of the vein's mouth that you want to enter up to where you desire.
The form of a hook which the ancients called:
The form of a ramming tool with which you push the object:
The form of an amputator with which the large head is crushed:
And it is similar to forceps with teeth at the end, as sometimes happens, and some times it is made long like forceps according to this form, as sometimes happens, with teeth like those of a rasp, with which it is incised and crushed. A form of an amputator in small size:
A form of a probe with a single thorn:
A form of a probe with two thorns:
A form of a spatula with two ends, with which the head is cut off:
A form of two broad spatulas:
All these instruments must be practiced, and when they are multiplied and the types of each are increased and prepared, the physician should choose the one that is lighter in operation and easier for the patient to use.
And do not delay with any of these instruments, because the need for them is not excused.
On the extraction of the stone (kidney stone).
When the stone is retained, you must command the patient to empty their bladder, and then make her vomit with conditioning, and press your hand on the mouth of it and on its nose, and if by this means it comes out from outside, that is good.
And if not, then you take a cup and perforate its cover with a hole and place the following herbs inside it: calmant, ruda, anethum, camomile, arabic scissors, cassia wood, and saint-john's wort. All these herbs or some of them are immersed in water in the cup and place it over the fire.
And approach a glass tube in the mouth of the vein and hold it inside until the steam reaches the cavity of the vein.
And make her vomit as we have said, and the stone will be expelled quickly.
However, if this treatment remains and the stone does not come out, command the midwife to immerse her left hand in oil of sage or mustard seeds, and approach it to the stomach and try to find the stone there, and when you have found it, take it out a little at a time. But if it is attached to the bladder, then insert your hand as we have recommended, and when you find the stone, extract it gently so that the bladder does not contract violently. The abdomen must be tightly bound on the right and left sides with ease.
If the mouth of the mother is narrowed, we have already recommended the cure through vomiting and with oil and herbs.
But if none of the causes that have been recommended are forgotten, then you must be careful not to overdo the extraction from her, but rather it is necessary that what has come out of her into the mouth of the mother should be placed in the female's cavity and covered with salve and a four-fold medication; for this will make her swell for about three days, then dissolve, and disappear.
But when she swells, the evil authority rises to the head and stomach, and afflicts the patient; therefore, something should be administered under fumigation and in accordance with this.
But one of the ancients has already spoken of a fumigation of garlic and dried figs.
The shape of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated should have the ability to retain menstruation and afterbirth:
It should be made of iron or of earth.
Then let the narrow part be placed in the cavity and the wide part above the fire, and the fumigation should be placed on the arms of the fire.
And let it contain within itself that which is consumed by the fumigation, and repeat another one.
Treatment for the anus of the unborn child.
Newborn infants and their anuses that are not perforated, which are soft and open. Therefore, the midwife must perforate the soft and open anus with a pointed instrument; otherwise, she should perforate it with a sharp spatula and ensure that she does not touch the rectum.
Then cover it with wool soaked in wine and oil, and treat it with salve inside until it is healed.
But if you fear that it may open again, then cover it with a tube for several days, and remove it when the child wants to relieve itself.
And there often occurs obstruction of the anus due to consolidation of a wound or abscess; therefore, that consolidation must be incised and treated with what has been said about treatment and lead.
Treatment for fistulas that have descended.
Fistulas that descend into the descents are often thick and swollen, which occur near the anus or in the space of one of the descents.
And it is a fistula or a boil.
And when the thickening is old and turns from the foul, white moisture or subtle pus, some of these fistulas may penetrate.
And those that penetrate are recognized by what is expelled from them through the opening and by swelling; some patients also experience expulsion, and often worms come out of these.
And some of these fistulas often penetrate into the space, penetrating into the bladder and into the meat of the scrotum; and some penetrate into the joint of the thigh and into the knot of the coccyx.
And what is known as a fistula penetrating into the anus and not penetrating, is that you insert your pointed instrument into the anus, and make a small incision in the fistula when there is no hardness.
But if there is hardness in that, then make a small incision with lead or horsehair into the fistula until you feel the incision or the hair in your instrument.
And if you do not feel any of this or do not experience any cause of expulsion, worms, or swelling, as we have said, then you should know that it is non-penetrating and you can proceed with the treatment.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the meat of the scrotum, its meaning is indeed of urine from that place and it should be forbidden until the location has been properly treated with medicine.
If the hernia penetrates into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and pain occurs in the vicinity, this is a sign that it will enter here if there is no treachery inside the bone, and pain in the vicinity of the injured area; that pus will appear quickly; that such treatment has no effect, nor can it be healed with ointment.
In all such fistulas there is not a cure, and the cure of these is the labor and futility of foolish doctors on which they are fixed.
But in one that is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is hoped for as I shall advise you, and what I have tested.
It is that the patient lies between your hands on their back and raises their legs into the air, so that their hips are inclined towards their belly, and carefully insert a probe of lead or of iron if there is treachery in the fistula, until you know where it enters.
And if the patient feels pain around the neck, then you must insert your finger into the neck.
If you feel the probe already penetrating by itself, then what you should do is to insert your finger between the probe and that tissue or flesh, and then you will know with certainty that it is penetrating; and at that point, do not work on it, for there is no healing in that place, as we have said.
But others say that it heals in some men temporarily.
And of the medicine by which healing is hoped for in that place, it is that you ignite a subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been previously described, and insert it into the fistula until it reaches around the neck; then return it two or three times until you know that all the tissues adjusted by the fistula, which resemble the feather of a bird's quill, have been cauterized.
And cure that one with calves wrapped in bandages until they heal all the tissues that are adjusted, and cure that one with medicines that generate and consolidate flesh, and if it is healed, good; and if not, do not attempt healing by another method for a time.
And if the probe is inside, but does not penetrate into your rectum, which is covered with a membrane or with flesh, and sometimes the fistula is in that which dries up the surface of the scrotum, then you should dry the scrotum from the beginning of the fistula, and see if it dries up with the probe, and it should be in the fistula until the drying reaches the location where the tip of the probe emerges, and through the probe is freed and captured.
And cure those fistulated tissues that are similar to the canal of a bird's feather and leave no cause remaining in them.
And if blood flow sometimes comes between you and your action when you handle those tissues, then prepare a poultice and with a light instrument, cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine, for cauterization with fire adjusts good habits: it is the adhesion of those tissues adjusted, and the abscess draining of the blood through drying of the humors.
And cure that one with calves wrapped in bandages or with crushed charcoal until the wound breaks open, and then cure the ulcer with hard-generated flesh ointment.
And these medicines have astringency and drying properties; when it is restored, it is healed and there will be no recurrence.
But if the fistula has already penetrated into the rectum and is elongated from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and investigate with it.
And thus if the probe is covered with flesh or with tissue and is near penetration, then it is not an operation in that place but rather through trust and hope.
The cause is to administer it in one of three ways: either cauterize it as previously described; or to dry it until you achieve the concavity of the place so that it is possible for you to enter and cure it properly without tearing the ligament that contains the rectum, and be careful not to do so much drying that you tear the skin, and it may happen to the patient painlessly, without their will; or to elongate that covering and clean the pus that is dried near the rectum as previously described, either with a probe or another sharp instrument, and to clean those fistulated tissues in the area where you can do percrustation; and to force yourself to restore the entire ulcer through drying, and if the opening of the pus does not consolidate, and the fistula remains open in the lower part of the rectum, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula is finished in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, it is at the side of the rectum near the surface of the body with the scrotum, and on the edge of the rectum, then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is similar to an awl for preparing the body as follows:
And enter into that faithful envelope of your five fields or around them; and carefully enter the fistula, try to reach its cavity until you succeed.
If penetrating into the margin of the anus is done, then you extract the fistula from that hole and insert your finger into the anus; draw out the tip of the fistula and adjust both ends symmetrically, tighten each one, and leave them for a day or two, and when the fistula goes deeper into the flesh, tighten it in as far as those fleshy areas are incised which are between the two ends of the fistula and where they join.
Then heal the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the orifices of the fistula are not penetrating, then you make them penetrate, in whatever way is prepared by you, but it must not be too deep, because it is not for you to do this so as not to injure the lacert; and carefully heal that into which it has been healed.
The method of spine splint for the splitting of the fistula: the curvature of which is sharp and the other end is not sharp, so that it does not penetrate unnecessarily, as sometimes happens.
Stitching hemorrhoids from which blood flows at the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds, for they can be like coal in the anus, or those are like fat from radishes. And those can be small and large, and blood flows from them constantly, and they are single, and they are moist, and they protrude out of the anus, and at their ends.
But those that protrude out of the anus are according to the dry months, from which clear water or a little blood with continuous flow comes, and according to the color of the skin.
And the healing of that which is inside the anus is that you command the patient to sit and express until the anus dries up and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you take hold of it with some tweezers or what you have those with your nail, and carefully cut the roots.
But if the tweezers are not available for those due to their humidity and softening of those, then take those with rough cloth or thread or woolen floss, and draw those out with your fingers, and carefully cut them and sprinkle some powdered herbs appropriate for cauterization at the incision, so that they are in place of cautery; or cauterize those as previously described in the chapter on cauterization. Then heal those with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obstruct evacuation, then cauterize the patient with a small bite in the area of the anus that should be moistened slightly, and the patient should gently press when necessary.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, the cause of them is slight, and you should take those with your nail or tweezers, cut them, and heal them as I said earlier until they are healed.
The one that you should incise, it is necessary to administer stitching of them according to this method: take the fistula and insert the needle into it and carefully draw out the hemorrhoids to the top, and make the needle penetrate through the other part, and envelop the two ends of the fistula on the side further away from the needle, lengthwise; and tie the hemorrhoid tightly, and do not bind the fistula and remove the needle.
And do this for all of them, leaving one loose and not sewing it up, so that the excess blood can flow from it.
Place a cushion on the anus with oil-soaked cotton or wax, and place that over the anus and command the patient to rest. Leave it until it is healed; when it is healed, heal those with salve or the other treatment until they are healed.
And since they are old and of no value in that medicine, it is necessary that you cut those with the point of a splint or your nail until they become moist and are prevented from consolidation; and heal those until they are consolidated.
Then remove those with the most violent reason, before they become dry and are scabbed over; and heal those until they are healed.
Know that anal fistula is essential and not to be ignored regardless of the color of the skin resembling a clove head, it occurs throughout the body but more frequently in the lower parts of the body and the legs, and in these areas pain should be expected.
Then it is necessary to incise what is around the nail and hold it with forceps or tweezers and be rooted out from its root; and heal that.
If you wish, cauterize the following that is preceded in its chapter.
A wart is a small rough, round elevation on the surface of the body, and it is observed in many children.
The treatment for a wart is to extend and incise it, or to press it with a hot iron or with something that goes into the wound. If you want, cauterize this, as I said, with fire or with sharp medicine.
A bedbug is a small rough or large elevation on the surface of the body which moves around in the skin, and when it is touched, it feels like a bite from a bedbug, and it is found all over the body.
The treatment for a bedbug is to take a thin or blunt needle, and it should be strong, and place it on the bedbug inside its circle; then rotate your hand with the needle around the bedbug that you have enclosed within its circumference, and press it in the skin of the body, and eradicate the bedbug from its root.
If you want, do this with an iron rod or with a needle as follows:
The part of the needle above the handle should be thin, blunt (not piercing), wrapped so that when the handle is turned, it moves freely and rotates easily.
If you want to cauterize the bedbug as mentioned in the cauterization of athlete's foot in the chapter of cauteries.
Regarding the tools that are administered for making an incision.
Some veguadas are made with silver or lead or iron that has been melted or hammered; and some veguadas are made of small and large tools depending on the ones that are administered, since the one administered in the treatment of young children should be small; and those for which the ends are sharp or painful, the veguadas of these should be small.
The form of large and shallow incision:
The head of the needle above which the bag is tied should be wide in this manner, and it should have a distinguishing mark where the bag is tied in this way, as is sometimes done.
And the tip of it that is inserted in the anus should be blunt (not open), like a lion's snout, pointed but thin; and on one side there should be two slits, and on the other side one slit, and the width of the slit should correspond to the thickness of the rays, and the larger ones should have a smaller opening.
The bag in which the urinary bladder or sheep's wool medicine is placed should be made of cowhide, and its size should be about a palm.
It should have holes pierced in it as it is rotated, and the size of the space between the holes should correspond to the thickness of a finger.
And insert it into the holes made with a pointed and sharp needle or around them; and adjust the bag to that hole; and when the bag is placed in it, it should be tight at the head of the needle between two distinguishing marks with strong pressure, and then cauterize each hole: However, the quality of cauterizing it is that you fill the bag with medicine, which is heated according to the tolerance of the patient; and make sure it is not too hot or too cold.
Place the patient on his back, and raise his legs and place a cushion under him or a lansol; then anoint the outside of the cautery with oil or albumen of egg or mucilage of fenugreek or similar substances; and insert it gently into the anus with ease, and have someone administer the bag and squeeze it forcefully and repeatedly until everything that is in the cauterizer is evacuated from the intestine; then remove the cauterizer and the patient lowers his legs to the wall.
And if the medicine is not enough in that case, have more of it; and if it remains there for an entire night, it is more beneficial later.
However, if you cauterize it in the cases of abdominal distention and its resolution, then you should continue inserting the cautery until it is healed.
And if in the anus there are hemorrhoids or abscesses that are painful, then use a thin and pointed cautery, such as those that are used for children.
Treatment of sores.
I have already said in the division of treating sores what is necessary for the free treatment, and I say again the treatment of those with more and with medicine according to the need.
Therefore, I say that sores are varied according to what causes the sores and according to the area where the sores occur.
And the causes of sores that are often caused by injuries such as stones, incisions of space or sword, blows with a lance, fist, spear, arrows, or similar things.
These plagues that are in the locations of the body are similar to a plague that settles on the head, neck, feet, belly, back, and are similar to those of the limbs.
And you recommend the treatment of some plagues by following that reasoning and rule for other plagues.
And you begin with the simple plagues of the head, because the composition will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore say that when a simple plague occurs in the head, and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is due to stone or something similar, and the patient has already tightened the bandage only, but there is a large wound and you fear that the patient may develop an abscess, then quickly lance the skull and do not delay; and extract it according to the amount of strength of the blood, unless any other reason prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood that has come out is little.
And ensure that phlebotomy is done opposite the affected side, and protect the patient from replenishment, food, and heavy food.
But if there is any reason for the minucium, then it should be reduced from food and avoid meat and wine.
And pause over the plague, if an abscess has formed, apply oil of roses or wine that is steeped in it.
But if it is certain that there is an abscess, then pause over the plague, if the patient's blood and air have not changed, apply the powder that I will recommend in small amounts.
But if the air has already changed, then pause over some salve until it is healed.
But if the plague is large or due to incision of space and similar things, and the lips are not properly aligned, then align them with suture as I will recommend for their suture.
But if the plague has exposed bone and cartilage without retention, but only a small suspension is used, then incise it and care for the wound with medicines and restore the skin to its place using bandages, and order the patient to eat food that is heavy and nourishing: meat and bread, until it is healed.
If the bandage becomes putrid and does not adhere to the bone, then you should incise it all and drain it, and care for it.
But if in these plagues there is an artery or vein from which blood flow may occur and it has not been separated by medicines, then you should inquire about the artery, and if it is not incised, you should incise it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity compels that what has been said does not conform, then cauterize it until blood flow is stopped.
And if these plagues are simple and small, then their cause is light; therefore you powder over them with this powder, because it solidifies before the air changes those.
And the method of the powder is as follows: prepare an oil made from one part of camphor, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of non-extinct herbs; grind everything together and sieve it, and fill the plague with the powder, and tie it tightly with good binding until it adheres to the skin, and coagulate it with blood.
And keep it above with powder and release it only when it is healed, because the medicine has not yet been absorbed into it until it is healed.
And sometimes perform this caution alone when camphor and dragon's blood are not available to you.
And perform this method of operation on large plagues when it is necessary to pause over them and tighten them, and on new plagues with their blood, which the air has not yet changed.
But if the air has already changed, and especially in summertime, it is not intended to use this powder position, but rather care for them with what has been said, by pausing over them with some salve, or pausing over them with flour water and honey until they drain pus; and care for them with the other treatment until they are healed.
But if a fracture occurs in bone, and it is small, you should extract it with forceps.
I will heal the poisonous fractures of the head.
Of the ailments of the neck.
But if the ailment occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment, and the same medicine applies for the simple fracture of the head.
But if the nerves or artery in the neck have been cut, it is not advisable to treat it immediately with anything that causes violent stitching, such as ziniar and zegi (arsenic and vinegar), which are harmful to nerves and constrict them. And do not apply any ointment to the ailment that causes it to freeze, as the substance of nerves is cold and its continuity is with the brain, which is the most important part of all members.
And if it can be cured with light medicines such as washing it with sweet water, sometimes infused in rose oil or not, thuja (Thuja occidentalis) when washed with sweet water and other herbs mixed according to this method, and gargling with moist liquid.
But if the ailment is large, administer a stitch or sew the lips of it, and apply care with powder until it heals.
But if the ailment has depth or occurs in the lower part of the pustule, then pierce it at its most depressed location.
But if an artery has already been cut in the ailment and bleeding occurs, then separate it, tie it, or cauterize it if necessary.
But if the vertebrae of the cervical spine have already been cut, and the veins of the neck are saved, then you should sew the skin around the cervical spine with sutures on the spinal canal, without touching it; bend it to its natural shape, strengthen it with a suitable structure, and leave it for several days; apply care with astringents to reduce swelling and inflammation until it heals.
If the wound has already penetrated into the bone, then you should percuss it and if there are any fragments of bones, remove all that can be removed; and let what cannot be handled go in so that the wound may heal, and it should be separated and the swelling around it should be alleviated.
And if the wound is fresh, then you should sprinkle that powder which has been recommended over it. But if the wound becomes a fistula, you should treat it with what will come to mind in its appropriate chapter.
If the wound is from a lance or sword, and sometimes of great depth, you should consider whether there is wind coming from the wound if the patient complains about it; in this case, you should know that the wound is fatal.
And if there is no great depth in the wound and it is fresh with blood, you should wait for the first hour before applying powder, and avoid pressing too hard so as not to hold back the blood in the depth of the wound and allow it to return to the heart and alleviate the patient, but apply an attractive ointment to it, and remove it after two days.
And if there is no ointment available, you should wait for the orifice of the wound to become caked with old scab so that it may draw out the humidity; and have the patient sleep on the wound so that it may run what is in it.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound occurred and the patient has not experienced spasm, palpitations of the heart, tremors, or any other good conditions, you should know that the wound is healed; and then treat it with heat and other treatments until it is completely healed.
But if the healing of it is delayed and it is always open, you should know that a fistula has formed; treat it according to its appropriate chapter.
And if the wound is caused by a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, you should treat it with sutures if it is large, or powder if it is small.
But if the wound has already penetrated into the bone and there are separate pieces of bone, you should turn the wound and try to extract those pieces. If the pieces of bone are not separated, you should let them go in so that the wound may heal and the removal of them is alleviated.
And the treatment for other accidental wounds in other parts of the body is the same as that which has been said.
Of abdominal wounds.
The condition of the abdomen that occurs can be large, small, or medium-sized.
Small disruptions are made with difficulty by another means, and it is known that the reduction of them is difficult if you do not take care to insert them into their proper place immediately, for it becomes swollen and thickened, making the insertion of them difficult.
Therefore, the best disruption is medium-sized, because in this case, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is with the two types mentioned above.
You should know that the suturing of the abdomen is done in four ways, but two of these are common and necessary for suturing other wounds on the body.
The remaining two sutures are specific to other wounds, but they are particularly suitable for the suturing of the abdomen.
And I recommend that you have exposure and dissection at your disposal.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and it has caused the intestine to protrude through it, making reduction difficult, you should do one of two things: either because of the smallness of the disruption as mentioned before, or when inflammation has come upon the intestine due to the coldness of the air.
And so when that is the case, you should warm the intestine by placing a sponge or damp cloth in hot water alone, or by putting it in warm water, camphor, cinnamon, and bandages around it to resolve the inflammation.
And sometimes you will find that it has stiffness, and water alone is better for the resolution of inflammation.
And so when inflammation is resolved, you should moisten the intestine with water that contains salt and pepper, as this helps to alleviate the difficulty of insertion.
But if insertion is difficult despite this treatment, you should make a small incision with an instrument and then remove the morbid matter.
The primary treatment is better if it is not dry and there is no need to let it dry out due to necessity or negligence.
Of the instrument, cut its shape:
The first part should be curved and sharp, the second part should not be pointed but rounded, the end should be fine, but not as thin as a needle point, it should be blunt to a small degree.
And since the wound is expanded and the intestine has come out, it is necessary to reduce it in its natural form, in its own proper place if possible, for it is better.
When the injury is widespread and located at the lower abdomen, you must make the patient lie on their back and raise their legs as high as possible; if it is above the abdomen, you must raise the head of the patient and their feet to the same level as the injured area.
If the injury is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, you must immediately focus and decide which side the wound is on so that the other side may be raised higher.
You must also treat large wounds and small wounds.
In small wounds, you should prepare what is needed, and make sure the assistant who will minister to the wound has it ready in your presence, holding the entire wound with their hand and adjusting the edges of it, and then carefully expose one part at a time for suturing, ensuring that no other obstacle interferes.
This is the common suturing method: take a needle or a large needle depending on the size of the wound; position it at the edge of the wound on the anular finger's tip and pull the needle through once, without piercing both ends of the thread, near the inside edges of the skin folds, until it penetrates that area; you have already added two ends of the thread and two ends of the suture, making four orders.
Then pull the thread through twice around the needle, and several times in both areas, and draw together the two edges and the wound by a proper suturing; then position the thickness of the finger and insert another needle into it, pulling it along with the first needle as before; do not stop until you have completed the entire contraction of the wound.
Needles should be neither too thick nor too thin, because thin needles penetrate the flesh lightly; while thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin, therefore it is necessary that they be moderately thin and thick.
The needle should not be inserted too deep into the adjacent skin, so that the flesh is not pierced lightly and the wound does not burst before it heals.
Do not prolong the suturing so that the wound does not hinder healing.
Draw the tips of the needles so as not to hurt the patient during their sleep and place a powder over the suture, covering all areas, which will hold the tips of the needles; leave it in place until you know that the wound has healed.
This method of suturing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, because it covers the suture with only one or two needles around it.
However, the second suturing method is common: you must administer four corners (two from the skin and two from the suture) in one go with a needle that is tightly wrapped in both thinness and thickness.
When the needle penetrates these four corners, retract the needle from that side of the starting area, to draw back the purulent material from the wound to the healthy part, so that the suture is like a sewn fabric where the cloth is strengthened.
Stop between each stitch the thickness of the finger tip.
This suture is known to men.
I sewed the wound that had occurred in a man's abdomen, who had been stabbed with a sword, and the size of the wound was greater than one palm, and it was located near two palms from the belly button of the middle part of the member; and after waiting for 24 hours for the intestine to come out of the wound, I reduced it.
The wound healed in the space of 15 days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he recovered; and he lived for many years and remained in his normal condition.
The other doctors had judged that he would not recover; and by a miracle, because I did not cure him with poultices, because there was no poultice or any medicine in that area, instead I placed cotton on the wound twice a day and washed it repeatedly with honey water until it healed.
However, I will describe two types of suturing as narrated in the word.
You should start with skin suturing, and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And thus, as the needle penetrates through the abdomen and in that place it is placed the thread according to the rule and in length of the entire body, leaving the end of the cipher where the needle was inserted; and make the other end of the needle penetrate from the inner part at the inner end of the hernia to the outer end of the incision on the other side of the midline.
And thus, as you have inserted it there, make it pass again through the other end of the hernia from the inner side to the outer side; and leave the end of the cipher that is in this location, and insert the needle in the other end of the incision from the inner side to the outer side.
Make your insertion pass through the hernia with which you have inserted into the abdomen, until it reaches the other side of the incision.
And bring it together from this side and connect the other end with the one in the abdomen that was penetrated, extract the needle from the hernia that was penetrated, return it to the abdomen, connect the other end of the hernia with the other incision, and remove that one from the abdomen.
Make it pass again and again, and make it pass again and again inside until you sew everything that is on the outside according to this example.
The sum of this suturing method is that you sew with a skin suture, the same one used to sew skins, unless you sew the hernia once from the side of the abdomen incision, and leave the other side open until it is completed.
However, the second type of suturing, which is commonly called Guadia, and this is said because it comes from there and is recommended, is that you sew it according to half-half, as some physicians do, unless all the parts are connected in a natural way; and they apply one end of the other to the other end, and that is done as I have suggested.
You must place the needle at your side of the incision, and make it pass through to the other side only, leaving two ends of the hernia; and turn the needle around and make it pass from outside to inside in the two ends of the hernia.
And turn each of them around, and make each one pass from the inside to the outside in two opposite directions.
And this method of suturing is better than the common light suture, and it is the suturing that precedes remembrance.
This is the Gaulish saying.
However, some say that the abdominal suture is corrected with two needles, so that you insert one needle in each of them and begin with the incision of the needle that is yours, and make it pass to the other side according to the suturing of those who sew the hearts together.
And you should know that when disruption is in the middle of the abdomen, the suture of it is more difficult than those of other parts of the abdomen.
However, the treatment for hernia is judged as that for other hernias.
The cause is that when you succeed in the hernia while it is still fresh before the air changes it, and you reduce the intestine and sew it up properly, then pause over the embrocation powder.
And if the air has already altered the hernia, then pause over some embrocation ointments that are present among you until they become hard and bind the hernia and the incision; and cure it in this way as is the treatment for other hernias until it is healed.
However, if you are not present with the medications, then pause over it immediately, because it begins to bleed, exude pus and change twice a day as you have shown me, until it is healed, for you do not need any other treatment in many cases when hernias are simple.
However, if you fear that the hernia may communicate with damage to the main members, it is necessary for you to immerse linen wool in boiled oil or raw oil, and apply it in the circuit of the areas between the joints and leave it until it cools.
And if there is pain or putrefaction in your hernia, which often goes unnoticed, you must sterilize it with black sticky vinegar, especially if the pus has spread in the hernia and makes an exit by penetrating into its cavity.
And you should know that a large hernia heals more slowly than a small hernia.
And it is difficult to heal because the hernia called "gugunu" does not receive treatment by hernias that occur in other places; and this is due to the large number of veins present there, and the size of it which is larger in them, and the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of it to the nature of nerves.
However, if the process of the hernia is the tissue, and you succeed in it while it is still fresh, reduce it according to your rule, as you reduce other hernias.
If the patient's wound has already turned black or green, then you must apply a strong bandage on the affected area to promote bleeding, as veins and arteries are present in the tissue.
Then, you should cut out a piece of linen equal to the size of the wound, and fold its two ends over the edges of the incision to relieve pressure from the wound, by holding the fabric in place and allowing drainage of the pus.
Remembering abdominal wounds:
When there is a small rupture in the abdomen, it may be possible to restore it in some men, as I once saw one who had been stabbed in the stomach and had an old wound that turned into a fistula, with pus discharge.
Therefore, you should continue the treatment, as it was not yet complete in healing, but rather focusing on sterilizing the inside to promote heat and consolidation of the area.
After the area has been consolidated, you should instruct the patient to avoid any complications from the stomach injury and maintain proper hygiene by eating and drinking well, taking baths, and resting in bed.
Some experienced doctors say that when a small wound occurs in the abdomen, it is necessary to suture it using this method: you should take large breadcrumbs; and then align the edges of the wound and place one breadcrumb with its open mouth over both edges of the wound; when you press on it, remove the breadcrumb's cap, as it adheres and does not dissolve.
Then place another breadcrumb near the first one and do not stop making them, one after the other, according to the size of the entire wound.
Then return the breadcrumbs and sew up the wound; keep the attached caps inside the abdomen until the abdomen is healed, and ensure that no harm comes to the patient.
It is also possible to suture the abdomen with a fine thread made from animal intestines, which is thinner than a needle; you should take the end of this thread of animal intestine and make an incision in it, then sew the end of the thread into the incision using a needle, and reduce the hernia.
This method of suturing with breadcrumbs is not without trust and hope.
If the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the subtle abdomens, then it's not an operation, but rather a delicate procedure that does not heal completely.
Treatment for ulcers and fistulas.
Know that any wound or abscess that becomes old and chronic will turn into an ulcer, not heal properly, and will continue to discharge pus all the time without being drained, and in any part of the body it is universally called a fistula, and we call it a chronic ulcer.
Fistula, in truth, is a hardened, white nodule without pain and with a concavity similar to the concavity of an ulcer, hence it is called a chronic ulcer, meaning ulceration.
And in some men, it is a moist fistula that discharges pus; the moisture is drained after some hours. Sometimes this moisture becomes thin and thick, and is both coarse and fine.
I have already shown all those causes, their signs, and the treatment of them in the division.
Therefore, you must know the treatment for fistulas that are treated by surgical intervention with a scalpel.
And you should know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; those are fistulas that reach veins, arteries, nerves, bladder, abdomen, kidneys, spine, joints such as the hand and foot, or the compound joints like the elbow and shoulder, and they are located near the main limb and similar parts.
Therefore, those fistulas that occur in this way are among the difficult-to-heal diseases and do not receive treatment or care, making them laborious and full of ignorance.
And if it is one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach these places mentioned, and you expect and hope for its healing, and wish to discover its location, then take a probe or iron, and if the fistula follows the right path, probe that with it.
But if the fistula is twisted, then investigate that with a probe of lead, for lead being lighter than its body, it can be moved and curved to follow the twists.
And if the fistula is filled with horrible motions, you cannot probe that with a probe.
Therefore, cauterize the opening with cauteries, for the moisture that you use to cauterize there will run off from other openings and cure them as well.
And approach carefully and examine, by whatever method possible, whether you have a bone or nerve here, and determine whether the fistula is long, deep, or shallow, or is one in which there are horrible motions that lie entirely upon your strength, attention, the patient's weakness, and the discovery of the pain, and you should compress with your hand over the area, as in the case of an abscess.
And when you have considered all those causes with certainty, then proceed to healing according to confidence: for you consider whether the fistula is apparent near salt, far from joints, or nerves, arteries, veins, one of the places that I told you about.
You should dry the fistula as described earlier in its narrative, and remove whatever is in that filtration and rotten flesh, and whatever was born in the sores of the skin or tissue, and treat that within until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of long, deep depth and follows the right path, then it is necessary to incise that in the preon as far as possible, and cleanse it of all its rotten flesh; and administer hot poultices wrapped in medicines, and introduce those into the cavity of the fistula, which you have compressed with iron.
And leave that for some days until the hot poultices in the cavity of the fistula destroy all that is rotten due to corruption.
And place fresh, healthy tissue over it until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by that, then you cauterize it as recommended.
But if the cause of the fistula is a bone and you must certify that, then you investigate that and dry it as recommended, unless you prevent any cause of vein or nerve or major member as mentioned earlier.
But if the bone is exposed and has corruption and blackness there, you remove it until all the corruption is stopped; and treat that with fresh flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and oozes pus as before, then you should know that you have not completely eradicated the corruption; therefore, investigate again carefully and treat the reason for it and cleanse it with the last of your strength, and place fresh tissue over it.
And if it is healed, good; and if not, then you should know that the corruption is deep within the body, which has not been reached, and therefore in that case there is no remedy but to let it be.
And if the rotten bone is small or can be pulled out, then you pull it out with fine forceps suitable for that purpose.
And if it is moving bones, then you extract all of them carefully, and do not leave any cause with your strength.
But if any cause of the moistures opposes you, and there is no fear or error in their incision, then you incise those fluids or flesh if it is here, and deliver the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at your time, then pause over the wound that could become infected, and leave that until the environment of those bones is filled with flesh and fluids, and guard the wound so it does not consolidate, and constrain the incision you made in your operation.
Moreover, if you are afraid, pause over the wound covered in mustard oil, or a wound covered in strong Egyptian ointment, or one of the greenish poultices, for when those liquids boil, the bones will be separated from their abscesses, and the attraction is relieved.
If it is a large bone such as the hip bone or thigh bone, or similar to those, and what is rotten is only its face, then scrape that with resin only backwards until the blackness and corruption is removed, and then restore the wound.
But if what is rotten is a large part of the bone, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it becomes necessary to completely close that area and cut through it into the location where the corruption has been reached, and then treat it until it is healed.
And I recommend to you that which can happen to a man in his thigh, to keep it immobile and supportive during your operation.
Find a young man about 30 years old, in whom pain occurs in the groin, and from within the limbs there is a bad condition on the matter within the body that reaches the groin, and it is matter of an abscess with large abscess, and it is not caused externally.
And therefore it is necessary to wait a long time with that one due to the error of doctors until the abscess has healed, and bring materials for moths, and his healing should be prevented until the hernia becomes fistulized, and make them in the moth-infested holes which all got pus and the humidity of the body.
And then the patient was cured by many doctors for about two years, not with knowledge but with skill, until I was called.
I saw the hernia of him and the matter that ran from those holes through a large opening, and the body of that man was completely stabilized and his color was yellowish.
And then I entered the wound into one of those holes and reached the bone.
And then I quickly examined all the holes and found them coming from all parts of the hernia.
And then I took a scalpel and cut into one of those holes until I discovered a piece of the bone, and found it rotten, muddy and decayed; and already there was a part of the hernia that had penetrated deep into the muscle layer.
And then I carefully removed the rotten and prepared piece of the discovered bone.
And I recognized that it was not in the bone but the corruption that had abscessed and I removed, and I had already drained it.
And then I placed the wound dressing with consolidating medicine for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I continued to probe and discover the bone a second time on the initial discovery, and found continuous corruption in the bone.
And I removed that which appeared from the corruption, and then I was determined to perform the healing and restoration, but it was not restored.
And then I continued to examine it and did not stop cutting the bone little by little particularly and performing the restoration of it, but it was not restored until I cut around one palm-width, and that extracted with the marrow, and then I restored it with medicines, and it healed slightly and became healthy.
There was no need for further examination or cutting of the operation on him and the separation of it except for the care of his weakness and the scarcity of his tolerance and fear of death, because he had happened at all times due to excessive syncopal malfunctions.
And therefore it is healed completely, and nothing remains in the bone tissue; and his condition was good within his body and restored its virtue; and it was preserved in his habits and did not do anything contrary to him in walking or any harm in any cause.
But if the bone is prominent in any part of the body that has been fractured, then it is necessary that you cut it in this way: and it is that you hold it firmly with strong bandages at the end of that prominent bone, and command someone to stretch it; and stop the bandage of wool thicker than the first bandage; and place it on the skin that is left over the bone, and extend the end of it so that the skin is stretched away from the edges, and you cut the skin at the location where you want to cut so that the skin does not get injured.
And place a pillow or table under the bone properly, because when you do that it is not forbidden to use the knife that does not cut the rotten flesh.
It is necessary that the cutting be over the rotten spot little by little, because if it is in the depression of the decayed bone and does not appear in its appearance to the touch, and perhaps it will require another examination.
If the bone is rotten and not prominent, one continuous partition is joined with another, and the corruption is in some places or in parts of it, then you must cut the skin completely; and place a pillow under it, and start cutting from the first partition where the corruption is until the cutting of the second partition is continued.
And the cutting should be small according to the location of the corruption, as previously stated.
If the corruption is at a joint, cut the rotten joint, and cut the bone where it continues with the other part.
If the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not reasonable but cunning.
If corruption is in the chest or foot, it is difficult; however, you must find the corruption in whatever manner it appears to you, and then cut and clean that area as possible according to each disposition available to you, and correct any problem with every device possible, as long as it does not contradict your veins or nerves.
Know what the saws and chisels are for cutting these bones according to their position, and prepare the bones themselves, and their thickness, and their subtlety and greatness and smallness, and their hardness and rarity; therefore, you must prepare all kinds of tools suitable for that operation.
Here comes the next sentence:
Here comes the next sentence: The form of a saw is:
The form of another saw is:
The form of another large saw is:
The form of a rule (ray) is: The end of this rule (ray) should be in the shape of a star head, and the points at the end should be in the shape of the points of an astrolabe.
And it is not advisable unless the joints are compressed when they are corrupted or if the opening is very wide.
The form of smaller knives is:
The form of large blades (lathes) is:
The form of another saw should be made with a curve from the back up to the edge and the sharpness of the blade should descend from the front; the body of the handle should be straightly made. The shape of it is:
The shape of knives with a concavity is:
The shape of other thin knives is:
The shape of another curved-tipped knives is:
Small razor-like shape resembling a tent:
Shape of other small incision instruments:
Shape of another incision instrument; this one resembling a saw and its end has the shape of a saw tooth, and it is used in various places in bone ratios:
Shape of saw suitable for cutting holes in bones:
Triangular end with sharp tip:
Made of Indian steel, and similar to all the causes we have mentioned about razors, incision instruments, and saws:
For incision and bone cutting:
The ends can become inflamed or infected either internally or externally, or if the corruption is not treated with medication and the treatment does not work, or if the corruption spreads to a limb without any apparent cause, then you must incise that limb and cut out the corruption, so the patient can escape death or a worse fate for the affected member.
And the sign of this condition is that the limb becomes black before it can be cauterized with fire, or it may become necrotic (rotten) and spread into the affected member and eventually affect the entire body; therefore, take caution and make an incision in that area.
Similarly, if the corruption is caused by poisonous substances such as those from a sea scorpion, viper, or ratbite and similar animals.
If the corruption or poison is located at the end of a finger, you should incise the finger and not allow the corruption to enter your hand.
And similarly, if you touch the hand, incise the wound at the wrist to prevent the corruption from entering the forearm.
And if it swells, incise the arm at the elbow joint.
And if the corruption spreads and sometimes surrounds the joint, in such a case it is the patient's death; administering another treatment at that point is of little benefit.
When the foot becomes corrupt, cut it into one of the toes.
If there is a swelling on the foot, then you should cut off the whole foot. But if it is a boil inside the nail, then you should cut the nail at its joint.
If corruption has reached the nail, then it is not a matter of treatment but rather letting nature take its course and allowing the patient to die.
The method of cutting a member or sawing it is that you tighten the ligament on the part you want to cut, and tighten another ligament on the other side; extend one ligament at the cut site, and extend the other ligament above; and separate the flesh that is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the flesh is exposed; then separate it by cutting or sawing.
And it must be placed cloth on all cut sites so that it does not touch the wound, and bring the wound dressing for the patient adjusted and cauterized.
But if bleeding occurs while you are working, then you should cauterize the area with caution, or place some stopping powder on the blood; and return to your treatment until it is complete.
Then bind the affected member with cloth as appropriate, and treat that area until it heals.
And I advise you that if a black spot appears on a man's foot, use the remedy that I and you recommend, which is that it should be treated with mustard that is similar to fire burning.
That corruption first appeared in the patient's foot, spreading throughout the whole foot.
Then that man prepared himself by putting on more medicine and going to the affected member with the intensity of pain and burning sensation, and cut off the foot at the joint, and the fire healed it.
For a long time, that same corruption has appeared in the hand as indicated by the master.
Then come to me, and have the excess corruption treated with what can be applied on the hand of medicines, for purification of his body; and do not let the excess spread and begin in another affected area.
And he called me to cut off his hand, but I did not want to do it fearing the spread of that corruption, and rather feared the amputation of his hand as death, for the patient's strength was in the hunt.
And when he lost hope with me, he returned to his land and informed me that the man prepared himself and cut off his whole hand, and it healed.
This narrative has not been added except as a guide for what can be done with this illness, and as a signification that should be understood and followed.
Of cure of the bladder and quality of cleansing with medicine.
If an abscess occurs in any fleshly member and the space of the abscess is prolonged until drainage of pus occurs, and it is broken and perforated, and pus is released from it, leaving a hole like a vessel, and the cloth that is above it is placed like fine fabric, and no further corruption has occurred, and it does not press on the bones or nerves or ligaments, it is called a sinus, and not a fistula.
But if the space is prolonged until corruption enters any member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
The treatment for it is that you cut open the cloth completely as it is rolled up, especially when it is made fine and sewn like fabric, and make sure that it does not adhere to the site due to its corruption.
But if you hope that the cloth adheres and that the corruption has not occurred by further consequences, and in the cloth there is a discharge of pus, then treat it with cleansing.
And consider the sinus and if it is large and the odor is fetid, you should cleanse it with an Egyptian medicine that is made of oil, vinegar, and garlic juice, which are divided into pieces and placed in a vessel, and covered with fire until the medicine becomes red and boils and achieves a specific effect.
And take from it what is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; cleanse the sinus with that, and tighten its opening, and leave the medicine there for two hours.
And remove it with care; do this for several days until the sinus is purified and the foul smell is gone.
And for several days it is cleansed with water of ashes when this medicine is not present; and you take the ash from vegetables, and put it in the water; and boil that and cleanse the sinus with it until you are sure that the sinus has healed.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or water of ash, you should cleanse it with water and honey mixed with garlic juice, and cleanse it with vinegar and honey mixed, because by nature honey purifies and cleanses, and vinegar causes the sinus to adhere, and especially when there is excess stickiness and dryness in the vinegar.
And when you make some observations and confirm that the sinus is flooded, then cleanse it with something that makes the flesh come out of it.
It is that you take defigintic oil or dissolve it with warm olive oil and white powder; or cleanse it with some medications and other remedies that have the properties I have already written about in the treatise on enemas.
If the opening of the sinus is narrow and cannot receive the canula of the enema, then you should gradually widen it with a small tool, and pause in places covered by Egyptian or Basilicon oil until it is fully dilated.
Similarly, if the opening is wide, you should close it with stitches and leave a certain amount of space within the cavity to be filled by the enema.
If the opening from which the arm emerges is raised at the armpit, then you should cauterize it with hot iron in the place where it needs to be lowered so that the arm can return below, because when the arm is constricted in the sinus cavity, flesh will grow there.
If it is not possible to cauterize the sinus near the bone as you wish, then prepare the limb with the preparation required for the arm to emerge easily from it and do not allow anything to obstruct the arm.
However, the one on the sinus opening should always be moistened to allow fluid to escape from the area around the arm. And so that you may know whether what is coming out of the arm is mucus or pus, or undigested matter.
And consider the location of the sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if it is an abscess.
And when your treatment is extended in this manner, and you see the matter discharged from the sinus opening adhering, or bonding, then remove it or wait three days before removing the wound, and when you remove the wound, change the cloth for another and renew the oil.
However, if the sinus cavity is close to having subtle pustules, do not be discouraged by adherence, because healing can occur quickly, for some men have slow wound regeneration, and some have the opposite.
If the sinus cavity is not discharging undigested arm within a few days, then you should know that the sinus is not adhering; and if the adherence of the sinus is delayed, it may be due to excessive addition of ointments such as enguent dyafinicon when it becomes too dry.
And the one that is more recent to be cured is that you take defigintic oil and dissolve it in warm olive oil, and add old remedies known for their antiseptic properties to it, and place it there, and use it.
It is similar in that action when there is no arm, you can use defigintic oil, honey until it thickens, and use it; or you can take myrrh and aloes and crush them into a powder, and sprinkle it over the honey as it cooks, and line the resulting paste on a cloth and apply it to the sinus; and line the paste with the honey that has been cooked until it thickens, and sprinkle it with powder on a cloth and apply it.
And sometimes you can administer it with long aristology and the reason for this heavenly substance (and it is this heavenly substance) and rye flour and centaurea, and use these simple ingredients or combine them, crush them and sieve them, then pulverize the resulting powder over the honey that has been recommended; and hold it.
If the sinus is prolonged and not cured by this treatment, then you should know that the corruption is in the sinus cavity itself, and it is necessary to make an inquiry into the bones or other hard parts of the body; then, you can cure it with fistula treatment, as mentioned above.
Treatment for pancreatic inflammation and finger abrasion, incision, and division of the digit.
Pancreatic inflammation is an abscess that occurs at the end of the finger of the hand or foot, and it can be serious in other cases, and if it is prolonged and its cure is costly, or if it becomes an abscess under an abscess, or is corrupted, it discharges pus into the area around the nail, which eventually corrupts the entire area, and the foul odor spreads to the bone, causing the end of the finger to rot, and the color of the affected area becomes dark.
And so, when you have the one with what I said in the division and do not confirm your treatment, then it is necessary that you cut all the superfluidity that is rotten from the nail and cauterize the place near it, because cautery is helpful in this matter.
But if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, yet the additions of the nail compress the flesh at the joints inside, and they start to hurt and inflame it there, then it is necessary that you make a thin probe and place it at the angle of the nail that pierces the flesh, and push it in with ease, incise the flesh around it, and stop on what remains of the flesh with medicines that burn and corrode until it is all healed; and apply an ointment to it until it is cured.
But if the corruption has already entered into the bone, then it is necessary that you incise the bone there and extract it, for no time will heal what is putrefied in the bone.
If you see the corrosion and corruption spreading in the said joint, then you incise it in one of the nodes according to its memory, and apply medicine to it until it is healed.
But if the nail is driven by percussion or attrition and intense pain occurs there, then it is necessary that you first anesthetize the patient, and then cut the nail with a sharp spatula across transversely from top to bottom, taking care not to cut into the flesh beyond the nail, for you will cause the patient intense pain, and this may lead to the growth of excess skin in that area; and apply medicine to it to relieve the pain.
But the said joint, which is born in the majority of men, has a strong flesh, and it is strong in bone or it is strong in nail.
And these joints are born in the race of the joint, or their nature is in the knuckles of the said ones. But one born in the knuckles of the said does not get sick, and one born with strong joints is malicious.
And of those born with fleshy nature, the incision is easy, and it is that you should make an incision there with a flat spatula.
But of one born with the nature of the joint, the cure is difficult; and so beware of abscessing it.
But in one born with the said knuckles, it is necessary that you incise the flesh of it first with a round incision into the bone, and then saw with a suitable saw, and apply medicine to it until it is healed.
Consolidation that occurs in the said joints between their motions observed or by nature of the man born thus, or by consolidation of ulcers or burns by fire, or by something similar, then it is necessary to cut that consolidation until they return to their natural form.
And place them between their rags in rose oil so that they are not easily consolidated, and separate them, or pause between them a thin sheet of lead until it is consolidated as required.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in the knuckles of the said with the palm, then you cut the consolidation according to its preparation and the shape of the member.
Of incision of vices, they are varicose veins.
Varicose veins are varices, and they are swollen thick veins full of melancholic superfluidity that move in the members of the body, and the greatest danger of them is in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and workers and carriers.
Therefore, it is necessary that you administer purge of the body of black bile several times with strong evacuation, and apply bloodletting on the patient from the basilic vein.
The cure of them with iron is according to two methods: the first is that it should be incised and drawn out the black blood, and the second method is that it should be elevated and all should be extracted.
The incision of it is according to this method: first, the leg is encircled with hot water not too deep until the thick blood is resolved, which is feculent from the leg, and then the patient's thigh is strapped above the most superior part of the hip joint to the part below the knee with a bandage, and it is cut in one place, or two, or three with wide incision, and it raises the black blood with the thumb of the part below the leg upward and downward until the amount you want and what you have removed is released, and this will take away the power of the patient.
Approach her (the patient) and order her to abstain from consuming black bile-inducing foods.
Repeat the treatment by leeching when the veins are filled and the patient feels pain.
The elevation of them (the legs) is done in this manner: you who are raising the patient's bed, if there are swellings in it, approach him with warm bath and wrap his leg in hot water until it softens and veins become engorged; or, if bathing is not available to you at present, apply strong exercise until the member becomes warm.
Approach the affected area along the vein and make an incision in length or obliquely (across) depending on whether it is towards the thigh or the foot you must cut, or at the bottom of it, you must cut the tendon.
Approach the affected area with an open incision and remove the vein from all parts until it becomes visible, and you must identify that part which, when pressed, darkens (turns black).
Therefore, cut out the white, stringy substance from the affected area.
Approach and place a ray under it (the stringy substance) until it is raised and separated from the affected area, and suspend it with a hook of lion's beak.
Approach another incision near the first one (the previous incision) for three fingers and remove the affected area above the vein until it becomes visible.
Approach and raise that (the stringy substance) and incise it in the posterior incision towards the tendon, and remove it and raise it through the second incision until it exits, and remove it from the incision above it (the previous incision).
Do this until the stringy substance is completely removed from all incisions and exits, then make another incision in that area.
If you find it difficult to extract and raise (the stringy substance), then insert a strong double-pointed needle and tie it off and remove it, or place a hook under it and rotate your hand around until it is separated. Be careful not to cut yourself during the procedure, for if it is torn, it will be difficult to lift (the stringy substance) and may cause harm to the patient.
When the stringy substance has completely been removed, place your hand over the area of the wound filled with wool soaked in vinegar and oil (both roasted and unroasted), and treat it until it is healed.
If the vein is constricted by twisting and not straight as I have said, then it is necessary for you to cut along all parts of the twist and at the points of the twist, and suspend it with a hook until you raise it completely.
Be careful not to cut the vein during your incision and not to harm it, for it will be difficult to lift (the stringy substance); use your prudence in this matter.
The shape of the incision made on the constricted vein:
It should not be made as with hooks or of sharp point so as not to harm the vein; it should be large and flexible, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein due to its thinness; it is unnecessarily thick as I have said.
Extraction of leg veins.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot countries such as Al-Andalus (Arabic lands) and India, in arid regions with little vegetation and where there is neither grass nor herbs.
It is also generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
The growth of it (the stringy substance) is due to putrefaction which comes from the affected area such as venom within the body, snakes, worms and parasites generating between the affected area and the flesh.
The sign of the onset of this condition is the swelling in the affected area, and the area becomes inflamed; the vein begins to seep from the site of that inflammation which resembles a plant (or plant growth).
Therefore, when the limb appears to be rotten, you must cover it with a lead weight of approximately two dragons' weight and submerge it, then leave the lead suspended from the bed.
Stay watchful for any changes in the surrounding tissues during this period and cover it with lead again if necessary. If the condition persists, you must make an incision in it and cover the remaining part with a piece of cloth; do not cut into the surrounding tissue until it has completely emerged from the wound, for if you cut it, it will be constricted and enter the flesh, causing abscesses, pus, and bad ulcers at that site.
Because it must be treated gently and gradually extracted little by little, until it is completely expelled from the body and there remains no cause within the body.
From this vein, it has issued in some men whose length is approximately 5 palms and of this I have already heard that one measures up to 20 palms.
If it is cut during the time of treatment, insert a probe into its wound and perforate it with a long probe to the body, until everything in the matter is evacuated, and administer putrefaction to the area for several days with medicines; then care for it through the healing of ulcers.
This vein sometimes produces worms, and more often when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and it produces many horrific exits, and it is expelled from each exit as worms.
Therefore, treat it in this way as we have said in the division and with what has been mentioned above.
From the cut on worms generated under the skin and it is called bovine disease.
This disease is called bovine disease in some lands because it often affects cows and the worm is relatively small which is born between the hide and the flesh, and moves up and down throughout the body and is manifested through the sensation of the limbs one by one until it bursts the skin and comes out.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors such as worms, snakes, worms, and roundworms in the abdomen.
And it is feared due to its malice, because when it moves through the body and reaches the head, it is passed through the nose, causing strong nausea in it and entering and destroying the brain, and many times it does so.
And therefore when you want to cure it and extract it, do not proceed unless you have its walking and appearance at the sensation, and then it is necessary that you strengthen what is over it and what is below it with medicine and strong constriction, and apply dryness on it and remove it.
And if it is attached to the flesh and does not burst, then you stop cauterizing fire on the spot until it dies, and the main cause that is feared is corruption of it with which it corrupts the area as we have said.
If you see that being passed through the nose near the nose, strengthen above the eyebrow with strong constriction and apply dryness on it, and remove it; and the patient must use cleansing of their body with medicines evacuating bad humors and guard themselves from foods generating putrefaction.
From the cut on illness of the nose.
This disease is called naris in our land, and it is pain that occurs in some members, and moreover, it is confined to member after member.
And I have already seen that as I advised you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and discovered her arm and saw a small inflammation on the brachial vein of the arm, which had been torn apart for an hour, and then I saw that inflammation rise up like a worm moving towards this location, but more slowly than usual, as if it were alive when it moved from place to place.
And then the pain of that location settled in the muscle and stayed there for an hour.
Then it moved to the other side of the body until it reached the other arm.
And I advised her to turn herself over her entire body as I saw; and it was very marveled at the change of it and the speed of member after member. And I had already seen something similar in the upper nostrils in that manner, but I have seen many which turn pain to be transferred from member to member. But not with the nose as in the woman.
And I did not think that it was this because the woman was old, where the body and veins are dry, and in this case, the sensation of windiness is transferred.
And it is necessary that it does not appear in this way in those who are pleasurable and have humid bodies with weakened veins.
And as you want to cure it, and the patient feels that pain, do not show yourself at the nose as we have said, but strengthen it and leave it slightly and dry it until that windiness is expelled constricted, and cauterize the spot.
But if you do not see it with your nostrils, then you cure it with evacuation of the body and with what expels windiness, and treat it with pills made of fumitory and pills of serapion and similar ones.
From extraction of teeth.
Teeth are various according to the species, and depending on the places in the body where they grow, because their diversity is that of those with large points, small ones, concave ones, serrated ones, which are solid; and from those with three corners, and from those to which tongues belong; and from those that are teeth.
And the signs of a stab wound are when an arrow passes through bone and pierces the skull which is above the brain, for this happens suddenly with vehement swelling, blindness, dizziness, fever in the head, inflammation and fever of the tongue, spasms and confusion of thought, vomiting of bile, and the word is quickly separated and destroyed and the voice is lost. And there is exuded from the wound place moisture like white powder resembling pus, and eyes from it similar to watery flesh.
Therefore, if these signs appear to you, then you should abstain from cure and extraction of the arrowhead unless it is necessary.
However, the signs of an arrowhead in the heart, which is close to the left breast, are such that it feels like something hard has been inserted and not empty. The movement of the arrowhead is similar to that of a pulse, and bleeding from the wound is black, and there is cooling at the extremities, sweating, and fainting. And therefore, you should know that death approaches quickly.
And the signs when the arrowhead has wounded the lung are immediately of spumy blood from the wound and the vessels near the neck are disturbed, and the patient's color is changed, and he exhales a great spirit and asks for cold air.
And if the arrowhead pierces the membrane that is in the foot, and pain follows which is similar to minor ribs, and makes a great and violent pain and sigh, but not all the limbs of the muscles are affected.
And if the arrowhead pierces the stomach, there will be a strong smell coming from the wound of some indigestible.
And if the arrowhead pierces the abdomen and is lodged in it, there is a fissure or tear of the wound, or tissue, or hernia that has been disrupted, and there is no hope for recovery through extraction of the arrowhead.
And if the arrowhead pierces the bladder and is discharged outward through urine, and some cause comes to the parts outside, and there is strong pain over the patient, then you should know that it is fatal.
However, the other members such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders and buttocks, spine, neckbone, pelvis and their similar in members are saved according to the greatest dispositions when the arrowhead does not strike a vein or artery and is not poisonous arrowhead.
I recommend this to you that I have seen of these arrows, which means by this on self-treatment.
The cause is that in a man an arrow pierces the tear duct of the eye at the root of the nose, and I extracted it from the other side, leaving the hairs of the eyelash, and healed, and no harm came to the eye.
I extracted another arrow from a Jew that had pierced him in the eye at the root of his eyelid, leaving only the palpebra behind, and the arrow was already hidden and could not be obtained except for a small tip attached to its shaft, and it was a sharp arrow of the Turks with a lion head without eyelashes.
The Jew sentenced it, and no harm came to his eye by this.
I extracted another arrow from a Christian man who had been pierced in the throat, and it was an Arabic arrow with eyelashes; and then I incised it between two tendons, and it was already submerged in the throat of the man; and then I softened it with that, and then I carefully extracted it, and the Christian healed.
I extracted another arrow from a man who had been pierced in the stomach, and I thought he would die by it; but since thirty days passed and there was no change in his condition due to any of his dispositions, I incised it and cauterized it, and he healed, and no harm came to him.
I saw another man in whom an arrow had pierced his back, and the wound was healed over it, and after six years, the arrowhead emerged from the root of the buttock.
I saw a woman in whom an arrow pierced her stomach, and the wound was healed within it, and there was no change in her condition after three years, and the woman suffered no harm in any of her natural operations.
I saw another man in whom an arrow pierced his face, and the wound healed and the arrow was extracted without causing great pain, and it had similar symptoms.
Extract the splinter from the man's nose located in the middle, which had fallen and declined towards the right side slightly, and it was entirely hidden.
It was called to treat him approximately three days after the splintering incident.
Here is the translation for the given sentence:
Spread the area with a plaster containing astringent and digestive properties, so that it may adhere to the wound site, revealing where the splinter is located, and cutting through it.
Do not be concerned if the splinter has reached an insignificant location; continue applying the plaster to it for many days, and do not be alarmed about any accidents; as the wound heals, the patient will feel relief from the splinter's extraction within several days, and then report this to me.
Then place an acute and corrosive medicine on the wound for many days until pus appears, and with the probe, I will search for the splinter's end that adheres to the shaft.
Ensure that the wound opening is adjusted with the application of the acute medicine until I can see clearly the splinter's end; and in the meantime, report to me any changes within four months.
Ensure that the wound expands, and it becomes possible for me to insert forceps into it; secure them, and do not remove them immediately. Then, continue to search and manipulate it with various tools until one day, using forceps specifically made for this purpose, grasp it firmly, as its form will be revealed in the end of the chapter, until you extract it; and then restore the wound.
And some doctors believed that the nose cartilage was not restored, and I will restore it, and the wound heals, and the patient recovers fully, with no recurrence of issues in him.
I recommend the quality of splinter extraction for which you will note rules and significances concerning what I have not mentioned, since the sections and definitions of this art are not easily understood through narrative or free translation.
The wise craftsmen compare much with little, and based on the present state, they infer about the absent one, and they find new operations and innovative tools when dealing with unusual causes in this art.
Therefore, I say that splinters are not lost from the members in which they are embedded except through two ways: either by attraction towards the location where it entered, or conversely, by moving away from the opposite side.
The splinter that is lost by the location where it entered, or it is a splinter originating from a meaty place and thrown out.
If you do not remove it immediately after catching, then you should leave it for several days until the surrounding flesh can be cut and the attraction and exit of the splinter is relieved.
Similarly, if it is embedded in bone and you do not remove it immediately, then leave it for several days and apply pressure and movement to it daily, and it will be expelled.
If you do not remove it immediately, then you should wait for several days and perforate the circuit of the splinter in every direction with a small needle around the entire area until the space is widened by the splinter, and then extract it.
But if the splinter is hidden in the chest area and it is not felt, then you should probe it with a probe, and if you feel it, you should draw it out using appropriate tools suitable for pulling it out.
And if you cannot approach the wound due to the constriction of the ulcer and the length of the bone, and it is neither bone nor nerve nor vein there, then you shall make an incision into the ulcer until it is expanded and extractable.
If the ulcer is walled in, you shall deliver the flesh in which it is embedded from all sides with all the skill you can muster; and if you cannot approach the exit of the flesh due to the fracture of the walls and their twisting into each other until it becomes necessary.
And when you administer the removal of the needle in any location where it is, you shall use a twist with your hand and forceps on all sides until it yields; and gently but subtly so as not to break the needle, making its withdrawal difficult for you and that extraction.
And if you cannot approach it at that time, leave it for several days until the surrounding parts have healed, and then return to it when it has been relieved. However, if there is counterflow of blood, you shall administer what has been said about the cure in its own chapter.
And guard your skill in the incision of vein or nerve, or cord, and administer all methods possible for the removal of the needle; do so with ease, tranquility, patience, and firmness as I and you recommend.
Therefore, counter the needle in such a way that the patient's condition is as much like the figure in which you must extract the needle, because it is more beneficial. But if that is not within your capabilities, administer what is within your abilities according to the figures.
But the needles that are extruded in opposition to the other side or have already caused some damage to the surrounding parts, or cause the extramural area of the needle to be palpable due to the part above the proper cavity and sometimes prominently; then you shall incise over it; and make the incision according to the size in which forceps can grasp it; and place your hand over it, because it will come out easily.
But if it is retained in the bone, you shall twist the knife against the needle until it enters the bone, and widen the incision made, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for several days, and then return to it until it comes out.
And if the needle's shaft is there, you shall push it with it.
But if the shaft is cut and you wish to administer a push, insert your finger into it, if it is hollow, stir it concave so that it enters the concavity of the needle and then push it with it.
But if the needle is concave, you shall push it forcefully with a strong instrument into it, because the needle will be relieved by that.
And if the needle is entrapped, you shall make sure that you concave all the flesh surrounding it, if you can do so, and then cure it with what is appropriate for its condition.
And if the needle is lodged in the foot, or stomach, bladder, ribs, and is close enough that you can touch it with your fingers, and it is possible to incise over it, then incise over it, guarding against the incision of vein or nerve, extract it, sew up the wound if necessary, and cure it until it has healed.
The shape of the forceps for extracting needles is:
Its tips are shaped like bird's beaks that are made with scissors to grasp the needle without leaving it.
And from these are made small, large, few or medium-sized motes, according to the size and thickness of the needle and the size of the wound and constriction of it.
Like a reed to relieve the intestine in the curved indentation and press it with that.
Of vein-cutting (phlebotomy).
The veins for phlebotomy, of which it is customary to cut thirty. in the head there are sixteen. two pulsating veins are near the ears, called the superiors; two herbs that are in the temples and appear evident; two veins that are in the tear ducts of the two eyes called the lacrimal veins; and one prepared vein at the middle of the forehead, and the vein at the tip of the nose; two veins near the neck; two veins near the upper lip; two veins near the lower lip; these are the veins that are called the palmar veins; and two veins behind the tongue. However, the veins that are cut in the arms are five. for one of those is the cephalic, and it is necessary to let it lie quiet; the people call it ‚Äúthe vein of the head,‚Äù and it is superficial, and it is a median vein, and it consists of one branch from the basilica, and another branch from the cephalic; and the people call that one ‚Äúthe vein of the whole body,‚Äù and basilica is the vein which is paused in the domestic artery, and it is called ‚Äúcubital,‚Äù and common people call it ‚Äúthe vein of the abdomen‚Äù; the median cubital vein, which passes through the wrist, and is the one that is cut, and it appears above the point manifestly; and the cephalic vein, which is between the mentioned auricular (?) and the smallest finger, and there are two branches of it.
And in the foot and calf there are three veins: one of those is located below the curve of the domestic artery, and the second is popliteal, and its location is below the calf of the domestic artery; and sciatic, and its location is below the calf of the wild artery; and in the calf there are other veins similar to those.
The benefit of the veins near the ears is for old catarrhs, migraines, and headaches (or scalp diseases) that are ancient.
And the quality of bleeding those veins is according to what I recommend to you: it should be shaved the patient's head, and the patient's head should be washed in the occipital area near both veins with a large, clean cloth; place the patient's neck strongly with a bandage that covers their ears and the locations of the veins are near the ears in two places pressed on the patient's head; and you shall take that with your fingers, and if you feel the pulse of those veins with your fingers, here is the test.
Take the surgical lancet and the one that is pointed, and insert it below the vein into the cavity until bloodletting comes out to the bone. And raise your hand over the vein and cavity above it, and insert the incision in the vein with an incising instrument. And let the length of the incision be the width of two fingers or close to that amount; and make the blood flow out as much as you want.
And press firmly on the pulse and let it stop bleeding until it heals.
And at the beginning of the book, the incision and its cauterization have already been discussed.
Modern translation: Among the two arteries that are at the temples, their assistance in phlebotomy is an ancient and harmful emigration and persistent otology and a course of acute fluid overflow to the eyes.
Modern translation: And the quality of phlebotomy in that case, as I recommend to you, is to have the patient lower their head until both arteries appear for clear perception and demonstrate the pulses below them after your word; then you shall make an incision.
Modern translation: Then raise the bandage above the vein at the elbows, and indicate with your words where to make the phlebotomy incision, then insert the lancet and lift the vein upwards; and make an incision in this manner as you have done in other veins; and let the blood flow according to the quantity of your need.
Modern translation: Then unfasten the patient's bandage and place your hand on the vein for an hour, and also place your hand over that area and press it firmly, and keep it in place with strong compression until it heals.
Modern translation: And now, the preparation of them (the veins) has been described, as well as the incision and attraction at the beginning of this treatise.
Modern translation: And thus, the phlebotomy of the frontal vein is similar to the phlebotomy of the superficial temporal vein for ancient facial maladies like emigration and inflammation and putrid ulcers.
Modern translation: And the quality of phlebotomy in this case is as I recommend to you, that is, the patient should lower their head with a bandage until the vein appears; then take the instrument called the lancet, which has this shape.
Modern translation: Place the puncture in the prominent end of the lancet on that vein and pierce it with a sharp blow or another cause in its manner, and let the blood flow according to the quantity you desire; then unfasten the perforation of the patient and keep it compressed until it heals.
Modern translation: Sometimes a vein is opened with phlebotomy on the side, but it should not be done with an acute angle as in other phlebotomies, rather it should be done obliquely, because the bone is close and strong, and the phlebotomy would easily break if it is thin.
Modern translation: Among the two veins that are at the eyes of both eyelids for scabies of the eyelids due to inflammation and sores in the eyelids, and facial maladies.
Modern translation: And the quality of phlebotomy is that the patient should lower their head with a bandage, and you make the phlebotomies, while standing above them.
Modern translation: Make the phlebotomy obliquely along the transverse direction, with a slight long axis and perform few phlebotomies, because in that area there is not much flesh; if the phlebotomy is thin, then break its extremity.
Modern translation: Let the blood flow as needed, and then place your hand over that area and press it firmly for a new day, and unfasten them (the phlebotomies).
Modern translation: The phlebotomy of the nasal vein is given for acute fever and violent swelling, and facial maladies such as emigration and inflammation that occur in the face, especially when it is old.
Modern translation: And the quality of phlebotomy in this case is that the patient should lower their head and place your left hand on their nose, and take the thin and long lancet, and place it in the middle of the nasal cavity according to rectitude, because the vein does not appear for perception here, and blood begins to flow immediately.
Modern translation: It is necessary that you complete the phlebotomy slowly with your hand and let the blood flow according to your need; and hold it for a night, because it heals easily.
Modern translation: The phlebotomy of the two guiding veins is given for constipation, the beginning of leprosy, and many other diseases and impetigo, as well as corrosive ulcers like scrofula.
Modern translation: And the quality of phlebotomy in these cases is that the patient should lower each one in their head gently; and the operator stands over the patient's head, while the patient lies on a chair.
Modern translation: And make the phlebotomy along the long vein with a wide and shallow lancet, and draw blood according to a measured quantity or as needed at that time; and make it similar to the other vein.
Modern translation: And unfasten the bandages and compress the two veins gently with moderate compression to prevent the patient from being agitated, and let it rest until morning as the wound heals.
Modern translation: The phlebotomy of the marginal veins is given for small abscesses and pustules in the mouth, decay of the gums, corrosive ulcers, and malformations, as well as malformations that are at the nose and around it.
Modern translation: And the quality of phlebotomy in these cases is to have the patient lie down before you, and lower their head with a bandage, and then roll back the lips, and observe two veins of which one is on the right lip and the other on the left; and the demonstration of each one is by the darkness of each one, and this is more noticeable because in the circuit of these veins there are many small black veins; and therefore make an incision for each one with an oblique incision.
If you doubt which one it is, and do not know which of those, then you should open the incision of the largest one, and the most obvious one of those.
Make it appear as if the two veins are in the lips above [the area].
Of the two veins that are below the tongue, it is more advantageous for the carotid artery puncture in the neck to be performed at the hyoid bone, throat disease, and oral diseases.
The quality of puncturing those is that it follows the patient's pulse just below the throat, lifts the tongue, looks down at the tongue, from one side of the vein and the other side of the vein, and the color of each one is darkening.
Therefore, puncture each one; and be careful not to injure your hand in puncturing those, because they are arteries below those.
Your veins that are punctured in the coyde are those that it is customary in all men, and the puncture of them is done according to two methods, or they put [something] mirtilat or olive oil at a subtle decline; or they cut with a scalpel, and call it anessil, and this is the method of it:
It should be like that, sometimes, and it is necessary to open the veins concave full of apparent thick blood, and those that contain thick clotted blood.
This puncture is smaller and of more subtle termination, and it is necessary for the puncture of fine veins that contain thin citrus blood.
The advantage of the puncture of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is that it drains the blood from diseases below the throat and neck, and from what soaks the legs and abdomen.
It is necessary for the person performing the puncture to be careful when puncturing it, as there is an artery below it, and if he misses the mark in the puncture of the puncture, he will cut that artery and cause bleeding, so it is necessary not to puncture it with a sharp needle but to cut it with scissors.
And if the basilica does not appear by a clear manifestation, it is necessary that you search for another branch or seek a vein ramification; or puncture in the location of the end of the arm, as that one appears clearly; and cut it with scissors as we have said.
But if you want to puncture the metacarpus, it is necessary in front of the arm's stricture that you touch the place inside known as the wrist, and apply heat over it; and approach the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision with scissors as we have said; and be careful not to injure the percussion near the location of the artery.
And when you feel, as the lymph swells, inflammation in the place that you have heated, that inflammation is of the artery, and therefore it should be avoided.
And if the blood flows in the puncture like that of a child's urine, and the blood is thin red, you know that it is arterial blood; and then you should tighten and stop your finger over that area for a long period of time; and remove your finger, and if the blood is cut off, because after many observations it is cut off, you should tighten the arm and let it rest.
Keep the patient away from their urine, be wary of them and do not let anyone approach them for several days until they are healed.
If the abscess does not burst, and you do not need to provide medical care for them, then you must incise the artery if it appears; because the extremity becomes contracted, and the blood is absorbed; or take scissors and open that, and take a ligature and tighten it over the location of the vein with constriction downwards and with powder and pills into the other day.
If the abscess has burst, that is good; otherwise, you should treat it with the remedy prescribed before remembering the location of the powders for draining blood.
The drainage of the abscess is difficult due to the small size of the wound and the possibility of ligature on the arm.
However, the lumbar vein puncture is beneficial for draining blood from the subclavian part of the neck and the area below the chest; because it consists of branches of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we said before.
The person performing the puncture must be careful in the lumbar puncture because it is located near a nerve; therefore, if you adjust incorrectly during the puncture and injure the nerve, it will result in paralysis, making healing difficult, and recovery will not be complete. This nerve can often be observed by sensation; however, if it is hidden in some individuals and is subtle and not visible, then you must stop the lumbar puncture with the incision made at the incisura alnisili, and avoid injuring the nerve with your strength.
If the vein is between two nerves, then you must puncture it lengthwise.
The advantage of the cephalic vein puncture is that it drains blood from the head and helps with headache patients.
Therefore, in this particular case, if you want the puncture to be made with an olive or a myrtle syringe, because it is safe for all veins, as there is neither artery nor nerve present nearby.
However, it is important to note that in some cases, an abscess may develop if the puncture is not done in the initial percussion, but this should not be confused with an abscess.
The first point to consider is that puncture should only be administered for the preservation of health and with hope for recovery and caution against complications of illness; it should be done in one of the veins that are on the arm, namely: cephalic, lumbar, and basilic; it should be done at the beginning of spring, during fasting in spring and autumn, and in winter near meals when signs of congestion appear.
The puncture should be performed on the third day or at least one day after three hours have passed since meals.
Puncture is administered when it is appropriate and necessary; either at night or during the day, at any time and in all circumstances.
It is necessary that children under the age of twelve are not punctured; women should not be punctured before their fourth month or after their seventh, and the elderly should not be punctured if they are over sixty years old.
If someone wants to be punctured in some way, it is necessary to clean the intestines before the puncture with a lion-based clyster, if there is any fissure retained, to prevent superfluous fluid from entering the puncture of the intestine, which are pure, and not affecting the main members.
Puncture should not be performed on patients with nausea or vomiting, nor those suffering from illness or drunkenness until their condition has improved; nor should it be performed on a patient with edema; however, puncture is to be feared in the case of colic pain, vomiting, abdominal conditions, increased coitus and work, and exercise of fasting or vigils, and any cause that dissolves virtue, whether corporeal or animal.
Also consider the condition of the humors before puncture if the blood is thick; with food and drink, and medications if they are possible for that patient.
Bathe the patient if there is no contraindication, or exercise them with some exercises to thin the blood.
Puncture should be stopped on the feet during the day, around three o'clock, as we said before.
Therefore, make sure the feet of that patient are kept away from all animal and physical conditions such as anxiety, anger, fear, labor, excess work, coitus, and similar conditions during that day.
And at the patient's bedside, let the causes be present for use in accordance with the custom of men who have aromatics, perfumes, balms and similar things in as much quantity as possible.
And follow the lancet on a finger that is swollen or the finger of the one who should be lanced.
Then move the arm towards you and press it with your hand using the lancet two or three times; then tighten the bandage with a strap and wrap it twice.
If the constriction is too tight, since it should not be constricted or if there is superfluidity, then prevent fluid from flowing out; or if it is for softening, then prevent the outflow of blood.
Then approach the constriction, and have the one who should be lanced press his own mass between where the veins are inflamed and palpable.
Then apply the lancet to the lancing site with a little antiseptic oil specifically; then pause your left hand over that vein, at the location where the lancing is desired, so that the vein oozes a little and the percussion is softened, since when the veins are contracted like cords, you should lance there, and in those that are full of turbulence, you should press the lancing site, and if the lancing pierces the vein, it is too tight.
And therefore, for these reasons, the lancet should be firmly held and carefully applied to all these causes.
And then pause the lancing, but if the vein is pierced in one stroke, that is good; and if not, you should try another stroke at that location a little later, or in haste if the location is not apparent.
And if the location is apparent, or the patient feels fearful, you should leave it for a day or two and not tighten the bandage, since a strong pressure will cause an abscess to grow, nor enter it into baths.
And then repeat the lancing if necessary.
And if the incision is small and the blood flows thinly, and you fear that there will not be enough blood, then repeat the lancing in that area according to rules and adjust the opening slightly, and do so quickly before the location becomes an abscess, since in most people a small incision should be made.
But if it has become an abscess, do not repeat the lancing there, since you have no excuse for this; and pause on some part of the oil opening, since it relieves the flow of blood. And it is better at that location to use oil and other oils.
Similar treatment is administered by making an oil incision in every lancing of veins where the prohibition of blood flow is necessary, and do so according to Tyrian acupuncture and Hippocratic wisdom when one of those is paused over the location, since the blood becomes thin and turns around when it is thick.
If a large abscess is formed at the lancing location, which often happens, especially in those who are not bled that stroke or in the incision of the vein that is too small, then you should cauterize it and apply a sponge soaked in infused water and salt, slightly scalded, and hold it for an hour, since it dissolves.
It is necessary to do this with the blood of that vein and completion of it or another vein.
If it remains in the location for several days with any blackness or greenness, do not notice it; and if you wish, pause on some cause of aloe and myrrh dissolved, or some cause of mint juice or calamine or something similar to it.
Often abscesses and swellings require lancing from the basilica.
And therefore place your hand on it, and if you find that it is softening, then apply pressure on it, which means the swelling is bad and harmful; and so beware that you pause on some cause of what has been said, since strong blood will flow from the artery.
Apply plasters with what is hardening to make the location tougher, and treat it with the other treatment until it heals.
It is necessary to draw blood from every person according to the quantity of its virtue and according to the type of blood that appears.
Since if the blood is black, you should allow it to flow out until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thick, you should allow it to flow out until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, you should leave the sharpness until its sharpness has passed.
It is necessary for a person who is full and strong and has the necessity of bloodletting in one stroke, that the incision of the vein should be expanded and the lancing should be large.
In a weak person, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to draw blood in many strokes, and the incision should be small.
The best method for vein lancing is a transverse section, not puncture.
This method of lancing abscess is safe from blood flow and the incision of nerves, and it is praised and considered safe that lancing according to latitude and longitude.
When fainting often occurs during the process of lancing, it is necessary to treat that person before lancing with a piece of bread infused in vinegar of milk thistle or simple scalded oil; and draw out the pus from it in three or four views.
If there is swelling of the complexion, then take before lancing a mixture infused in myrrh syrup or honey scented with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar ones, or scented and fragrant oil.
If fainting occurs during the process of lancing and it is only due to blood, then it is necessary to take water of meat and subtle fragrant oil to drink; and use aromatics, and bind his feet with that.
Use the other causes mentioned in the chapter on fainting for evacuation.
Whoever wants to drain his arm and dissolve the blood gradually according to viewing, it is necessary for the person in whom lancing is for great evacuation, and the effect of it is freul, which drains the blood little by little, is as such according to the amount of the power each day.
But whoever wants to drain his arm and expel the blood at certain intervals, and his body is strong, then do this after seven or nine hours from the first lancing.
But whoever wants to draw blood from the body contrary to its flow towards the affected area, it is necessary that this be done on the second or third day.
But in a body in which blood is already heated and sharpened and causes fever, it is necessary to expel the blood from that one in one view and draw out a large amount of blood and increase the opening until fainting occurs, because you will have preserved all the conditions for lancing; and place your hand over the pulse of the affected area, so as not to let death occur in the place of fainting, for many views can endanger that when the lancer is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not necessary that when you want to drain the arm and expel the blood at intervals, as if the openings of the vein are closed and it is difficult to extract the blood in general, that you press hard on that with violence and extend it slightly, because that is harmful.
If you wait until the arm is to be lanced again; or reinforce the effect of lancing by coagulating the blood in the vein openings; or rest on tarred alum, or with sage, and compress it lightly until the blood comes out.
If the vein is inflamed, then leave that one alone and do not touch it until the inflammation has subsided.
And if there is a need to drain the blood again and it is not an excuse, then you should lance that one over that area or in the other arm in another vein.
The vein called the "sinew of the arm" is lanced in the area of the cuff or the basilic, if they are not contracted or swollen, because it consists of those.
The quality of the lancing is that the patient inserts his hand into hot water until the needle becomes noticeable and the vein appears.
Then bind it firmly with a narrow bandage; and lance the transverse way, not longitudinally or along the length.
And make the opening large and your lancing with which you lance that one over the joint of the hand slightly.
And if the flow of blood is forbidden, then you immerse your hand in hot water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your goal.
But if you are in the summer days, you are exempt from immersing your hand in hot water, and it is forbidden to warm the body with hot water in winter times.
Lancing of this vein is safer than that of all other veins, as there is neither a pulsating vein nor nerves there.
Lancing of the wrist on the right hand is suitable for liver diseases.
The quality of the lancing is that you bind the hand firmly with a narrow bandage, as you place it in hot water, until the vein is inflamed and clearly visible to the eye; and lance it transversely; if this does not work, do not continue to probe.
Be aware that you do not prolong the hand with lancing, as nerves are exposed there without skin.
Then immerse your hand in hot water and let the blood run into it, as if you do not immerse your hand in hot water, the blood will coagulate in the vein opening and flow is forbidden.
As the blood is drawn according to the amount of need, then you should rest on olive oil and salt over the vein, so that it does not solidify too much; and this must be done in all cases.
The translation of the sentence is: "However, the aid of left-handed trepanation (trepanning being a surgical procedure that involves drilling a hole in the skull) is given to the sicknesses of the liver."
"Perform the trepanation as you have done with the other (side/patient)."
"The aid of the saphenous vein trepanation is for illnesses located in the lower part of the body, such as hernias, retention of menstrual flow, and lung diseases and ulcers of the chest and old wounds, and similar illnesses."
"The quality of the trepanation on that (side/patient) is that the patient places their foot in hot water and make a hole there until the veins appear; then around the joint of the foot with a bandage; and the location of the vein must be felt and from that point it should be pierced, and from there it branches out on the surface of the foot making small incisions."
"And therefore trepanate the foot broadly or to the side of the cavity must be pierced, as it is better and cleaner."
"And if you trepanate on the surface of the foot, then be careful not to damage the nerves that are below there on the surface of the foot, and pause your trepanation with the one you trepanated through earlier, as if you were about to cut it."
"Let your trepanations be small (incisions)."
"However, if bleeding is forbidden (prohibited), then immerse the foot in hot water and let the blood run out in that until it is drained."
"And if the trepanator makes a mistake in the first observation, immerse it (the foot) again in hot water and let the blood run out with the trepanation for a short while, as the area is clean; do not worry about any danger, but be careful of the nerves as has been said."
"Perform the same operation on the other foot (side/patient)."
"And of the sciatic vein, the location as has been said must be pierced to the side of the wild thigh (hip)."
"The aid of trepanation on that (side/patient) is for sciatica pain when it is due to bleeding."
"The quality of the trepanation on that (side/patient) is that the patient immerses themselves in a bath, and makes their back stiff and presses their loins from below the waist to above the thigh for four fingers length using a thin long bandage, which can only be seen through it."
"And therefore when it appears (the vein), then trepanate it according to each technique that is possible for you and according to the transverse, as this is better; or cut it through incision or sever it through cutting, as the area is clean."
"And it is in many men who are weakened; and if it atrophies (the vein), and it does not appear to the senses, then trepanate one of its branches, and that which appears on the back of the foot near the auricular (anterior tibial) and the anular (posterior tibial) veins."
"Be careful of the nerves, and let the blood run as much as you want."
"And loosen the constriction and pause over the location of the trepanation site and press the area lightly, as it heals easily."
"Of ventosection (suction) and the qualities of using them."
"Ventoses are for corns, or warts, or veins."
"Ventosection is done in two ways: one with incision and blood extraction, and the other without incision."
"And this ventosection without incision is done in two ways, either with fire or without fire."
"And the locations where ventoses with incision and blood extraction are administered are twelve throughout the body, of which one is where ventoses are placed, and it is the anus; and the middle part of the neck; and the ventoses on the chin below the jawbone; and two spatulas; and the ventoses in the elbow joint; and the ventoses in the wrist joint; and the ventoses in both hips; and the ventoses in both knees."
"Ventosection does not extract the blood from veins, but only from small scattered veins in the flesh, and therefore it does not have the effect of cauterization through trepanation; nor is it necessary that ventosection be done with fire or without fire in any disease caused by accumulation inside until the entire body is evacuated."
"However, if necessity requires ventosection for an illness or a continuation, administer it at the beginning and end of every month, and in its middle and at any other time."
And when it often happens for some reason, and specifically if it is in the third or fourth day of the month, then command venesection to be performed after two or three hours have passed.
In addition to venesection of the neck, when that causes heaviness in the head and if it causes sinking into the lungs; however, it must be appropriate evacuation of the entire body.
And this venesection is at the site of cranial puncture.
It is not allowed to use one who is suffering from complete plague or catarrh, for it causes great harm.
And for that reason, it is not necessary to use the elderly, and in those who have feverish illnesses.
But if that person is to remain there continually, then forgetfulness is performed; and for this reason, you must command the venesection performer to dip his hand a little in water at the opening on the side, to prevent the generation of forgetfulness.
However, venesection of the nape is at the site of cranial puncture of the vein of the occiput and the basilica: and for this reason it causes asthma, constriction of the airways, and the splitting of the windpipe, cough, and congestion.
And the venesection of the nape must be small, for if it is left untouched, it generates weakness in the body and the stomach.
And venesection of the temporal region causes accidental pain in the head and otalmia, migraine, inflammation, and toothaches; and it is at the site of cranial puncture of the basilica.
And you must command the venesection performer not to press his hand with incision, so as not to cut the artery and cause bleeding.
Venesection on the side of the chin causes alcohol in the mouth, corruption of the gums, similar to other illnesses that are in the mouth; and it is at the site of cranial puncture called alisherius, which is between the lips.
However, venesection performed on both cheeks causes cephata, which is caused by congestion of heat.
And venesection at the inner sides of both eyelids also provides cranial puncture of three veins, namely basilica, occipital and cephalic; because it draws blood from all those veins that are in the flesh, and the smaller veins of the other larger veins until they reach the attraction to the three veins.
You must command the venesection performer not to proceed with incision because the area is denuded of flesh, and below it are nerves and arteries.
And it is a venesection on the buttocks, which causes hemorrhoids of the anus and ulcers below.
And you must command the venesection performer to make a large venesection, and that it should be from the artery, because the area requires a deep incision; and strong veins are broken by subtle venesections and it should be incised with incision.
However, venesections on the legs should be made smaller because of manifest minority, for they draw blood from the entire body, and cause ancient pain in the throat and womb, and bladder; they induce menstruation, and cause both sore and abdomen; and are at the site of cranial puncture of two popliteal veins, and also at the sites of two cubital veins.
However, it weakens the entire body and causes fainting in many men.
And the venesections also at the site of the cubital veins provide the benefit similar to the venesections of both legs.
The quality of the position for venesections is that you hold the venesection at the beginning for a short time and then let it bleed gradually, and do not prolong the position of the venesections; instead, hold them lightly, keep them constantly, and allow the humors to come to the place by gravity. And do not cease this and continue until you see the location redden and swell and the redness of blood appear.
And then you incise and draw blood little by little, and pay attention to the position of the body.
Because that man with a thin skin and few pores, it is necessary for you to incise once and not more, so as not to ulcerate the location.
And command the venesection performer to widen the incision and make a small puncture, and take blood with ease.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary that you incise twice because in the first incision the path to thinning of the blood and its wateriness is opened. However, in the second one for the vigorous search for the thick extraction of blood.
And if the blood is very viscous, it should be incised a third time to achieve the desired result.
Finally, when we want to draw blood little by little or in small amounts, it is sufficient for us with one incision.
And if we want to draw a lot of blood, we incise with many incisions; and if we know that the blood is thick, it is necessary for us to incise with heavy incision.
The depth of the incision is the term for scarification only.
If the skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, it is necessary to anoint the incision sites with a lenient, resolving oil; if it is in summer, use aloe oil or violet oil, or double-almond oil, or camomile oil, and if it is in winter, use nutmeg oil, lily oil, camomile oil, or turpentine oil, and similar substances.
If the excess is thick, greasy, fry it with bitter oil, or balm oil, aloe oil, or anise oil, and similar substances.
But if the hernia has large openings with soft flesh, it is necessary to prohibit oil and wash the hernia sites with warm water or water boiled with salt, or water of vinegar, or water of barley, and similar substances.
If the blood is watery, wash the hernia sites with vinegar water, or water of myrtle and sumac, and similar substances.
If the swellings are thick, wash the hernia sites with elderberry vinegar, or water of fennel, which is greater calaminthe, or decocotion of anise, or camomile, and similar substances.
The hernia should be kept away from bathing; having it administered immediately after bathing for an hour or two, and it should sleep next to the hernia.
What is necessary to be done so that a venous sandbag (?) is strapped before ventotomy (?).
Consider at the beginning: if the hernia or the one who will phlebotomize (?) is bilious and has venous bleeding and inflammation, it is necessary to take cold remedies, such as milkgrease acetic acid, endive in vinegar, and lettuce, and similar substances.
And pause their food such as poultry, game birds, and acidic foods, and similar substances.
If the complexion is greasy, it should take artichoke syrup or artichoke syrup of asafoetida seeds and sumac, and a mild-smelling oil between winter and spring; and it should be instructed to drink little and eat sparingly, and avoid poultry, rabbit, and fish and small birds and doves.
It is necessary that on the day of hernia surgery and phlebotomy, the drink should be more than the food.
It is necessary to give them turmeric and alum in drink at certain hours for some men, or medicines of musk, which are muskroot or celery, before hernia surgery or phlebotomy or near it, so that the main members are comforted and the blood is made thinner; and they should not take that scalding (?).
But the hernias that are not incised are hernias that are paused in the liver, on the spleen and on the umbilicus, in the joints, and in the anus, because these members cannot tolerate incision on them.
It is not sought for these but the attraction of blood from a member, such as pausing a hernia on the breast in case of bleeding of the nose and blood from the nostrils; and they use it to dissolve thick, inviscid swelling of the member, such as pausing on the abdomen and umbilicus; because this rarefies the member and scalds it and eases the pain by resolving swelling.
It has already been paused on the nose when it occurs in its opening or pain, because by the strong attraction it reduces swelling and eliminates the pain from its location.
Similar is when it is paused on the liver and spleen, as it resolves swelling in those trapped places.
These hernias are administered with juice only; and some are administered with fire.
And some are administered full of thick water in diseases of the spleen.
This is so that the hernia is filled and made large, this is thick water only or water in which are cut herbs appropriate for it.
Method of hernia administered with fire: the width of the orifice should be two fingers, according to how we have made it; and the amount of the probe (?) should be the size of a palm; and in the depth, in the area that is in the circumference, the size should be the same as the depth, the prong should be small according to the amount that enters into it with an awl.
It should be made of earth or clay, with thick edges, lion's teeth and smooth for it not to injure the member in its position on it.
And a small, horizontal channel of earth or iron, where a candle is placed with fire.
And this hernia should be larger than the one we have recommended; and the little difference from that according to the diseases and the state of the person who uses it.
The hernias of infants and weaklings are other than the hernias of young and strong-bodied people.
The quality of stopping this abscess with fire upon the member (body part) is that it should be opened with a suitable amount of wood (firewood) in front of a little wax candle, and it should be stopped on the middle of the lower abdomen at the proper place of the abscess, so that the fire is ignited nearby the incision without burning the patient's body.
The abscess on the patient's member should be stopped at the place mentioned earlier, until when we have boils and do not need to open it and let the steam rise from that hole, then the abscess will soon be resolved.
Heat the wound according to its method, and repeat it if necessary.
However, in an abscess related to pleurisy, it is administered with water (without a lower abdominal transverse line or hole), and is filled only with water and stopped on the member alone.
This is the method: The larger the abscess, the better, as it can hold more water.
Capital 75.
Sanguisuggae are not administered in swollen members but in members where the position of abscesses is not possible due to their small size, such as gums and similar areas; or in denuded members (exposed bone), such as the nose and its vicinity.
The quality of using those Sanguisuggae that you have found in the clean waters of purification.
They should be soaked in clean water for two days and then left to rest until they are hungry, and no cause remains in the stomach of those (leaches). It is appropriate to evacuate the body at the beginning with phlebotomy and abscesses; it is appropriate to cleanse the patient's member until it becomes red; and it is appropriate for them to be placed over it.
And when they are filled and ready.
And if it is possible to suck the area with the abscess, it is more beneficial in treatment.
If not, wash the area with salt water and apply cold water; then cleanse it and squeeze it.
If the bleeding of the patient continues after using Sanguisuggae, and it is draining, you should place a cloth dipped in cold water on top until the drainage stops.
If the bleeding is excessive, sprinkle vitriol triturated (or similar substances for stiptics causes) on it until the bleeding stops; or place hot fava beans (broad beans) that have been boiled and ground into powder over the area and leave them there until they adhere to the affected location, and the bleeding stops.
And if necessary, repetition of Sanguisuggae, when possible, changing those (leaches) as needed.
If the use of Sanguisuggae is prohibited or suspended, wash the area with fresh blood or insert a needle into the affected locations until it bleeds; then place them over it, as those that feel any bleeding will soon adhere to it.
When you wish them to pass (stool), sprinkle a little of crushed aloe, salt or ash over it, and let it be immediately.
E quan voles que cajan, polveriza sobre aquelas un pauc de aloen trissat, o sal, o cendre, e cazo tantost. This chapter is observed as necessary in the art of medicine; and it concerns the restoration of fractures and dislocations of bones due to accidents.
Oh son, beware that foolish doctors and the common people boast about this chapter, and those who for a time do not read the books of the ancients nor learn a single letter from them.
Therefore, this method of the learned men in our land is hidden; and I have not forgotten it for a time, but I have only applied what follows after prolonged reading of the books of the ancients and study on their understanding, until I extracted the science from them.
And direct it to experience and study in the course of my life.
And you have now described in this chapter all that concerns the main science and on which my experience has been passed; therefore, I have condensed it for you and relieved it of lengthy discussion; and I have summarized it at the end of summary; and shown it at the end of explanation; and formed many forms of the instruments used in it, as is done by adding explanation, just as I did in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter First.
Summary and collections from the essence of fractures in bones, from which it is necessary to make a preliminary explanation before we begin remembering the restoration of broken members and various others of each. Therefore, let me state in the prelude of this chapter the summary of the discourse; and the chapters to which it is necessary for the craftsman to devote himself and stand still on the truth of these, so that you and those who are prompt and can learn or understand this noble art from you.
And therefore I say that when a fracture, dislocation, twist, or break occurs, it is necessary at the beginning to apply phlebotomy or leeching to it, or whatever else is not prohibited by any reason, such as weakness of virtue, or if it happens in an invalid, or in old age, or during hot weather, or during cold.
And let it be provided with food consisting of grassy herbs and meats of birds and crabs; and forbid large meats and fill them if they are filled with food and any food that fills the veins with blood, unless you are sure of a cauterized abscess, and if you fear effusion of matter in the member.
And then return the patient to his primary regimen according to his usual custom.
And since the broken bone begins to be restored, it is necessary that the patient be fed with nutritive foods consisting of dense and heavy nourishment in which there is viscosity, such as food made from cooked wheat flour and water, rice, cabbage, peas, beef, fresh fish, thick milk, eggs, and similar foods, and on this diet coagulation of the fracture occurs more easily.
And you should know that the bones broken in men who are in the prime of life and in old age cannot be continued and consolidated according to their nature due to the drying out of the members.
But nature adjusts and connects some cause similar to glue in the broken bone of every part, which causes swelling that adheres to it until it is consolidated and hardened together, until the end of growth and firmness comes, such as fire at the beginning, unless you prohibit this from its work.
And for this reason it is necessary to stop the food of the patient, food that is heavy and viscous and dense, as we have said.
And you should know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the members, because a fracture in the bone of the thigh is different from a fracture in the bone of the head; and the fracture of the bone of the foot is different from the fracture of the bone of the hand; and similarly all other members are different from each other.
And I will proceed with the memory of every type of fracture, explained in its separate chapter.
Diversity of fractures within itself. And the types of fractures in bones are diversified within themselves; because a curved fracture is different from one that occurs at the stars, and some are fractures according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the tibia and shinbone and those that occur without or with addition, such as the one prepared for writing, and is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and is a fissure fracture.
And in all cases it is an engine or torment specifically in the restoration of him, according to his recall of himself in distinct locations.
A movable splint for a bone fracture. A fractured bone is recognized by its deformity, and from this projection and perception of it in sensation, and from this when you compress it with your hand.
Therefore, if there is no deformity apparent or it does not hurt when touched with movement of the bone and the patient does not experience great pain, then it is not a fracture here.
It is possible that there is a deformity or small fissure, in which case you must press it with your hand and compress all of it; pause over the medicine that comes to mind at that moment suitable for the location; and apply narrowly with subtle compression.
And know that the place which is arched and not split in two or otherwise that does not happen in the stagnation, such as the entire part of its circumference, then it is necessary to begin from your time with the rectification of it, having applied an abscess cauterization.
And if an abscess cauterization has occurred, then leave it for several days until the abscess ceases; and apply a guaze over it according to any method that you can with delicacy and skill.
And know that the restoration of it and piercing of it is easier than drilling a bone where such stagnation occurs.
Apply strength according to the recall of it.
But if there is stagnation in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two parts, if it is an arm or a foot; or with your hand if the member is small; or with two ropes or with one rope and your hand.
Place yourself in a position according to which you will hold the injured member according to its natural figure, while the parts are extended from the broken member, then proceed with the return of these additions with skill and according to any method that can be used in their locations.
And beware so that your strength does not harm the patient by your operation or injury; and proceed with the skill that you apply one bone to another in their best forms.
And it is necessary that at that time you touch with your hand this, and if there are any other causes here, correct this and hold it in place according to the quantity of your strength.
And avoid excessive extension and compression, as do foolish doctors who often cause abscesses through their operation or cause contractions in the member as we have seen through the operation of their hands.
And the quality of the compression of the injured member is that which I recommend; for you know that fractured members are various in their smallness and size, and in the shape of these.
And for those that are small such as the arm and the thigh and similar ones, then it is necessary that the covering be of thin wool.
But for those that are thick such as the thigh or leg, it is necessary that there be a broad and hard covering, because the linen connects the large member with strong compression all around with compression, so that filth does not enter.
And begin, begin with your alignment of evacuation, pause appropriately for this, on the location of the fracture with three or four coverings according to what the member needs; and strengthen your hand a little with the linen.
And approach this to the area above the break in the fracture site, and strengthen little by little so that your compression does not weaken the site of the fracture. And approach the length of the cover at the site of the fracture slightly, and soften the little compression bit by bit, until you take a large portion of it.
And take another bandage and wrap it over the injured site with the cover, and approach the covers to the area below the fracture; and your operation is in the compression of the bandage and softening of this according to what I have said in the primary cover above.
And approach the stops of the lion skin or wool in which the deformity of the fracture is held, if there is deformity; and do not stop in any other cause.
And approach the other bandage, and apply over these well-made stars coverings promptly if there is no inflammation or abscess cauterization in the location, and then stop on that which the abscess occurs and stops the inflammation; and leave this for several days; and you strengthen over the stars.
And they are the stars of the canna lada race, well-formed; or made from pine wood; or from palm branches; and each star should be as wide as this form and figure:
But the splint that is placed over the fracture should be wider and longer in proportion to the member on which it rests; and strengthen the splint with another band according to your initial tightening; and place the other binding above it correctly, as was said about the tightening, and your tightening should be smaller near the fracture and larger further away from the fracture.
The threads should be medium in thickness and flexibility, and made of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the operation of some foolish people using thick ropes to tie them, it is a great error when the tightening is not even.
And very thin threads are not appropriate because you will not be able to achieve the desired tightening with them, and it is not necessary that there be a space of less than one finger between splints.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints near the tightening at the location, then place a layer of felt or camel's wool between them until it does not cause injury.
Some fractures are with abscess, and there is a rupture in the tendon, and I will remember it in that chapter under special circumstances.
And know that all broken members are not strengthened with splints on the first day; the reason being that the member, when it is large, does not require splints immediately but rather after 5 to 7 days or more, depending on your certainty of the development of an abscess.
And this is the method of bandaging with which the ancients restored broken bones, joints and twists.
Common bandage method for the restoration of fractures, appropriate for complex cases and more so for women and children because it does not require warmth or moisture; take powder from ground barley and is the marrow of the millstone that you grind in the walls of the mill.
Place it like this, but if it is not like that, filter it with albumen of egg white, and complete the preparation without thickness or thinness, and use it for that.
Another method of treatment for fractures, dislocations and twists: a recipe for asafetida, lapacho, acacia, eucalyptus, myrrh and aloe vera, which is prepared from 1000 grains of salvage miller's sandalwood, 5 drams of myrrh and aloe, 20 drams of aloechil; they should be crushed and sifted, then mixed with either aloe juice or egg white if the patient's complexion is scalded; and use this plaster, as it has a good composition and restores broken bones gently, and confers strength to many men.
Another method of treatment for fractures and twists: a recipe for myrrh, aloe vera, white clay and eucalyptus, which is prepared with ten drams of myrrh, five drams of aloe vera, twenty drams of eucalyptus, and six drams of Armenian pitch.
All are strained in a mortar with crushed alum, filtered, and mixed with water or egg white and administered.
Method of bandaging for separated joints and bones in their place, as well as pain in those places and cracks and fractures: take wool and immerse it in vinegar and oil and apply it over the area.
More in this bandage does not have the virtue of restoration, but rather of abscess, pusulation and alleviating pain specifically.
Another method of bandaging for broken bones: take fig leaves and wild poppy leaves, grind them all together to make a bandage.
Method of bandaging wrapped for the restoration of fractured bones and when you want the solution to the abscess: recipe of alum, camomile, violets, wild thyme, all in equal parts .i. All are strained and mixed with vinegar if the member is not scalded.
If it is scalded, then place it with water of wet colander or water and use it.
Another method of bandage with strong solution for the resolution of long-lasting abscess in the member when it is required: recipe of alum and its seeds, and balm, mellilot, marjoram, violets, camomile, all in equal parts and honey; all are strained and mixed with water of savory or sweet water or vinegar, all according to the quality of the member and the reappearance of the color of it.
May Hippocrates not say in his book that it should be placed on the broken member before its restoration, except for a splint made of wax and oil and no other cause; and recommend that it be neither too thick nor too thin.
And according to Galen, it should be placed on the broken member before its restoration and the causes in which there is drying with little heat are such as myrrh, ambergris, and similar to those causes that we have recommended.
A recipe for a plaster to treat wounds and pain: grind myrtle leaves, hysop, human skin scraped or goose down feathers, and althea root, and salt, all ground together; sieve and sift it, and cook it, and make it into a plaster.
If the wound requires that it remain open and should be sutured, consider whether there is pain or purulence or if the bone is broken from its place; then you should not undo it for several days. And if there is a strong pain or purulence or inflammation at the site, then you should cut or undo it in that hour and remove the plaster from it.
Take a cloth and sea sponge dipped in warm water, immerse it in hot water, and with that wash the site until the purulence ceases and the pain is alleviated; then let it rest for an hour; and apply a linen cloth soaked in sour vinegar or oil or rose oil over it for one night until you are sure of cauterizing the abscess, and to rest the inflammation of the member, and that the pain be alleviated.
And apply a thin and gentle constraint and small plaster to the site without tightening it too much with your initial constriction, and gently until it is healed.
And if the abscess, redness, pain, inflammation, and all the symptoms are already healed, and no longer need a plaster or constraint, then you can close it as you did at the beginning of the healing process.
And if there is no cause on the limb of those that we have mentioned, then you should not undo it, but let it be for three or four days or more. And for some weeks everything is left as it was due to the dislocation of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and the flesh heals over it.
Then you should adjust the constraint more than in your initial constriction and tighten the clothing of the patient according to the swelling of the limb as memory dictates.
And if you see that the site of the fracture is already dry and extended more than necessary, then know that nourishment should not reach it; so wrap it in hot water for all observation periods, and this should be done for three days; and gradually loosen the constraint, and through this action bring the nourishment to the limb, and heal it slightly.
What the foolish restorers of the fractured limb do after a period when it is not restored at the beginning, as required, and is restored incorrectly, according to their operation, and great fear, if this were correct they would have increased what the ancients wrote in their books and practiced.
And I have not seen any of them do this, so it is more reasonable that they should not do it.
Chapter on: When a fracture occurs in the head.
The types of fractures are multiple, and the shapes of them are diverse, and the causes are distinct, since some fractures are caused by blows to the bone, and the blow completely breaks the bone from within, which is called comminuted; or the blow cuts a part of the bone and the wound cuts the flesh but does not pass through to the other side; and this type of fracture is called absolute elevation.
And the wound in these two types of fractures is either large or small, and whether the fracture is contracted or traction; and its cause is a blow with a hammer or by falling on stones, and similar to them.
And this fracture is penetrating, which approaches the panniculus that is behind the bone; or it is on the face of the bone, and the wound in these two types of fractures can be large or small.
And there is a type of fracture that is weakened in the bone, in the fineness of the hair-like fissures, and for this reason this type of fracture is called capillary.
A fracture that is caused by falling or hitting a stone, and similar, which causes one layer of the bone to split at the joints from within, and it occurs in concave areas such as when it happens to the kneecaps when they are hit and split from the inside.
And moreover, this occurs in bones that are soft, such as infant skulls.
And to all these types of fractures, they are like scattered stars. I will return to the memory of everything in its place.
And we should know all these types of fracture by detection on them and investigation of them with tests and the examination of rotten flesh that is over them.
A special type of capillary is recognized because it appears on the bone, is drained, and coagulates over it when it becomes black, as a fracture appears.
In the treatment of fractures, one should first consider the patient's symptoms, and if you find signs that indicate fear such as vomiting of bile, extension, loss of consciousness, abscess of the throat, fainting, acute fever, inflammation or redness of the joints and similar symptoms in the larger context, one doubts whether it will heal.
And if you find unusual symptoms, you hope for health, then you begin treatment of it.
The cause is that if it has come to you to treat it at the beginning as it comes in winter days, then it is necessary for you to study the bone structure before the twelfth day according to all disposition.
And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary that you take care of the bone before the seventh day, knowing that the bone will be rotten by the panniculus, and accidents may occur as we have advised.
And if the fracture has reached the panniculus covering the brain, and it is divided into small pieces and crushed, then it is necessary that you open up the compressed and fragmented part, as I will advise you.
And it is that you shave the head of the patient with the injury, and you open up on the bone according to your custom and as you can, following the figure of the wound, and be gentle with the patient.
And if it happens that you must examine the bone, discharge blood or an abscess, then you should proceed with what is necessary, and it is that you apply warm cloths soaked in wine and rose oil to the wound, and let it rest until the abscess subsides, and be sure of discharging blood; and begin with the examination of the bone and removal of it.
And that is one of two methods of operation.
And the first method is that you open up the bone with a straight saw-like instrument, and this is its form: Take another saw of similar size; and this is its form:
Then apply more the saw than the second.
It is necessary that you have a number of saws of different sizes, some of which are longer than others; and some of them should be shorter than the others, and they should be at the end of their sharpness, and made of iron or steel.
Use them with ease in striking the saw to avoid damaging the head and teeth.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then it is necessary that you drill around it before administering the saws with handles, which are called non-penetrating chisels.
They are not called thus because they do not reach the end of the bone to that which is at the head, so that the chisel has a rounded or tapered tip on its sharp edge resembling the rim or small circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the bone.
It is convenient that you take many of these chisels as needed for the thickness of each bone, until it is present at all parts of the skull where the edge is sharp, the quantity in length and width according to the thickness of that bone.
This is the form of three types of chisels: The quality of drilling around the broken bone is that you place the chisel on the bone and rotate it with your thumbs until you know that the bone has been penetrated; then move the chisel to another place, and place what is between all the way through the thickness of the ray or around it.
Then open up the bone with saws between each crack, and do it as finely as possible at the end of delicacy, as we have said, until you break the bone, or with your hand, or with any other cause using instruments that you will prepare for this, such as tweezers and forceps.
It is necessary that you be careful so that the incision does not touch any cause of the hernia.
When you perforate the bone, if it is continuous with the hernia and separated from it, and you have to extract that part, it is necessary to cut and round off that part on the edge of the bone using a tool similar to an incision, but nonetheless it is necessary that it be very sharp and very thin compared to other incision tools.
If any small fragment of the bones remains and adheres, then take it with ease using what you have of tools; and apply ointment and poultice to the wound which we have mentioned.
The other method of operation is easy and distant from fear, which we call guillotine and the name is praised greatly; and this is the meaning: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin to uncover the fracture part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most visible and manifest, until when you have discovered that part and placed a cushion under the end of the incision tool, which has the following form (long and curved):
It is true that the semi-lunar fracture is round and does not cut any cause, while the acute fracture is in two directions advancing in length, as sometimes; so that the semi-lunar fracture should be adjacent to the hernia with its rounded edge cutting into the bone.
Then strike the incision tool against one part of the bone with a small hammer until you have cut the entire bone with ease, and you should be confident in the padding that no accident will occur in any way; and if the patient were the most foolish man among all men and the most ignorant about medicine, certainly, he would be asleep.
Then, if any cause is attached to the bone of the padding in some locations of the bone, cut that part with the rounded tip of the incision tool, and remove it easily, as it has been freed from harm and fear.
If the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the padding, and what is detached or remains attached to the bone is the surface, and it remains rough and subtle protrusions, then you must cut that roughness and remove those subtle protrusions with sharp razors which you have prepared in various quantities so that it is possible for you to administer them in all locations as most conveniently and correctly according to where you lose your operation of the broken bone and its shape.
It is necessary that you use the razor with which you cut the bone at first on the most subtle part of it, and do not stop doing so until you reach the point of administering the very thin layer and the very subtle part of all of them.
But in any case of small vein-like fractures and subtle fractures, you must administer care according to what you lost at correction of it.
It is because it cannot be reduced in all those who have studied that art. Stand on what we have shown about large fractures.
If the padding is rectangular when you remove the bone, then you must take cloth of the same size as the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place that on the orifices of the wound; and take another cloth doubled or tripled and immerse it in vinegar and rose oil and place that over the first cloth lightly on top of it, so as not to injure the hernia; and apply ointment sparingly over it, but not forcefully except according to the size of the wound alone.
Leave it with this care for a day or two until you are sure of cautery abscess; and then remove that and administer medicines with which excessive dryness is required, such as lentils and flour, and powder of sandalwood and aristolochia, and similar ones.
It is that you make the powder of these medicines dry on the wound, as it dries; and generally, administer all medicine with properties of which it absorbs and does not injure.
Take care according to your virtue that the wound in your treatment remains clean; and do not apply ointment or any other substance; nor leave it with putridity or anything similar; for when it is adjacent to the padding of the brain, it corrupts that and then poisons the patient, causing him great evil.
If it happens in the hernia of the head, as the bone is purified and especially when the care of it is administered, and it turns black on its surface; then consider whether the patient has experienced the accidents that we have mentioned, know that it is harmful without any doubt.
And if it does not happen blackness except from the medicine that is applied, and it is due to that medicine that such blackness occurs, then you must take a part of honey and three parts of oil. and cover that area with a cloth, and place a cure for healing on it until it is healed.
Chapter III.
On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that it is not broken in the nose but two fractures together with one of them observed, because there are two bones, and the other fracture is cartilaginous, and it does not break and will not happen to it except traction, curvature, and deviation.
But if one of the two parts is broken, then it must be that you insert your little finger into its own nose and grasp that fracture inside with your thumb, and with your index finger outside, until the nose returns to its natural figure. And let this be done for your convenience, and be careful not to hurt the patient during your treatment.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the little finger does not reach it, then it must be aligned with the end of the thumb where there is a small swelling.
If the fracture is in two parts, you should do what was said above.
And apply the restoration to it in the first day of the fracture if possible; and if not, then wait for the seventh or tenth days to rest the cauterized wound.
Insert a small piece of cloth into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part, or two tweezers, if the fracture is in two parts, and it should be with the thickness of a sufficient amount to fill the cleft of the nose.
And as the ancient restorers said, the tweezers should be wrapped in thread and tied throughout the day, but I do not see this; however, it must be that the piece of cloth is wrapped in hog's fat with powdered millstone, and leave it in until the bone is set and the cartilage hardened.
Sometimes insert your fingers into the nose instead of tweezers, in case the little finger is not available because it is wrapped in lion's cloth; and it should be that you already have the fracture of the nose very strong and the patient is not prohibited from inspiration.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you want, do it, and if you want, use tweezers.
And if there is another wound cauterized, fill the nose with beeswax or cotton stuffed with vinegar oil or diacylon.
But if there is no cauterized wound, you must fill it outside with sieved flour and powdered charcoal mixed with hog's fat, and place a lion-skin cloth over it, and do not touch the nose for any reason.
But if the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture or comminuted, you must cut it open, extract those bones using instruments suitable for them; and sew up the incision, heal it with what nourishes and consolidates, and use the appropriate filler.
If a wound occurs inside the nose, you must heal it with tweezers and administer leaden cannula until it is completely healed.
Chapter IV.
On the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by an open wound, then examine it to see if the fracture is only on the outside, and whether it is not broken in two and curved towards the inside partitions, then its recognition is easy.
Therefore, if the fracture is in the right side, you must insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the right index finger; and press gently against the swelling of the fracture towards the inside partitions with the other hand from the outside, while pushing evenly on that area.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two parts, you must administer extension of the two sides according to rectitude until it is possible for them to be aligned.
And if there is shaking of teeth to dislocation, then stabilize those that you hope will remain with gold or silver wire or ivory; and place a beeswax on the broken jaw, and place a double cloth, and place a large piece of felt well made, or one piece of sola the length of the jaw, over it, and place it appropriately depending on how the healing of it is prepared and what the application requires, until it is not destroyed.
And tell the patient to rest and take a calm diet, and stop giving them sour foods.
If you suspect that the figure has been altered in some way, then wait until the third day and remove it; afterwards, correct what has been altered and apply powder of milled oregano, album of egg white, or flour of camomile, as you will have left the wound open, and let it heal with woolen lamb's wool.
Keep that plaster attached to it and, if the bone's disposition is not altered, leave it alone until it is healed and the fracture is strengthened; for this fracture is usually tightened in three weeks.
And if another swelling appears as an abscess, administer what was mentioned earlier in its treatment until it is healed, and let the abscess be drained.
If the fracture is ulcerated, consider whether it is a separated piece of bone or shattered, then be careful to remove those shattered pieces with the appropriate instrument.
If the orifices of the ulcer are narrow, you should widen them with a blunt probe according to your need.
Then, when you have removed those shattered pieces and no pus has flowed out of them, widen the orifices of the ulcer if they are wide; otherwise, place one of the dressings suitable for this purpose on it and pack it, until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
On the restoration of the clavicle when it is fractured.
Usually a broken clavicle breaks at the junction of the bone, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Because it is broken, separated, or separated into two pieces that do not shatter; and this is easy to restore; or it happens like this when the bone shatters, making restoration difficult; or the fracture occurs with an ulcer.
And the operation when the fracture is without an ulcer is that you have two assistants present; one will hold the broken clavicle and follow it, while the other extends the neck to that junction.
Then align the fracture with your thumbs until the bone shape is correct and neither protrude too much nor have a concavity.
And if you need more extension, cover the patient's hand with fabric or wool and let its size correspond to your need; extend, lift, and bend the clavicle and hold the hand with your hand until you align the fracture as required.
And if you cannot pull the extremity of the clavicle to the junctions outside, because it is prevented by the pronator, then have the patient lean back on their neck and place a larger cushion on the muscle of the affected side.
The assistant presses the muscle of the affected side towards the junctions until the clavicle bone is lifted beyond the pronator and then you correct the fracture and align it with your thumbs.
If you feel shattered bones in the clavicle and they are painful, then you must break it open and extract those shattered pieces with ease.
If it is held in the bone, you must make an incision in it with one of the instruments you have prepared for this purpose, as you had placed the clavicle chisel on the side that serves to chip; and this tool is a rod or iron with the following shape:
And its shape is like a spoon with this concavity; and let its width correspond to your need for it, according to the size of the bone or the thinness of it.
However, the length of it should be as much as possible for the operation; it must have two ends like this, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the ulcer that you have incised when you extracted the bone shatter is wide and it is certain that there is an abscess, then you adjust the two lips of the ulcer with sutures.
If the disruption is small or you fear an abscess, fill the ulcer with fabrics and powders according to the size of the ulcer's incision.
If an abscess occurs, pour wine with vinegar and oil on it and let it rest.
And it is necessary that the splint not be harmful to the broken bone; therefore, you must observe the patient every day, as when the limb becomes soft or the swelling goes down, then you correct it and strengthen the wound.
Then place the pillow of the patient on their neck and place the head of the patient on a small cushion; so that the neck of the affected limb may be raised, and thus the fracture of the collarbone is elevated by lifting the muscle; or the arm of the patient is tied to the neck of the affected limb.
And do not loosen the bindings unless there is pus or an abscess in that area, for up to twelve days.
Then renew the plaster if you see the face of it, and adjust in the tightness and restore it until it is restored and the fracture of the collarbone is coagulated.
And it is strengthened and made comfortable according to the month in twenty-eight days, and sometimes it is done in months of time for that purpose.
Chapter VI.
On the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
If the shoulder blade is broken near its edge and not through it.
And when it is broken at that location, and if it is broken in the middle of it, but not through it, and it is not known except by touch; then according to the shape of the fracture you prepare for it and reduce it according to its natural shape in every possible way using any tools available to you.
Then you place powdered poplar bark mixed with alum and lion's wool on the site; and place a double layer of cloth, and then place the sharp stake of thin wood according to the size of the shoulder blade, or slightly more.
But if the stake is hollow in some of the locations of the shoulder blade, then you fill that concavity with lion's wool and place the stake according to its size.
And strengthen it above with long human hair and tying that is appropriate and the firmness of the stake until it is no longer swollen in its place.
And consider the bindings every day, and in all cases when it becomes soft, loosen it again and tighten it equally if it is swollen in its place.
Keep the patient on his side.
The shoulder blade is restored in twenty days or more.
And when that number is complete, then you loosen the bindings and ensure that you know for sure that it is not feared or threatened by the bones from which the fracture began, nor its disintegration.
If the bone has not passed and the pus has not subsided, you cut it off, remove it, and proceed as previously described for the treatment of a collarbone fracture with an abscess or cauterization if this occurs here.
Chapter VII.
On the restoration of the fracture of the foot.
Sometimes the foot is broken in its proper place and it heals, but sometimes the extremities of it are crushed and pulverized.
And when the bone of the foot is broken in its middle, it causes a decline into the partitions within and leads to great pain, difficulty in walking, cough, high fever, and vomiting; and it is evident in the cavities of the broken bones and cannot be hidden from sensation.
The restoration is that the patient should be placed on his back and a cushion placed between his shoulders; then press the muscles of it, adjust the costal bones to its sides, and gently handle the operation with precision and accuracy according to every possible method and what is convenient, until the figure of the bone returns.
Then place the plaster and wadding on it, and place a lightweight wooden or hollow stick of similar nature on top of it, then you wrap that in cloth; and handle the broken bone gently so as not to harm it; and go along with the curvature of the backbone occasionally, strengthen it with appropriate compression, and consider the tension at all times, and when it is softened, strengthen it again.
And if there is the necessity to remove the plaster due to corrosion or pain, or an abscess that occurs in that place, then you cut and loosen it and remove the platter and correct anything caused by it with curative methods; and then adjust the plaster, if necessary, and apply appropriate compression until it heals.
Chapter VIII.
On the restoration of the ribs when they are fractured.
Know that the fracture of ribs does not occur except in thick places where they are adjacent to each other; and at their extremities from the partition front, this is caused not by contraction but due to cartilage. And knowledge of this is not concealed from sensation, you must examine it with the questions.
And the restoration should be so that you guide the fracture with questions according to the possible method, until it is united as necessary, and then plaster and strengthen the broken bone with a stick, if necessary.
And if the fracture of the ribs declines into the partitions within, then the patient experiences intense pain and puncture, similar to puncture in those who have wept, and this is due to the bones being covered with linen; and there is difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood; and this is a difficult cure.
And the ancients were cunning in that with many schemes.
And they said that: it is necessary to place food for the patient that generates inflammation and wind, so that the abdomen is inflated and extended, and the fracture is pushed towards the partitions outside.
But we should avoid that for it not to be a light cause for generating dangerous abscesses, if not necessary; and if necessary, then help with it.
Some of them said that it should be placed on windy ground and that it should be squeezed with force; and this is similar to reasoning, but it is feared that the wind draws excess towards the place due to weakness.
And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool that is immersed in oil of myrrh, and powders placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the tension is guided when wrapping it according to curvature; and cure the patient with treatment for pleurisy and medicine.
And if a patient experiences intense pressure that he cannot bear and the bone is pierced with linen through puncture, you fear for him; then it is necessary to cut open the place, expose the broken rib, and place an instrument to preserve the cavity, the memory of which has been mentioned before, and to divide the bones easily and extract it.
And then adjust the two lips of the wound if it is large with stitching and treat it with plaster until it heals.
If there is an internal abscess, then you cut and pour powder in roasted oil on it and place a plaster over the place, and cure the patient with what is necessary for the internal abscess.
And be placed on a bed on which he sleeps, until it heals.
Chapter IX.
On the restoration of fracture of the spine and neck.
Sometimes fractures occur in the bones of the neck, and they adhere to each other, and similar to the vertebrae of the back. And when something similar occurs and you want to know if it will heal or not, then consider whether its limbs are already softened and stiffened and dead and cannot move nor strengthen them and when you constrict them with your fingers or pierce them with a needle and do not feel pain in them, then you know that it is not healed, and in the month of dispositions, it is fatal.
And if they move and feel constriction with fingers and piercing, then you know that the neck of the bones is saved and that the patient can recover with treatment.
And if you see the vertebrae of the neck resembling something and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then consider the feet of it.
Here comes the second sentence to translate: Lahoras si tu vezes que so ja mollificatz, accideys ad aquels aquo que es accidit en las mas, e aprop quan jatz sobre le sieu dos, yeys ventozitat e egestio ses la sua volontat, e alcunas veguadas es resupinat sobre le sieu dos e vol urinar e no pot, lahoras sapias que es mortal, e adonc no trebales en la curacio de lu.

If an abscess occurs that requires cauterization, then you cease the extension of it and its restoration until the abscess is subdued, and you place something on top of it as prescribed; and then return to the restoration of it, and strengthen it in this way as necessary.
If a fracture or broken bone occurs, then you treat them.
Chapter XI.
On the restoration of the fracture of the ankle bone.
The ankle bone is what is between the heel and the shoulder of the arm.
And if it is broken, the restoration of it is done in one of two ways, of which one is that you take flat pieces of moderately coarse millstone in this manner:
And place them at the two extremities of two pieces of linen, and then suspend them from a raised location.
Follow the patient over a chair, and place their broken arm on the millstone pieces until it reaches the handle in the appropriate location where its curve is attached to the millstone.
Suspend it from some heavy object, or else the servant extends it to the sides; and let the doctor and his assistant hold the broken bone with their hands until the fracture returns as necessary.
The other method is that the patient lies on their back and suspends their hand from the neck with a piece of linen; then command two servants, one of whom holds something over the fracture with his hands, and the other holds the swelling below it; each extends to their side.
And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then strengthen over the fracture with two pieces of linen, and on each side with another piece of linen; and each servant extends to their sides.
Therefore, if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, then you must place a part of the linen on the handle and the other over the bone where it joins the heel.
In the same way, if the fracture is close to the heel, then you must place the linen over that location and over the heel.
Wrap it with ease and without effort, and then when it is tied as necessary and applied well, strengthen it if there is no abscess present.
If an abscess occurs, leave the wrapping for six days, and place on top of it linen soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess subsides; then strengthen it.
The method of strengthening it is to apply a plaster to the fracture, then cover it with linen wrapping over the plaster; and adjust the arm on that ankle bone, and place your hand under the muscle.
Cover the linen and strengthen the ankle bone with the arm so that the arm is in place, unless there is some reason for this due to the broken bone.
And use splints.
This is that you place over the fracture a splint that is wider and stronger than the others; and place between each splint the width of the finger, and the length of the splints according to the breakage with an addition of three fingers from all sides.
And then strengthen the splints with the bandage as described at the beginning of this chapter.
And that your bandage over the location of the fracture be tighter. And when the fracture is longer, the bandage should be looser.
And so if you see the position of the stars and the constriction as we said at the time when you are restoring the member to its proper position, then do you make (the procedure).
If it is a cauterized abscess, then you leave the constriction and the stars in for seven days as we said.
Then consider the ligament in all parts for three days to prevent inflammation or pressure at the site; or food is forbidden to reach the member due to the surplus of constriction; and so do everything as we said.
But if you are certain that there is no cause for this, then do not remove the ligature until three days or more.
Let the patient's bed be on their back, and let their hands be on their stomach.
Place a hot compress filled with wool on the fracture and consider at all times of night or day that the figure of the broken member must not be separated nor dissolved; or that the ligature is softened, so do everything as you see fit.
The patient's food should be according to the order we gave before, in such a way that the food is subtle at first and then becomes stronger; and so it is necessary to coarsen the food for them.
It is customary for the compress and blanket of him to be strong for forty days, and so it is necessary that they are removed and a bath is given, and he is treated with enemas which remedy that condition.
If the fracture is shallow, then do not remove the ligature and stitches until three days or two months.
Chapter XII.
On the restoration of a broken arm.
An arm is composed of two bones that are called two focal points; one of which is small and it is the one mentioned above near the elbow, and the other is large and it is the one placed below the small one, from the inner side of the elbow.
If only the larger bone (focal point) is broken or if both are fractured.
When the smaller bone (focal point) above is broken, the restoration of it is easier, and its healing is more rapid.
When the bone (focal point) below is broken, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Worse still is when two bones are fractured together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller one above, it is appropriate for the physician to pause with a small extension in order to make the healing easier.
But if the large bone (focal point) is fractured, you must pause with a more forceful extension.
If both bones (focal points) are fractured, you must pause the reduction less forcefully.
You must pause the figure of the hand during the restoration and extension of it, with the palm facing upwards as we said before; the thumb should be positioned above the other fingers, as well as what has been said before; the earlobe should be lower than the others, and the patient should lie on a low couch.
There should be a pillow in front of him at the height or incline of his head to prevent him from exerting himself.
The assistant should extend the arm from above with his hand or ligature and another assistant should do the same from below in the same manner.
The physician should hold the bone until it is reduced according to the best shape possible.
If there are any shards of the bone, you should make a thorough reduction at the site with your skill.
If a piece of the bone appears separated that cannot be reunited and is not in your hope for its restoration, you should make an incision on it and remove it as we said before.
But if the fracture is with a wound, we have already given you special instructions on that matter, and so take care of it accordingly.
If an abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, you should line a cloth with a mixture of rose oil and white wax that is neither too thick nor too thin; strengthen the cloth over the abscess with a gentle pressure using a subtle reduction until the abscess subsides; then remove the wax and apply an emulsion prepared from powdered moly and clover oil, and place stitches; the stitch that is placed over the fracture should be sharp and strong.
You should know that the number of stitches for an arm is determined by the major positioning (disposition), or whether the fracture is in one bone (focal point) or in two bones together.
You should pause your reduction over the site of the fracture with strong and forceful pressure; when it is necessary to extend to parts above or below the fracture, pause the reduction a little less firmly as we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
The cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist; they should not be hard or rough, and the thread used for suturing should be of moderate thickness as we have recommended.
Consider the member and the ligature for several days. If there is any reason for which correction is necessary such as inflammation occurring in the member, you must suture the member with hot water until it subsides.
And you must release the limb until it relaxes again, and return the constriction.
And if the stiffness has been softened and the bone has returned to its normal state, then correct everything with your skill.
And consider more carefully if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive constriction, for then you must soften it slightly and leave it for a few days until the nourishment returns, and apply heat to it.
But if the patient does not suffer from any of the causes mentioned earlier, then there is no need to fast for more than about twenty days or so around that time.
Then have the patient's hand suspended by its strength of movement, and make him sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture heals in thirty days or thirty-two days, or it can heal more quickly in twenty-eight days, and all of this depends on the condition of the complexion and the application of your skill.
Chapter XIII
This is the title of the chapter. It translates to "On the healing of a finger fracture and dislocations."
Know that when a finger is fractured or the joints of the knuckles are dislocated, it does not heal without proper treatment.
And when there is a finger fracture or dislocation, the patient must follow a diet appropriate to his condition and rest it on a pillow in an extended position, with the hand of the affected limb resting on top of it.
Then apply an extender to the broken bones, and the doctor should align them correctly with a good fit.
You must apply plaster and dressing if there is no abscess, but if an abscess occurs, pierce it with a probe according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen.
And if the fracture is within the palm, you should hold the back of the hand and make a bandage of fabric, instructing the patient to hold their injured hand in place with their other hand; bind it tightly with long fabric.
The probe should be made of leather with some slack, so that the probe can be applied to the palm and bound according to necessity.
If the fracture is outside the palm, you must bind the probe and another probe from the injured area to the back of the hand, so that the hand remains open and straight; then bind the affected area as it would be when bound to the forearm with linen strips.
If there is a fracture in one of the knuckles, you should bind it as required if it is a push fracture, and hold it in place with the palm while binding it; if desired, use a small straight probe to elevate the fracture and prevent it from healing incorrectly.
If the fracture is in one of the other knuckles (such as the middle finger joint, index finger joint, ring finger joint, or little finger joint), bind it and apply the necessary splint to immobilize it; or use a continuous bandage for the entire length of the finger, which is better; or use a small probe on top of it, as described in the case of the push fracture.
In your healing process, also consider the appearance of an abscess and its opposite (opposition) using the appropriate procedure, as well as what is necessary when any of these occurrences happen, according to the narrative provided.
Chapter XIV
This is the title of the chapter. It translates to "On the healing of a hip bone fracture."
A broken and dislocated hipbone is identified by its appearance, which resembles the part above and above the pubic bone.
The restoration (of the patient) is done in such a way that the plaster (or bandage) is strengthened over the fracture and another plaster removed from the fracture, and the patient is prostrate on their stomach and face.
Then extend the entire plaster to its limit according to its quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone. (Note: "liament" refers to the plaster or bandage used for healing.)
But if it is necessary to reduce the swelling of the thigh, then the plaster should be close to the edge at the end of the thigh, so that its extension covers it, and another plaster removed from the fracture. (Note: "pentenilh" refers to the thigh bone or femur.)
Similarly, if the fracture is close to the edge, then make the plaster close to the edge and extend it to the sides. (Note: This suggests that when the fracture is near the end of a bone, the plaster should be placed closer to the end and extended further out to provide support.)
Then the doctor should put both hands inside and reduce the bone according to its natural shape, so that it is joined well; at this point, you must stop plastering and applying tight bandages, unless there is an abscess in the limb. (Note: This suggests that the doctor should manipulate the broken bone back into its correct position before applying a plaster or bandage, but if there is an infection present, they should not apply the plaster or bandage to prevent further spread of the infection.) But if there is an abscess, leave it for several days until the abscess subsides, and then return to your care. (Note: This suggests that if there is an infection present, they should not apply the plaster or bandage immediately but wait for the infection to subside before continuing treatment.)
The bandaging should be done in this way: you must wrap a hard bandage around the fracture, fold it over two or three times, and remove any excess; then wrap the leg and the swelling of the thigh. (Note: This suggests that the hard bandage should be tightly wrapped around the fracture site and the affected limb to provide support and prevent movement.)
Insert a long iron rod between the thigh and the leg near the edge on both sides, and bring the ends of the rod from above both sides, and then turn it around the leg and thigh so that any excess bandage wraps over it. (Note: This suggests that an iron rod should be inserted between the thigh and the leg to provide additional support during treatment.)
Place a splint on the thigh at the location of the fracture, and place another splint over the bone of the leg. (Note: This suggests that a splint should be used to immobilize the affected limb during treatment.)
Fill the void between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bleeding stops. (Note: This suggests that the affected area should be filled with soft cloths to stop any bleeding or oozing of fluid.)
Begin with a strong bandage over the location of the fracture with three or four layers, and as you approach the plaster at the site of the fracture, your bandaging should be less tight and more loose and moist. (Note: This suggests that the affected area should be tightly wrapped initially, but as the plaster approaches the fracture site, it should be loosened to allow for swelling and healing.)
Extend the iron rod to both ends of the leg on both sides as far as it reaches the ankle of the foot, and tighten both ends of the splints of the other limb so that the plaster does not move from its position. (Note: This suggests that the affected limb should be immobilized with splints at both ends to prevent movement during treatment.)
Leave the bandaging in this way so that it does not cause corrosion, abscess, or inflammation and resembles those; if any of these occurrences happen, then remove the plaster immediately, and correct everything appropriately, according to what has been said previously. (Note: This suggests that the bandage should be applied in a way that does not cause infection or inflammation, and if any complications arise, they should be addressed immediately.)
But if there is a bone tumor present, you must remove it as much as possible; and if it cannot be completely removed, cut off the surrounding area, and treat with what was previously mentioned until it heals. (Note: This suggests that if there is a tumor in the bone, it should be removed as much as possible, but if complete removal is not possible, the affected area should be surgically excised and treated.)
Some weeks are stronger than this thigh fracture, as mentioned in the advice and in the arm. (Note: This suggests that the healing process for certain types of fractures, such as those in the thigh or arm, may take longer than others.)
However, in the restoration of this type, the patient should not experience limping; if it is only restored, and another limb is not applied, then limping is necessary for the one that is always used. (Note: This suggests that in some cases, a patient may need to use crutches or a walking aid on their unaffected leg to compensate for the immobilized affected limb during recovery.)
You should know that the illness [gout] lasts for 40 days or a little more or a little less, and all this is according to the diversity of complications and other dispositions.

The following lines appear to belong to the same section as the previous translation:
If the fracture occurs, it is not only a break but also a tear in the bone parts, and this is a plague or multiple plagues, and over all this the pain is felt.
The restoration of the bone is such that it must be brought together so that what has been broken from its parts is joined and aligned as much as possible by means of traction, padding, and fabrication (or splinting).
Then place a plaster (or bandage) and apply it over the round stone (if necessary); and press firmly with a strap (or bandage) around it (as appropriate).
Then consider all the dispositions that have been recommended in other fractures, such as the use of an apotemum (an ointment or salve) and similar substances that may be applied to prevent infection and promote healing at the site of the fracture until it is healed.
The following lines appear to be a new section heading in the text:
The following lines appear to belong to a different section of the text:
The following lines appear to belong to the same section as the previous translation:
It happens to some of the species of fracture that it happens to the two bones of the arm, and for this reason, restoration is made in this way as the restoration of the arm, and the operation of it is one.
If two bones are broken together, the cavity becomes completely divided.
If the bone is broken finely, the cavity becomes partially divided in front.
If the bone is broken coarsely, it breaks that one off, and this is due to one of the causes not being alleviated.
Then administer extension, alignment, and ligature of the splinters as per that method.
However, it is important if the fracture of the cavity has many complications, that the extension be smaller and more gentle, and alleviate with your power.
In the cavity is some cause for operation on the arm, and this occurs when you plug the splinters and complete all the procedure, then you will take pieces of pine wood that are placed at the causes that have been treated on soles, and these are made in the same way with palm branches; align them according to small roughness, and they should not be jagged, and their length according to the length of the cavity, and from the neck to the wrist.
Then wrap each piece of cloth in two layers according to its length, and place one on the division of the cavity of one side and the other on the other side, and they should be from the neck to the wrist of the foot.
Then bind the two splinters in three places of both ends and at the middle location, because with this structure the cavity is prevented from closing on the left and right side, and this is good positioning.
A brace of wood has already been administered according to the length of the cavity, and it should be placed there to prevent movement.
Moreover, you must do this in a fracture, and when that is truly a wound.
Then consider the fracture every day and study it more deeply, and you must protect it from abscess and inflammation or other similar causes; and when any cause of those occurs, then you oppose yourself to it until it is healed.
Chapter XVII.
On the fracture of the heel and the bones of the foot and toes.
Not every heel suffers from fracture; but some bones of the foot suffer fracture; and in the toes only occasional fractures occur, and they do not occur except by excessive movement.
If the bones of the foot break and sometimes those bones rise up between them, then the patient should rest his foot on the ground prepared in this way (as with a splint).
Then place one foot on that which is raised from those bones, and press, bind, and hold it in place until it returns to its original position.
Then apply a plaster and stopper on top of it, and place under the foot a small table with two flat heads.
And strengthen it with the foot in the correct position, because you have wrapped it with cloth and other causes for which it is necessary.
And when three or four days have passed, then you remove the ligament because you will find the bones bound, or broken or dislocated, and the operation in these is done in the same way as we mentioned above.
However, if some toes are broken, then you restore them, bind them in the same way as I recommend to you in the restoration of fingers on the hand. Then place the broken toe splinter according to the length of the toe, and it should be slightly curved inward; and under the foot place this table that I have recommended to you, and strengthen it with correct positioning.
However, if the fracture of the bones is two or three or more, then you place a splint according to the size of each toe wrapped in linen cloth on each toe, and strengthen the table under the heel of the foot, and stand it on one of the heads of the table so that it holds well.
And it is important for you to remember that you do not forget all the causes mentioned to you in other fractures due to accidents we have mentioned; and oppose yourself to all accidents that are necessary.
Chapter XVIII.
On the fracture of the hump of the woman and the bone of the pubic arch and the buttock of the man.
When the hump of the woman is broken, you let it heal in a hanging position, and incline it to the opposite side slightly, and hold it behind.
And the midwife fills the hump with cotton, and it should be done in the hump in this way as expected; and the woman is shaken, and the hips are raised slightly, because all this is forgotten until it comes forward to the opposite side of the hump as expected and the broken bone returns.
Then place powder on the hips, and when it is time to urinate, remove the cottons with ease and urinate, then reduce and return it in the same way as you placed it at the beginning, and then return the powder first.
Make an opening in this manner for seven days or around that time, as it will be restored.
If you wish, take an ovine bladder and force a canal made of reed through it; insert the entire bladder into the cavity and inflate the canal with air until the bladder is distended within the cavity, as the fracture will return.
Then fill it with cotton and leave it in place for several days as prescribed until it heals.
And when the bones of the pelvis in males or females are fractured, administer in their restoration and treatment of the hip bone what has been prescribed for the bone of the pelvis.
That which is right should not be hidden in these nearby fractures and that do not require much effort, especially to one who has some knowledge, study, use, and understanding of this book; for that fracture indicates to you the greatest dispositions towards righteousness in their restoration and stricture, therefore understand well.
But in the case of the male's broken tailbone, take guarguamela root and place it on the fracture; then cover it with cloth and wrap it up, let it rest for three days or around that time, and it will heal.
Chapter XIX
Of restoration of bone fractures when infected.
It is appropriate for one who has suffered a fracture with infection, and especially if the bone is large like that of the thigh or shoulder, or similar to it, that you cauterize and probe it as soon as the conditions for cauterization or probing are present as stated above.
And if the infection discharges pus, you must take measures to retain it until you pulverize gold dust over it, unless there is another reason.
Then begin the restoration of the fracture on that day, and do not delay it, unless an abscess occurs.
But if an abscess occurs cauterized, you must let the restoration wait for up to nine days until the abscess subsides, and do not approach it on the third and fourth day and thereafter, as you will cause harm.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin exposed, you must perforate it and reduce the fracture with your hands with ease and minimal extension.
But if the extension is not prepared and the situation with your hands, you must reduce it with these tools; this tool is made of iron, the length of which is seven or eight fingers, and the width according to the size of the infection; and this is necessary for the physician who will take three or four according to the amount required in the treatment of all types of fractures.
And be round, and be slightly coarse in size to avoid the compression of the fracture during the operation.
And be of sharp edges with a margin at the ends; the upper end should be thicker and from the middle towards the fractures.
This is the form of it:
It is called "labre voluntary pallet" in Greek, so it is a small flat piece of bone.
Therefore the end of it must be placed slightly elevated above the end of the prominent bone.
Insert it once into a wound until the bone is reduced and set properly.
Therefore force the fracture ends together, and if the broken end is thin, do not use the tool for good reason, but you must insert the end of the bone until the tool can grip it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone with what has been prescribed, then insert it using what is necessary for the chisels which we have mentioned, or it can be with one of the saws in any way that is possible for you.
Then remove that part which remains rough and full of small splinters.
When the bone has been reduced and the patient experiences intense pain quickly, you must understand that the bone has not returned to its natural location; and thus do what will give great benefit to the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is complete and you have placed a black stiptic cloth over it, do not apply any oil to the infection or other cause in which there is ointment, as this will cause putridity and corruption.
Approximately administer stitches at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound exposed only as much as necessary, to incise it with forceps and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
Be careful not to stretch the wound with force, for many times ignorant physicians have caused death or severe illness or amputation in their patients, as this leads to healing. If the patient's wound is loose, soft and different from the strictures of other fractures.
If the wound is large or bad and you fear the risk of a bad outcome, and pain occurs at the site, it is not necessary to place stitches there, but rather apply a hard bandage in place of stitches and tighten it with that.
When the wound begins about one or two days later, which is caused by a blow, then remove the cloth that you had placed on it and apply warm compresses, as it is our custom to treat wounds, such as warm compresses like tetrapotassium and similar ones.
It is necessary for you to remove the bandage and examine the wound every morning and evening until it is consolidated and healed, and it is important that the limb is prepared in such a way that the purulence flows from it to the joints nearby with ease.
If the wound persists for many days and is not consolidated or does not abscess from the blow, then you must realize that this is a complication of the small vessels, so examine the wound with care. If those complications that are separated and extracted do not occur, and those that are not separated and place the limb and cause pain, then you must incise them according to what is possible for you.
If the wound becomes gangrenous or rotten, this is a symptom or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary to place a poultice on one of them according to what is appropriate for its healing, which is preceded by a narrative in its chapter.
And regarding what needs the most attention and you present your case: when large bones are broken, raise the limb in the same way as the bones of the thigh and similar ones of large members, without presuming traction or extraction of it, for many times this leads to death; leave it inside until it can be moved, for a strong limb may fall apart within two to thirty days. And you take care of the wound if you have seen it, and do not leave it untreated.
Chapter XX:
On the treatment of a node that occurs in the trace of any fracture.
This node often occurs in the trace of healing from a fracture, and more frequently near joints, and it is caused by the figure of the limb; strong limbs prohibit their natural operation.
Therefore consider whether the node is recent and administer medications that have astringent properties such as alum, tannins, and others; take some or all of these, and compress them with vi stiptic or album of huou or other astringents, and place it on the node in a cloth, and press it firmly around it for good compression.
Leave the extraction that does not loosen it for many days; and remove it after the node is gone; or press firmly on a lead sheet tightly, as lead has the property of holding everything that is inflated in the limbs.
But if the node has become hard and tight and necessitates removing it constantly, then you should cut it along the most superior part of it, and excise the excess and protruding portions or remove it with forceps until it is gone; and take care of it until it heals.
Chapter XXI:
In restoration of a fracture, when it is restored and remains limb subtle and free following its nature.
When a fracture of the bone is restored, and it remains limb subtle and free, it does not happen except for multiple causes: one of which is an excess of solution of the ligament and the ligature made not according to what is needed; or due to superfluity of tightness of the ligaments before nutriment is prohibited from running to the member; or due to excessive embrocaccio [a type of bandaging or splinting]; or due to movement superfluent not in its time; or due to small amount of blood in the patient's body and debility.
And the cure of this is to feed the patient and make their heart tender before the blood is multiplied in them, and administer baths, and give warm and sweet food and comfort over him/her.
Then place plaster on the limb, so that the plaster draws to it the nourishment, or continue the bandaging of him/her with warm water, until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural shape.
Chapter XXII.
On the cure of broken bones when they are restored crookedly and the operation on them is forbidden what is necessary.
When a limb that has been restored appears to lack healing of its crookedness and prominence at the broken bone and nodule, and it is due to the shape of the member, but the limb is not prohibited from its natural operation, then you should take the word of the one who states that the limb was newly fractured.
But there are many foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land, and this operation is greatly to be condemned as leading to great fear of the sign of which death is mortal.
But if the limpness and nodule are recent, then it is necessary that they be bandaged with warm water in which are placed soft herbs soothing, such as althea leaves and razor roots, and mellilot, and similar to these; and it should be made into a plaster with plaster of mollicificatio, or the mucillage of razor root althea is prepared and rubbed with the gray of gualina or oil of camphor, and it is plastered with that; or the figs are soaked in oil and crushed with the pomegranate seeds, and similar to these of the medicines called amermans consolidation.
And sometimes it is dissolved by persistent light friction that is with the most humid, and movement of the member should be administered in all parts at all hours.
But if crookedness has already advanced far and is made strong and turned into stone and necessitated cure of it by iron, then it is necessary that the pus above be cauterized and the continuation of the bone be dissolved, and what superfluous of nodule in it should be removed with fine cutters and administered ease to him/her with solicitude and care.
Chapter XXIII.
On the speech on dislocation.
Dislocation is essentially of one of the joints of its place, which is forbidden to move, and distorts the shape of the limb, and brings pain and great injuries upon the patient.
Therefore when an accident occurs with a dislocation, it is necessary to do so immediately and not delay the reduction, for if it is delayed, the joint becomes necrotic and difficult reduction of dislocation becomes very difficult.
And for this reason, it is not good nor stretched out at the time of the necrosis, because many times brings spasms and slow pain.
But when this occurs, it is necessary that you take the flap of the patient's skin, and let it be cauterized before the necrosis subsides; and the limb should be bandaged with warm water and oil, and the reduction should be made with ease.
And all the member should be healed by the means that will come in its place.
And you have now and ordered the chapters of dislocation as it was before in the fracture; from the upper division of the body to the lower part of it.
Chapter XXIV.
On the cure of dislocation of the jaw below.
If both jaws are dislocated and not straightened; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are brought back to their places with little movement and softened a bit; or they are completely dislocated and closed, until they are mollified at the juncture until the saliva of the patient flows and he/she cannot keep it nor close his/her mouth, and the tongue of him/her is enveloped in its socket.
But if the dislocation of it is slight, then with the greatest care it should be returned to its place by itself when there is little cause.
But if the dislocation is complete and closed, it is necessary that reduction of it be administered gently, and not be delayed at all.
And the attendant should hold the head of the patient, and enter his/her thumb into the root of the dislocation of the jaw within the mouth if the dislocation is of one part; or that he/she enters both thumbs together, if the dislocation is of two parts, and the others should be outside with which he/she guides it; and commands the patient to cease his/her jaws and release them from going in any direction; and the doctor should guide the jaw and cover the jaw with a piece of cloth until it returns to its place.
If the reduction is difficult, especially when both mandibles are dislocated, then administer an emulsified solution of hot water and oil until it becomes easy to reduce both, and do not delay the reduction of both for too long, as we have said.
And when they have been returned and closed, the mouth of the patient is closed and not softened, then place it on those small pieces of woolen cloth with chalk, make it from beeswax and rubbed oil; and apply it gently to facilitate and loosen the closing.
The patient should sleep on their back, with the head placed between two pillows to prevent it from turning to either side; do not force any cause of nausea upon them; when their pain is reduced and the mandibles are in place, then you may move them as desired.
This should be administered gently and not force the opening of the mouth; you must maintain their food and drink, and rest until the mandible is set and healed.
If the reduction of both mandibles, when they are dislocated at any time and not returned to their places, is difficult, then observe carefully for fevers and constant sweating, and it is strong to provoke vomiting with pure bile.
And when you see this, you should know it is a disaster; and carefully observe that the one to whom this happens will die within ten days.
Chapter 25.
On the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and the end of the muscle.
The clavicle is not dislocated from the inside through its continuity with the breastbone; and sometimes it is dislocated on the outside, which can be determined by examination.
The restoration of this is that the patient lies on their back and extends their arms. Then compress the area with your hand with strong compression, for it will return.
And place a plaster and small pieces of cloth over it, and firmly apply pressure to that area.
However, if the end of that which is connected to it is not dislocated at any time, it should be reduced and closed as we have said and as you are equipped.
And place that plaster, small pieces of cloth and bandage over it, and command the patient to rest in quiet until healed.
This method of treatment reduces the end of the muscle when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
On the reduction of a dislocation in the muscle.
Know that a muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated from the armpit to the lower side.
And the second is that it is dislocated above the muscle, but this is rare; and it is not dislocated at the back of the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in front by the nerves.
Furthermore, it is dislocated and protrudes at the lower sides of the armpits, especially in those with little flesh, it is easily dislocated; but in those with much flesh, it protrudes outwardly with difficulty.
And a strong blow or fall can cause it to occur in some men, and the muscle of that person is cut off by cauterization, and treated with what has already been dislocated.
Therefore, you should examine this carefully before proceeding with treatment.
The dislocation of this is known when it occurs at the lower sides of the armpits; therefore you should distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the undamaged one, for there are clear signs of difference; and examine the head of the muscle for a concavity on top and the touch of its head at the end of the armpit like a hump, and when the patient cannot reduce their hand to their elbow or move it at all.
If it is dislocated toward the breastbone or inwardly, you should examine it carefully and not be misled.
The reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
The reduction of this is that the attendant raises the hand to the upper sides, and holds their hands at the lower end of the dislocation, and raises the joint upward with strength to its place, and the attendant raises the hand, and extends it upwards, and holds it there because it returns easily.
However, if it does not return by the method we have described, and the dislocation has just occurred, wait several days, and then the patient should be bathed in hot water and embrocation made of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilotus in water, and administered.
And the patient should be placed on their back and held at the lower end of the dislocation with a cloth that is neither too loose nor too tight, and the doctor should place his foot on the shoulder, lift the head of the muscle upward, pull the hand of the patient toward the upper sides so it is not displaced again, and another attendant should hold the head of the patient, who should not be displaced toward the lower sides, as it will soon return to its place.
And if you wish, reduce [the hernia] in this manner: it is that you make a man present who is taller than the patient, and he stands on the side of the affected one, enters his muscle underneath and tickles the patient's hernia, lifting it towards the incision above until the patient is suspended in the air, and another servant pulls the patient's hand from below his abdomen. If the patient is lightweight, then it is necessary that the one who causes it be suspended, so that gravity helps, because the dislocation returns quickly.
It is reduced in the same way by another method: it is that a long pole with its head rounded like the shape of a mortar pestle, neither too thick nor too thin, is placed next to the patient; then, fabric cloth lions are placed on top of the pole's head, and the patient stands according to the length of the pole, with his hand extended on one side and the other person extends his body from the opposite side with force, because the joint returns quickly to its place.
If the reduction is difficult due to all the reasons mentioned earlier, then use this cure: it is that you take a pole whose length is two forearms and its width four fingers, and its thickness is relieved at the end of the tip in this form:
Fabric cloth lions are placed over the rounded head to avoid hurting the patient.
The tip is placed next to the patient's hernia and his hand or arm is extended over the pole towards the opposite side, and the pole is tied with ropes to the helper and the end of the hand.
The arm is placed on a step of stairs according to its width, and the hand is extended towards the opposite side, while the other body is suspended from the other side, because the joint will return quickly.
Once the intestine is inserted as completely as possible in any manner that is available to you, then it is necessary that you place a linen bandage around the hernia; and apply a plaster prepared with powder of milled alum on top of the muscle, so that it is rolled over, and apply strong pressure below the hernia with a strap; and the ligament is wrapped around the plaster, and the patient's hand is connected to his neck, and it is left, and no damage should be done to the patient's hand for 7 days.
It is necessary that the food of the patient be reduced, until the member is comfortable, because it helps the healing process more quickly.
And give less food for 7 or 5 days and exercise movement; and if it is closed and not softened, then it is healed.
If the joint is dislocated several times due to humidity that occurs in it or for some other reason, then in that case, cautery with three strokes should be administered, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
And if all of this is done and the ligament is removed after 7 days and the joint is not closed, and the plaster and strap are reduced on it several times, but it is still not closed, and the catheter cannot raise the arm above the incision, then you know that the nerves of it, which are at the head of the muscle, have already been severed or extended or softened, and you should understand that the joint will never be able to return to its place.
The dislocation of that one is caused by the feet and the breast or the hips behind it, the reduction is done with a push and extension to the maximum until it returns.
Another strap should be administered in that one, and care for it until it heals.
If there is gravity or delay in the member's healing or movement, then the patient should use hot baths several times until the gravity is relieved and it returns to its original nature.
Chapter XXVII.
On the treatment of shoulder dislocation.
You should know that the shoulder joint is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; it can be dislocated in all directions, but most commonly in front of the back, and the dislocation of it is not relieved by any position or touch according to a certain shape, and when you adjust the displaced shoulder correctly, it is clearly manifested that the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor touch it with its own muscle.
And you must catch it, and reduce the dislocation as soon as possible before it becomes an abscess cauterized, because if it reaches a cauterized abscess, reducing it is difficult, and recovery is incomplete; moreover, when it occurs at the back, it is worse for all other types of dislocations, and more painful, and more often leads to death.
The restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the hand of it is extended with both arms, and the arm is stretched out, and the hands of the doctor are on the shoulder and below it, and he pushes the joint with his fingers or the blade of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in front, it returns by bending the arm with its own hand until it hits the shoulder with the blade of the palm.
If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous extension and strong motion.
And that two servants extend the arms, and let them have the same position so that there is no resistance to the extension.
Approach the arm should be rolled up entirely, as it is wrapped in long doubled cloth around its hand or bandaged.
When the doctor touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil to help alleviate the cause of pain and increase lubrication in the joint, then approach and push the joint firmly until it returns.
Then the reduction should be stopped on that plaster where there is stiffness and hardness with albumen of egg, and it should be extracted with a descending force, the arm should be suspended from the neck, and left for some days.
Then it should be loosened; and if the joint is formed in its place, then you remove the bandage from there and leave it.
If the joint is not strong, you should loosen the plaster and bandage, leave it for some days until it is extracted, then remove it.
But if there is gravity in the reduction of the joint and its position is moving, administer humectation in bathing and gentle friction, and compression, until it is alleviated; or rest on the joint for a few days, so that it can heal itself; then tie it up and leave it on the bones for the day and night. Then remove it and put it in the bath; when it becomes warm, you should massage the joint with tempered friction, and then re-apply it, which is a movement of the roller, once, twice, and thrice, Corruption has occurred inside the denouement, until it is limited.
And if you want, place it on the soft and scalded cowhide wound with sewing and press it; and do this several times, as it is wet and reduces itself to its position.
Chapter XXVIII.
On the treatment of dislocation of the shoulder joint, which is between the arm and the hand.
The shoulder joint of the hand is sometimes dislocated, and the reduction of the dislocation is easy, but on the contrary for other joints, however it requires speed in the reduction at the time of dislocation, before it becomes fixed or a cauterization occurs at the site.
The reduction of the dislocation is that you place the patient's hand joint on a table and extend their arm, then place your hand or palm over the edge of the joint, and push it back into its place.
However, it is important to consider whether the palm has already been left in the center of the hand, in which case you should place the patient's hands on a table for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is preceded by this, then you should place the patient's hand in the intrinsic position on the table, so that the doctor's hand fits over the edge of the joint.
And if it returns quickly, that is good; otherwise, press it with a plaster allowing the site to heal and leave it; do not reapply it, as otherwise, it will cause pain or you may not be able to work on the reduction for some days.
However, the joint returns according to its curvature; and do not tell the patient any cause, but let their hand become softened and unable to strengthen any cause; then know that the nerves are broken or crushed, and do not be cautious in this matter except when it is strengthened with a strong cautery for the healing of the site.
When the shoulder is returned, press it with the plaster that has been recommended, and let it be left and strengthened for 5 days; then remove it and let the patient rest and exercise their arm.
However, if the movement of the shoulder remains and there is gravity in it, you should soften it with hot water and massage it for several times until it is alleviated.
Chapter XXIX.
On the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in various parts.
And when a finger of those is dislocated at the base or center of it, you should squeeze the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumbs until it returns.
Then support the finger's head, and suspend the part to which it is dislocated, and let it rest for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it straightens on that same day.
And when it is night, let it rest according to the narrative, and do not cease to remove it during the day and exercise it with movement, and leave it at night; and do this for several days until it strengthens.
And do the same for a dislocation of the wrist, and place it in that position, and perform the same first operation until it heals.
And similarly, do as you would for when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter XXX.
On the treatment of dislocation of the spinal vertebrae in the back.
When a spine or neck vertebrae becomes dislocated and other vertebrae are also displaced along with it, that is not treatable because death awaits the patient.
A sign of this condition is that the patient's excretion is outside their will and they cannot retain it; and in many cases, some limbs or legs or arms, or one of them are swollen or affected by paralysis, or a vertebra has been dislocated from its place. In many cases, this means that the vertebra has moved and the patient is experiencing paralysis in four different areas.
Therefore, it has been dislocated in the rear area and is called sciatica. (This line appears to be an interpretation or explanation of the condition discussed earlier.)
However, the treatment of this condition is to consider whether sciatica occurs in childhood because in such cases, there is neither cure nor recovery for it. (This line appears to be a continuation of the previous explanation or interpretation.)
But in cases that occur from an accident or blow, or similar to those, the Ancients have described many ways of treatment at length, but I shall summarize it here as succinctly as possible, for brevity's sake; nevertheless, I have abbreviated this treatment method by omitting much of the detail, using more straightforward language to make the explanation clearer. With that said, I will now describe and elaborate on the instruments used in this method.
Only that type of sciatica is treated which occurs in the back, as I will recommend. (This line appears to be a conclusion or summary of the discussion about treatment for sciatica.)
The patient should be laid flat on their back and propped up with cushions or pillows to prevent the feet from touching the ground. (This line appears to describe a position for the patient during treatment of sciatica.)
A straight stick should be placed beneath the head at its foot end, and another stick under the feet at the other end of the bed. (This line appears to describe additional equipment or positioning for the patient during treatment of sciatica.)
The caregiver should hold the stick, and neither should it be fixed in place; another caregiver should hold the other according to this positioning. (This line appears to describe the roles of the attendants during treatment of sciatica.)
Cover the patient's head with a cloth and tuck it in securely to keep it from falling; extend the end of the bandage to the stick that supports the head, and tie it there; and tightly bind the other bandage around the patient's waist, covering their lower back, and make sure the sheets are straight; and adjust all the bandages so they are tied together to the stick that supports the feet. (This line appears to describe further details for positioning and securing the patient during treatment of sciatica.)
Approach the minister and extend the ligament to the division of the thigh, but do not let the two thighs and the ligaments in their places where they are inserted remain unbound, but rather loosen them slightly, but not as firmly as has been said.
The doctor places his hands on the spine with strength until it returns (or he places a board over that area and adjusts the patient's feet onto the board until it returns).
However, if it does not return in this way, then take a board whose length or width is three cubits, and carve into the wall near the patient a hole in which to insert the end of the board. Then the thickness of the board is placed on the spine and the doctor places his feet on the other end, and squeezes it tightly until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
If you wish, turn the patient's head to the side; and you should place your feet behind his head at a distance of one forearm, and the distance between each foot should be a palm, and make a hole in each foot, firmly planting them on the ground so that they are not injured.
A fourth foot should be placed in a circle where the two feet meet.
And at the end of it is a hole where the foot is placed, its length being one palm around what is turned (or curved); and in the other feet, it is similar to that.
Then tighten the ligaments that you have tied around the patient's feet at the hole where his head should be, and the ligaments that you have tied around his thighs at the circle where his legs should be.
You must place each turn and have a minister who rotates the turn with his hand, and the doctor examines the spine as has been said.
When the spine has returned and the hole is closed, it is necessary to place a medicated plaster with hog's lard and stopper over it, and then place a board of the size of three fingers or slightly larger over the spot where the swelling is, and the length should be that which covers the swelling, and on top of the division of the spine.
And tie a linen cloth with the ligaments that we have mentioned, and use the patient for subtle nourishment until he is cured.
And if there remains any obstruction in the spot at the end of healing, it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and smooth with the long-term administration of the board, which we have recommended; and already a sheet of lead has been applied to that spot.
Sometimes there occurs obstruction in the lower back of the two (spines), and it is caused by dislocation; and that bone that protrudes should not be approached with this medicine because it will cause you to die quickly.
Chapter XXXI.
On the treatment of a dislocated pelvis.
Know that the joint of the pelvis and the joint of the muscles do not move except for dislocation alone, and it does not happen at those joints as it happens with other small displacements and depressions.
And the joint of the pelvis is dislocated in four ways: it can be dislocated at the internal divisions, or at the external divisions, or at the front divisions, or at the back divisions.
Moreover, it is most often dislocated at the internal divisions, and rarely at the front or back divisions.
The sign of the dislocation at the internal divisions is that when you adjust the healthy thigh with the sick one, the healthy thigh is longer and the sick leg is more prominent than the healthy one, and the sick person cannot bend his knee; and the location where the thigh should be joined has been marked with a cauterized apostema, so that the head of the thigh has already reached this point.
The sign of the dislocation at the external divisions is that the accidents at that location are opposite to this accident.
The sign of the dislocation at the front divisions is that the thigh spreads out in compliance, but does not bend without pain in the front, and if it is forced to walk and cannot advance towards the front; and the urine is retained and the opening of the bladder is cauterized, and you should have the patient walk on crutches.
The dislocation of the part (hip) in that person can be recognized by the fact that the thigh does not expand, nor can it bend the affected limb as it doubles into the socket, and the socket is shorter than the other, and the hip is softened, and the head of the femur should be directed towards that location.
However, the reduction of that type of dislocation you consider, if the dislocation is old and chronic, it has already been accustomed to its position, in which case, you do not need to perform a reduction; therefore, it is not a complete cure; and therefore, it is not necessary for progression (of treatment).
If the dislocation is recent and one of the four types of dislocations, then you must aim at returning the joint and extend it between the thighs inside and outside, to the left and right, so that it returns easily without needing other treatment.
If it does not return in this manner, you must then prepare a strong tool and extend the socket of the thigh lower down, or use a rope that is tied above the hip; and another person extends their hand above in such a way as to place their hands deeper into the hip joint; and hold tight with the rope near the base of the femur, and have another person keep the end of the rope taut.
The extension is made from the thigh to the hip joint at the anterior part of the neck or from the back part of the thigh to the back part of the chest.
The extension should be performed in one continuous movement, with the patient raised off the ground and hanging down.
This type of extension is common to all four types.
Therefore, if the dislocation returns in the manner described, it will be good; otherwise, it is necessary for all types of dislocations to do what I have said about their own treatment.
In the reduction of this type, when it is dislocated and the dislocation is inside the thighs, the patient should be placed on their back; and the ropes are stopped at the base of the femur in the area between the head of the femur and the lower neck of the hip; and then extend the rope from the front part of the hip to the more anterior part of the chest.
And another strong person takes hold of the arms, and grasps the large part of the diseased thigh and extends it outwards by forceful extension, as it returns to its place.
And this type is easier to cure than other types for which this member can be reduced.
However, if the patient is too weak to comply with this type of treatment, it is necessary to tie both their feet together with a strong, light rope around their ankles and thighs.
And let the length of each be four fingers, and the diseased thigh should be extended more than the other by two fingers.
And the patient is suspended over the head of the bed, and it should be elevated as much as possible; and the distance from the ground to the patient should be two forearms.
And command a strong young person to press the head of the femur, and suspend the patient from another young person, and have another young person push on the hip with force, as the joint returns to its place quickly.
However, in the reduction of this type, when it is dislocated outside the thighs, the patient should walk on crutches as recommended earlier; and the rope is tightened around the hip of the diseased person and their feet.
And two beds should be placed, one under the feet and the other under the head; and two more beds adjusted to the middle of the pole fixed over which damp cloths are wrapped around it, so that the patient is not damaged by the pole being between their legs, so that the extension at the back should not be obstructed.
And each person extends to their part, and the doctor with his hand guides the reduction according to art.
And when the dislocation is in front of the thighs, it is necessary to gently extend the socket and according to the story mentioned earlier on the pole; and the doctor places his right palm over the neck of the hip, and then compresses it with the other hand, and this compression stops the extended hip at the front part of the thigh near the groin.
And if the dislocation is behind the thighs, it is not necessary to extend the patient's leg backwards and elevate it above the ground; instead, it must be placed on a hard surface as if the ankle of the foot is dislocated outwards, as described earlier in the treatment for that purpose, and it should lie on its side and the ropes should be extended as described, but there will be no benefit.
It is necessary to administer compression with a table at the joint location.
Therefore, when the reduction is difficult as required - and the sign of its difficulty is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend two blankets for the patient, and when you see the patient's thighs narrowing and the patient stretches their own leg and expands it without excuse, then you know that the member requires reduction - and then you adjust two cushions and wait with plaster, pulling gently so as not to harm any of the parts; and let the patient rest for three or four days.
Then loosen the linens and plaster, and compare one blanket with another.
If you see the thighs returning to their normal position, then know that the dislocation is closed, and leave the patient to move freely.
If you see any signs of swelling, then return and bandage it, and pull it gently according to the first structure, and leave it for three days.
Then loosen that, and make it walk slowly for several days, until it is comfortable.
Chapter XXXII.
On the treatment of dislocation of the shoulder.
The shoulder can be dislocated in three ways: it can be dislocated at the exterior joints, the internal joints, and more often at the posterior joints; but not at the anterior joint.
The sign of dislocation is when you ask the patient to apply their arm to their chest, and then you know that the shoulder is dislocated.
The restoration of all the types of dislocation is to place the patient straight, so that they can extend their arm if possible; hold your hands on the side of it, and press the foot of it between your feet; and bring the shoulder towards your palms, and keep those in position on the shoulder until it returns to its place. And another servant should extend their own leg into the shoulder of the patient until the shoulder returns to its place.
The sign of reduction is when the arm adheres to the chest without laboring.
Then bandage it and make the arm adhere to the chest, and tie them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then loosen the bandages.
Do not let the patient walk for several days until he is healed and comfortable.
But if the reduction of it is excused, then administer strong extension with linens as described in the treatment of hernia in the previous narrative.
Chapter XXXIII.
On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle is sometimes reduced by slight movement, and sometimes it is dislocated due to injury, and the dislocation of it can occur inwardly or outwardly.
The sign of dislocation is that you see the ankle swollen on the side where it is dislocated.
But the treatment of reduction is gentle, and it should be extended easily and then retracted until it returns to its place.
But in the treatment of a dislocation caused by injury, it is necessary to place the patient straight, and have a strong and able servant on the side of the back of that in the right position.
Place your right hand on the top of the patient's foot and your left hand on the part below the foot at the location of the heel.
Push the foot towards you with your right hand, place your left hand on it twice and stretch it, then push the foot's leg towards the bed with your right hand.
Do this twice as you have counted.
Push the foot's leg to the bed on the third count, and you are at the heel.
If the foot returns after one or two counts using this method, that is good; if not, continue the procedure, for the foot will return again.
But if reducing it using the method that we have recommended is prohibited, then make the patient lie down on their back on solid ground, stretch out a piece of cloth on the ground and have them lie between it, and you have already wrapped them in cloth to avoid injuring the patient.
Have the minister (assistant) hold their (the patient's) legs, and have another minister extend the foot with their hands or place it on a pillow so that it rests on the neck of the foot; and have each minister extend that part of the body in the opposite direction, while the cloth remains between the patient's legs to prevent the body from being pulled apart at the sides beyond its extension.
And the doctor straightens (reduces) the dislocation with their hands, and another minister holds the healthy limb at the sides, for the dislocation will return easily.
And so when the dislocation returns and the reduction is confirmed to you, then stop applying the plaster and remove it firmly, and tie the foot to the bed.
It is necessary to be careful or protect the nerves that are behind the heel, so that the bandage on it is not too tight and does not hurt the area too much.
Leave it like that for two or three days; if the bandage becomes soaked, remove it.
Remove the bandage on the third or fourth day, and prohibit the patient from walking for forty days. But if walking in front of that space is necessary, it is not certain that the dislocation will not be resolved and destroyed, and this would not receive treatment.
If an abscess is discovered, it is necessary to provide care in the manner described earlier (in the procedure), at another location for treatment and dressing, until it has drained completely.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocation of toes in feet.
It is necessary that one who is dislocated be reduced gently with slight extension; and if it is not difficult, it should be done easily.
But if the dislocation is in one of the toes of the second toe (the two smaller toes), then it is necessary to restrain the patient's foot on a level surface, such as the ground or a table, and keep it still as if he were walking.
Then stand by the patient's foot, and place it on something that supports the joints, and press it with your foot firmly until it returns to its original position, and make sure it remains stable and does not appear in the affected area again.
Then place the patient's leg on a table that holds the entire foot, with two ends, and press it firmly with a structure of appropriate strength and stability for three days; then loosen it and let it rest from walking for several days until it is strengthened and the recovery is assured.
Chapter 35.
On the types of dislocation caused by wound, fracture, or any other conditions simultaneously.
When some cause of these occurs, and you engage in the treatment and restoration of it, many times death follows.
Therefore, it is not necessary to approach the treatment presumptuously, but one who is skilled in the art, with long experience, mercy, and compassion, should proceed slowly, neither hasty nor presumptuous; and use remedies that stop pus cauterized only when necessary, leave the patient to divine judgment, but help those for whom you hope salvation from destruction and alleviation of illness, and in which there is some hope. And thus strive to reduce it at the beginning of the cause before pus forms a cauterization.
And if the member returns as we wish, then administer treatment that stops pus cauterization and heals the wound with what is appropriate for dry dressings.
And if the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and the bones are separated, you should perform the treatment for their setting, and do what has been said in simple illnesses before these locations.
And be careful and cautious with the instrument in the paths of fear as you have been taught by my preaching; because it is better for you to follow your Creator, and more permanent to your glory, and more healthy to your true body those things at your time. Thus ends the words of Albucasis may God be praised. Amen.
