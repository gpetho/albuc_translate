Chapter Thirty-Eight:
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When the bladder becomes weak and softened due to cold and humidity, causing the patient to be unable to hold their urine, then cauterize the lower part of the bladder, where the pubic hair starts, with one cauterization on the right side and another on the left side.
The length of each cauterization should be the size of the joints of the fingers; also cauterize the lowest part of the back, or with two cauterizations if necessary.
The cautery should be nail-like, as previously described.
