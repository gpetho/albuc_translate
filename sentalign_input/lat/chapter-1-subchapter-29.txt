On the method of cauterizing in cases of pleurisy.
Chapter 31.
The ancients said to use cautery with roots of aristolochia for cold pleurisy in the following manner.
Take a long, dry root of aristolochia, selecting the longest available, approximately the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and ignite it in fire.
Then apply one cautery at the point where the furcula meets the neck, and two smaller cauteries slightly downward below the chin.
And also apply two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, slanting slightly towards the back; one cautery at the center of the chest and another over the stomach.
And apply three cauteries on the back: one between the shoulder blades, and two on each side of the chest, below the cautery placed between the shoulder blades.
Do not press your hand too hard with the cautery; instead, it should only be obvious enough by the smell of the burning skin.
Some of the ancients have said that certain practitioners use an iron cautery similar to a rod; they heat it, insert it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, and let the discharge exit, as we mentioned in the case of a liver abscess.
But with this procedure there is a risk: either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops at the site, which is incurable.
