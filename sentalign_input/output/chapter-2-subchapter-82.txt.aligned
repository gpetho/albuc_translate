Formication is a small false sensation around the body, and goes very deep; and sometimes the cold finds it, and it feels like a shivering death, and comes all over the body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.	A pimple is also a little compact thick prominence on the skin surface, going deep; when it gets cold there is a feeling as of an ant's sting in it. It is found all over the body but mostly on the hands.	0.7231532
And the treatment is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place this quill on the shivering, so that the circle surrounds the shivering completely; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the shivering, and push it deep, and pull out the shivering by its roots.	The treatment is to take the quill of a strong feather of the goose or the vulture, and place the quill over the pimple so as to encircle it with the circumference of the tube; then revolve the quill with your hand so as to cut all round the pimple, and go deep into the flesh, and then the pimple may be drawn out by the roots.	0.89656615
And if you wish, make this with a quill of brass or iron according to this shape, and let it be thin underneath and cutting on top:	If you wish you may extract it with a tube of bronze or of iron, of this form. The upper closed part of the tube should be fine, solid, and twisted, to give easy purchase for the fingers in holding and revolving it.	0.60527825
not pointed, so it can be held in the finger, and pressed.  And if you wish, cauterize the shivering, as described above in the chapter on cautery.	The upper closed part of the tube should be fine, solid, and twisted, to give easy purchase for the fingers in holding and revolving it. If you wish you may cauterize the pimple as described earlier on the cauterization of warts in the book on the cautery.	0.5813247
