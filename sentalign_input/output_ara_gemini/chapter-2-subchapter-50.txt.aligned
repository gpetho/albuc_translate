Chapter fifty on the swelling that arises from the twisting of a nerve.	CHAPTER FIFTY. On the tumour arising from the twisting of a tendon.	0.7604042
Just as a swelling may occur in an artery or vein, so too may it occur in a nerve, whether due to a blow or from excessive fatigue or similar causes.	As a tumour arises on an artery or a vein, so may it also come in a tendon when it has been bruised; or it may arise from excessive fatigue, or such causes.	0.8665832
This occurs most frequently in the wrists and heel, and in every place where joints move. It is a protruding swelling, its color similar to the rest of the body, and it is most often painless. If pressed firmly, the patient feels a kind of numbness.	This occurs mostly at the wrists, at the heel, and at all sites of articular movement. It is a hard tumour of the same colour as the rest of the body, and is generally painless, and when strong pressure is put upon it the patient has a numb feeling in it.	0.8985064
The swelling is not located deep within the body, but rather under the skin. It moves in every direction, yet doesn't go forward or backward.	It is a tumour that does not form in the deeper tissues but is subcutaneous. It is freely movable laterally, but will not go forward or backward.	0.80464184
So those that are in the joints, it is inadvisable to treat with iron instruments, for it may cause chronic pain.	Those that are situated on joints should certainly not be tackled with the knife, for that often causes palsy.	0.6359497
And as for those that are on the head or forehead, incise the skin with a scalpel.	Incise the skin of those occurring on the head or forehead, and if the tumour be small take hold of it with the forceps and cut it away by the root.	0.56894505
If the swelling is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it off at the base. If it is large, hook it with a snare, peel it off, then extract it and close the wound with sutures, treating it until it heals.	But if it be large, catch it up with a hook and dissect it away and remove it; and sew up the incision and dress until healed.	0.6842923
