of castration	On castration.	0.5506375
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book; and it is only necessary for two reasons: one is that the physician should know how to answer when asked about it, and know the treatment; and the other, because we often need to castrate some animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.	Castration is forbidden in our law and I ought therefore to make no mention of it in my book. But I must speak of it for two reasons. One reason is that it should be part of the doctor's medical knowledge when asked about it, and that he should know how to treat anyone whom it befalls. Another reason is that often we need to castrate certain animals for the sake of the benefits that accrue from them, such as rams, he-goats and cats, and such animals.	0.89137614
I say then that castration is done in two ways: either by pulling, or by cutting.	So I say that castration can be performed in two ways: either by contusion; or by opening up and cutting away.	0.8775524
In the one that we do by pulling, we make the beast sit in hot water, until the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand, until they are drawn back and you no longer feel them.	The method by contusion is that we make the animal sit in warm water until his testes are relaxed and become soft and pendent; then rub them with your hand until they are so loosened that they are no longer palpable.	0.8217735
