Chapter Sixty-Eight
On the Relaxation of the Scrotum.
Often the skin of the scrotum relaxes in some people without the flesh inside it relaxing, and its appearance becomes unsightly.  So, whoever wishes to treat it should have the patient lie on his back.
And he cuts all the skin that has relaxed to the thick skin, then brings the two edges together. And if you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches and make sure of the stitching, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of all other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
