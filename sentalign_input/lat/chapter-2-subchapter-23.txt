On the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter 23.
We have already explained the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for perforation with explanatory words, so take that same understanding according to its health benefit.
Then you should make the patient sit squarely between your hands, facing the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, tightening it firmly: then hold the eyelid of his eye with your right hand if the eye with water is the left eye, or with your left hand if it is the right eye.
Then take the almagda in your right hand if it is the left eye, or in your left hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the end of the almagda near the coronal area by the thickness of the radius in the white of the eye visible in the lesser lacrimal region: then press the almagda forcefully, rotating your hand along with it until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel that the almagda has reached an empty space.
And the depth reached by the almagda should be the same measure as the space from the pupil to the edge of the dark area: which is the coronal area of the eye.
For you will see it in the pupil itself with the vision of the eye, due to the clarity of the corneal layer.
Then place the almagda to the spot where the water is located.
Then press it downward repeatedly, one time after another.
If the water descends immediately, then the patient will immediately see what he opens his sight to, and the almagda in his eye.
Then rest briefly.
If the water descends, then lower it a second time, except for removing the almagda.
When it is fixed and does not rise up: then extract the almagda carefully, while gradually rotating your hand.
Then dissolve some clear rock salt in water: and wash the eye internally with it.
Then place over the entire eye some tow or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white: and bind it over the healthy eye.
However, we and those of our time place ground cumin with egg white over it.
If the almagda does not enter the eye because of its hardness, as there are people whose eye is very hard: then you must take a spatula called the Alberid, which has this form.
Therefore, pierce only the conjunctiva with it, and do not push your hand deeply into the hole: this is only to create a path for the almagda in a narrow area.
Then insert the almagda as we have described.
At the completion of your procedure, prepare a properly arranged sleeping area for the patient, where he will lie on his back in a dark room: and he should be prohibited from all movements, and from coughing: provide food that calms his nature: and he should not move his head to the right or left at all.
And let the bandage remain in place until the third day.
Then remove it in that dark room, and test his vision: and let him see things.
Then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
And he should not do it at the time of treatment, nor immediately after the incision: rather, you should remove it, because the water ascends quickly with intense vision.
If a warm abscess appears: then you should release the eye before the seventh day: treat it with something that reduces the abscess, until it subsides: then expose his sight, and place a covering on his face to moderate his vision for several days, while he remains in that dark room.
Then he may gradually leave the house and move about in his dwelling.
And know that in zaltea a student is not exempt from sight sometimes: then indeed he may dare to proceed with the operation.
And indeed we have heard from some of those from Alayrach, who said that in Alayrach there was an almagda with a perforation by which the water is drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this: nor have I read it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is something new.
And these are the forms of the different types of almagda, so that it may be understood by those who are unfamiliar with it.
They should be properly made of metal: with their ends finely shaped in a triangular form, and the tip should be sharp.
