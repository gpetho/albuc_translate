Chapter 7:
Restoration of a chest fracture.
The chest sometimes breaks in the middle and this often happens; but its edges are very often crushed and fragmented.
And one of the accidents of a middle fracture is that it leans inward, causing great pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, and often spitting blood; this is evident in the cavity of the broken bone and is not hidden from feeling.
The restoration involves having the patient lie on their back and placing a cushion between their shoulders; then press the muscles, adjust the ribs with hands on both sides, and work gently in the operation and alignment in every possible way until the bone's shape is restored.
Then place a plaster and wool on it, followed by a thin wooden splint made of willow or similar light wood, wrapped in cloth; gently bandage it over the broken bone so it does not move; wrap it round the back several times, and tighten it decently; check the bandage regularly and tighten it when it loosens.
If a need arises to remove the bandage due to erosion, itching, pain, or abscess, quickly remove it, clean the plaster, rectify the situation with appropriate treatment, and then replace the plaster and tighten it until it heals.
