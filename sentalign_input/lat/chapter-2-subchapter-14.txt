On the treatment of Alxatrati occurring in the lower eyelid, which is a wrinkling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati, which occurs below, is what is truly called Alxatrati.
And it can be either natural or accidental.
Accidental Alxatrati results from a wound, a cut, cauterization, and similar causes.
The procedure for treating it is to take a needle with a double-thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left tear duct to the right tear duct until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then, stretch the flesh upward with the needle and make an incision with a broad spatula.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to what it should be, this is good.
If not, take a thin rod, insert it into the fissure, and rotate the eyelid with it. Then make two slits on the inner side of the eyelid, with the ends of these two slits meeting at the two corners of the incision until they converge to form an angle. When they come together, they should form a shape like the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that portion of flesh that is beneath the sharp edge of the eyelid.
Then bring the separated parts together and sew them with a wool thread.
Then treat the area with the softening medicines mentioned before, and with linen strips, until it heals.
If Alxatrati results from a fissure, suture, or cauterization, you should make a shallow incision beneath the eyelashes, as previously described.
Then separate the two edges with a linen strip, as we have explained.
In summary, the treatment of Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, involves a procedure tailored to the shape of the Alxatrati.
For it presents in many different forms, and the skilled practitioner will prepare the technique in whatever way possible to restore the shape to its natural form, or as close as possible, taking into account the patient's specific needs, operation, and the tools available in many different situations.
