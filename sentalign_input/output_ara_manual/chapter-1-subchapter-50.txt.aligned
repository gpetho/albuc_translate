If the cancer is in its early stages and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it as you rotate. Some physicians have mentioned cauterizing it strongly in the middle, but I do not recommend that because I expect it will ulcerate, and I have seen that happen several times.	When the cancer is in its initial stage and you wish to arrest it, burn all round the circumference of the cancer with the circular cautery. Some doctors have said that it may be cauterized with one extensive cauterization in the middle. This hardly seems right to me, for I should expect it to ulcerate out; which I have several times seen.	0.8564676
The correct way is to cauterize around it in a circle as we said, or with many cauterizations.	So it is correct to burn around the circumference with a circular cautery as we have said, or with multiple cauterizations.	0.7972187
