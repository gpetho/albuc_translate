Chapter Thirty on the Treatment of Dislocation of the Vertebrae of the Back
When a vertebra of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment for it because death comes quickly to the patient,
And a sign of this is that the patient's stool comes out involuntarily, he cannot hold it, and often some of his limbs become relaxed, either his legs or his arms, or one of them.
But if one vertebra is displaced from its position, it often shifts, and its shifting can be in four directions, and the one that shifts backward is called a hump.
And as for its treatment, you should observe: if the hump occurred from childhood, there is no treatment for it, nor any cure at all.
But as for the one that occurred from a fall or a blow and the like, the ancients mentioned it with various kinds of treatment in lengthy discourse, most of which is not beneficial, and I have summarized from that what little suffices for much of what they brought, from my approaching the meaning and my explanation of it, and I have depicted the instrument differently from what they explained and illustrated.
So I say that the hump that occurs from the front in the chest, there is no remedy for it, nor any cure from it, and likewise the one that is to the two sides also, but only the one that occurs in the back is treated, especially with what I am describing.
It is that you lay the patient on his face on a level bench near a wall and spread a soft padding under him so that his chest is not harmed, then you place a standing plank planted in a hole in the ground at the end of the bench towards his head, and another plank towards his feet at the other end of the bench, and an assistant holds the plank, and let it not be fixed in the hole, and another assistant holds the other in that manner, then you wrap around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft, tight bandage and extend the end of the bandage to the plank that is at his head and tie it there, then you tighten with another bandage over his hips and over his knees and at his ankles, then you gather all the bandages and tie them to the other plank that is at his feet, then each assistant pulls the plank towards his side with the bandage, and the two planks do not move from their planted positions except that they are not fixed as we said, and the physician places his palms on the vertebra with force until it returns, or he places a board on it, then he leans on the board with his feet until it returns.
If it does not return with this treatment, then you take a board whose length is about three cubits and dig in the wall that we said should be near the patient a place into which the end of the board is inserted, then you place the middle of the board on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls well until he presses the vertebra and it returns to its place.
And if you wish to do it with the screw that is turned by hand, it is that you plant in the ground at the patient's head at the end of the bench two planks whose length is a cubit, and at his feet at the end of the bench also two planks, and let the distance between each plank be a span, and a hole has been made in each plank in which the screw runs, and all the planks are well fixed in the ground so that they do not move at all, and you insert a rounded stick, which is the screw in which the bandage is twisted, into the holes of the two planks, and at its end is a hole in which a stick a span long has been fixed with what it twists, and in the other two planks the same.
Then you tighten the bandage that you tightened on the patient's chest in the screw that is at his head, and the bandages that you tightened on his legs in the screw that is at his feet.
Then an assistant stands at each screw, turning his hand with the turner with which the screw is twisted, and the physician straightens the hump as we have described.
And this is a picture of the screw, the bench, and the patient:
Then, after the vertebra returns and the place becomes level, it is necessary to apply the dried dressing with egg white.
Then the scarification.
Then you place over the dressing a splint from a board whose width is three fingers or so, and its length is as much as it takes up the place of the hump and on some of the correct vertebrae.
Then it is tied with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he recovers.
If some protrusion remains in the place at the end of the healing, it is necessary to use the medicines that relax and soften, along with the use of the board that we described for a long time.
And a sheet of lead may be used for that.
And a protrusion may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation, and it is an extra bone that has protruded, so do not treat it with this treatment, for death may occur.
