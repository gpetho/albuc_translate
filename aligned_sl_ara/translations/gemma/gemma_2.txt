This book is completed for those who have not yet finished it. This book is part of the science of medicine and its completion has reached its end with regard to its knowledge of herbs and their explanations. I have seen that it is appropriate to complete it with this article, which is part of the work of the hand.
Since the work of the hand is honorable in our land and our time, medicine continues until its knowledge is studied and its effect is discontinued And indeed, there are simple figures remaining in the early books which the hands have corrected and reality has refuted, until they were abandoned after their usefulness had ceased
I have seen that it is necessary to illuminate and explain these matters, and to summarize them, and to bring together the images of all the works which relate to this, for it is an increase in explanation and a reduction of what is unnecessary.
The reason why there is no skillful surgeon in our time is that the art of medicine is long and requires that its companion precede it in the science of anatomy, as Galen described it Until one stands on the benefits of the organs, their ailments, their temperaments, and their connections and separations, and the knowledge of bones and nerves and muscles and their number and their joints and veins and arteries and their ramifications.
And thus Hippocrates said, "There are many physicians in name only, but few in deed," and we have mentioned this matter in the preface to this book
For one who is ignorant of what we have mentioned concerning anatomy is likely to fall into error which may cause the death of people, as we have seen many instances of this in this science where people were deceived by their lack of knowledge and were attributed to ignorance or incompetence
When I saw a foolish physician who had split a swelling of a porker in a woman's neck, I took hold of some of the neck vessels and bled her until she died in his hands.
I also saw another physician who attempted to remove a stone from a man's bladder who had been stabbed in the side. The stone was large and he could not remove it, so he cut out a piece of his intestines along with it.</start_of_turn> A man died three days later, and I had recommended that the stone be removed. I saw that the stone was large and that the cause of death was not that.</start_of_turn>
I also saw another physician who was boasting about his medical skills among the people of our land.</start_of_turn>
He saw a black slave who had a fracture in his leg near the heel with a wound, and the most skillful physician among them put a plaster cast on the fracture over the wound with strong bandages and did not leave the wound to breathe.</start_of_turn
Then he left him for a while and when he came back he found that his leg had swollen and his foot had become black and swollen and that he had perished.</start_of_turn
I called for him and he quickly untied the bandage, but the pain had already subsided and the swelling had increased, and the limb had become blackened. I was unable to do anything to save it.</start_of_turn>
The decay continued to spread in the limb until it perished.</start_of_turn>
I saw another physician who was treating a cancerous tumor and the patient died after a few days. This was because the tumor was black pus-like and should not be exposed to the needle of the scalpel.</start_of_turn
If it is in a limb that contains all of it.
If it is in a limb that contains all of it, then know that the work of the hand is divided into two parts: work that brings safety and work that is alongside the medicine in most cases.
In such a situation, know that the work of the hand is divided into two: work that promotes safety and work that accompanies the medicine in most instances.
For the layman will not know the way to speak or the cutting, so take care of yourselves, for mercy and composure will not be found except through gentleness and composure.
And use the best way that leads to safety and praiseworthy treatment, and fear only serious and dangerous diseases that are beyond control
Beware lest you incur suspicion in your religion and your worldly life, for this is the greatest abomination and most profound offense in the world and the Hereafter for your worth
As Galen said in some of his sayings: "Do not think that you are a bad physician because you do not cure every disease; for there are some diseases that no physician can cure.
This section is divided into three parts.
The First Part.
In the tenth century AD, surgical texts such as Albucasis's book and images of instruments are arranged in this section to illustrate the work of the hand in surgery
The Second Part
The second part includes sections on fractures, wounds, amputations, and the removal of arrows and other similar procedures, all of which are illustrated with images of instruments
The Third Part
In surgery, fracture treatment and wound management are included, all of which are systematically arranged from the tenth century onwards and illustrated with instruments.
Chapter One.
On Surgery.
Before we mention the work itself, it is necessary to mention the instruments used in it and the dangers and precautions associated with them in any context
I say that the discourse concerning the benefit of surgery, its dangers and precautions is long and detailed and requires great knowledge and profound wisdom, and many scholars have spoken on it
They differed in their approaches, and some of them have abridged their discussions for fear of making them too long
I say that surgery is beneficial in the whole of every bad condition that exists with or without material, whether it is the hot temperament without material or the cold temperament without material
As for the cold temperament with material, there is debate among some scholars as to whether surgery is beneficial or not. Some say that it is beneficial, while others say that it is not suitable for diseases caused by heat and cold temperament because of the nature of fire and cold temperament
Among the scholars, there are those who believe that surgery can cure diseases caused by hot and cold temperament with the aid of hot and cold medicine. Others disagree, claiming that surgery is not suitable for such diseases because fire and cold temperament are their nature. Since fire is added to the body and moisture is subtracted from it, when fire and cold temperament meet in the body, there is a conflict between them.
I say this because experience has shown me that this is the case many times, and it is not appropriate to generalize based on this The variations in people's temperaments and the nature of diseases in their bodies, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
And as for the remaining temperaments, there is no fear of them for you, nor particularly the damp and cold diseases, as all doctors are unanimous in their benefits and there is no difference among them in their efficacy.</start_of_turn>
Know that the secret of effective treatment lies in the fire and its fuel, which is the drug. For fire is an independent essence that does not pass its effect to any other part except the one that it burns, and does not harm anything connected to it except when necessary for its continuation.</start_of_turn>
The drug applied with fire may extend its effect beyond the organ and perhaps cause disease in another organ that hinders its treatment, or even death. The fire, however, with its honor and noble essence, does not do this except when compelled to do so.</start_of_turn>
Perhaps this has become clear to us through experience in the course of our service and the attention to the industry and the fixing of facts.</start_of_turn>
And so we have abridged the lengthy discourse and, although it is not appropriate for this book to delve into such mysterious and sophisticated knowledge, we have mentioned it to you briefly and explained its efficacy in the body and its refutation of diseases with philosophical arguments supported by proofs that reflect your understanding.</start_of_turn>
Know that they have differed in the time in which the beneficial effects of the drug reach their peak and make them the best of their kind.</start_of_turn
And I say that the drug has reached its peak in every age, for the damage caused by time consumes the benefits that accompany it.</start_of_turn> Especially if the disease is of an urgent and powerful kind that cannot be delayed, for fear of its exceeding the benefit that results from the drug itself.</start_of_turn
No disease can be cured without its cause being eliminated.
A disease cannot be cured without addressing its underlying cause, just as a physician eliminates discomfort by regulating humors and drying up moisture, which are the causes of pain.
The best remedy is the one that is quick, strong, and powerful in its action
The disease may return at a later time depending on the temperament of the patient and the nature of the disease, which is caused by an excess of humors or a deficiency of some of them.
The remedy must be specific to the type of disease, gentle in its action and specific to the affected part of the body, which is affected by excessive or deficient humors. For example, if the pain is caused by an excess of phlegm, its elimination will definitely cure the pain.
However, the generality of the physicians is that the physician's remedy is of no use after the cause has disappeared.
The physician's remedy is not useful once the cause of the disease has vanished. The generality of the physicians is misleading in this regard.
Perhaps they mentioned earlier that the physician's remedy is better when it is general rather than specific, because of its nobility and refinement, and they did not mean that it is not effective in its place.
Since I have already experimented with it, I have found that it is effective in some organs but not in others. It is better than iron as they claim. If you protect the coals of gold from the fire with gold, you will not understand when they are protected.
It is quicker with cold and if you apply it to fever, it melts in the fire and is excreted by the patient from the work of the hand. So the blacksmiths among us have made it faster and more accurate than before God willing.</start_of_turn>
I have arranged this section in the book in chapters which are sequenced from the head to the foot, in order to make it easier for the student to grasp what he wants from it God willing.</start_of_turn>
Chapter One.</start_of_turn>
In the chapter of the head there is one method.</start_of_turn
This method is useful for excess of moisture and heat in the brain which are the causes of headaches, excessive sleepiness from the head to the eyes, ear pain and toothache, and sore throat.</start_of_turn And for every disease which shows from cold such as fever and stiffness and numbness of limbs and yellowing of the skin and swelling of the spleen and other like that.</start_of_turn
The image of this method is that it should be given in small doses at the beginning, and after three or four days according to the strength of the patient and his age and condition should be repeated.</start_of_turn
Then you must make him drink from a mug of water, then sit between his hands and place your hands on his chest.
Then put the heel of your hand on the bridge of his nose between his eyes where the middle finger does the action with the pen.</start_of_turn
The safety of the abdominal cavity must be ensured in this situation.
The bone must be exposed from the tip of the rib or from the base of the kidney. Remove the hand with the needle and do not return it to its original position, but rather replace it with another hand or use another method if necessary.</start_of_turn> Until you see the bone as described, take something of salt and dissolve it in water and drink it. Soak cotton wool in it and put it on the place and leave it for three days.</start_of_turn>
Then put on it a soaked bandage in fat and leave it until the abscesses are gone and then apply ointment liberally until it heals, God willing.</start_of_turn>
Some people say that when the wound remains open, it is better for the pus to drain out than for it to remain closed.</start_of_turn>
And some of them say that it is good to soak the skin in the bone and keep the area covered until some of the bone has charred, and then remove what has charred and treat the rest.</start_of_turn>
Others say that one should be generous with the incision until it has a strong effect on the bone, so that it breaks from the ribs like the sparks of a torch or small fragments, and they claim that this releases from that place the smoke of the head and leaves the wound open for a long time.</start_of_turn>
Then treat it until it heals. I have not seen these two methods of treatment in some people except on the road to madness and leaving it with them is better, and with praise if the head is relieved when its natural connection is broken as I have seen in other organs.</start_of_turn
Especially when the head of the bone is weak by nature. The first method is good and better for me. Use it and do it peacefully if possible.</start_of_turn>
Chapter III.
In the head also.
If anything happens in the head and makes it prolonged, that is an increase in the swelling and the use of cataplasms, plasters, saffron, unguents and especially if one of the cavities has been fractured, it will not be of any use. Ask If the head is slightly weak and the structure is strong by nature and was not weak, and if there was an intense cold there, he would put another cavity over that little one Then he would put over every angle of the head a cavity until the skin goes white and the bone becomes visible as much as the cavity we described. And put a cavity in the back of the head in the place which is called the vault and loosen the hand in this and do not uncover the bone, for if the head is slightly weak and the structure is strong by nature and was not weak, and if there was an intense cold there, he would put another cavity over that little one. And I will mention this cavity in its place
And the cavity which is put over the horn of the head and the back of the head should be less thick than the cavity which is put over the middle of the head, and this is its form.
Chapter III ends here.
In the uncomplicated case.
If anything happens in the part of the head and makes the headache and the swelling extend to the eye, let the skillful physician evacuate the head with purgatives and use all the treatments which have been mentioned in the sections on diseases and if that does not happen there is an opening in two faces either with strong medicine or with iron
If the painful area is on a bone, take a nail and hammer it into the bone at the site of the pain, then break around it from both sides with pliers. Then split the skin at the site of the pain with a broad knife until there is a subcutaneous space that can hold a nail.
Insert it under the skin until it disappears, then tighten it firmly and bind it securely. Leave it in place for five or six hours, then remove the nail and leave the wound for two or three days before dressing it.</start_of_turn>
The wound should be kept moist with ointment until the area is healed. Then it should be treated with an antiseptic cream as described in the twentieth chapter on antiseptic medications.</start_of_turn>
As for the specific technique for this procedure, refer to the preceding section.</start_of_turn>
It is called a needle block because it has a head like a nail with some teeth in the middle and a small head.</start_of_turn>
Then place it on the site of the pain and hold your hand firmly while rotating the handle slightly, and the amount of tissue that will be numbed is about half of the thickness of the skin.</start_of_turn Hold your hand firmly to prevent any bleeding from the underlying vessels, then soak a cotton swab in saline solution and place it on the site and leave it for three days.</start_of_turn> Then bandage the area and apply an antiseptic cream until it heals.</start_of_turn
If you wish, you can also tie this small vessel at the side of the needle block to prevent bleeding from this vein which is not significant in this area.</start_of_turn
Chapter Four.
In the case of a chronic wound.
If the wound has been treated with the advanced treatment mentioned and the diseases mentioned have been measured, but the treatment has not improved and the expert does not see what he should do with the first dose of medicine or the like of it. Then the black ointment should be covered until it whitens after learning its place on the pain with a line of its length equal to half a finger or so, and leave the hand for one turn and tighten until the artery is cut and reaches the bone
And do not forget to protect the jaw that moves when biting opens the muscle or the nerve that moves it in the occurrence of tension
Be cautious and vigilant of bleeding from the artery that has been cut if indeed it has been cut Especially if he is ignorant of what has been done and has not been trained and leaves the work first
And it will be mentioned later how to stop bleeding from the artery in its place, God willing, and if the expert does not do what is mentioned of this knowledge.
And the body of the patient is covered with a bandage as described previously and the wound is treated until it heals if God wills.
And if you wish to use the ointment mentioned in the chapter on the artery covered with two cushions, it is better than this and will make the treatment better.
Chapter Five
In the case of earache
If something has happened in the ear and it causes pain and other treatments mentioned above have not helped to remove it, then know that this is the point of this ointment.
Then, when it is fully covered with silk, drain the wound after surrounding the ear with all its circumference or around it entirely if the pain is there. Then, when it is fully covered with silk, drain the wound slightly from the root of the ear after learning the position with the probe. The dose should be ten points in each ear or thereabouts, and then treat the points until it heals, God willing.
Section VI.</start_of_turn>
On the edge of the wound.</start_of_turn>
The wound which is treated with the dose that is of the kind which occurs from mucus as mentioned in the sections on diseases.</start_of_turn>
And it avoids the dose of the kind which occurs from abscesses and injury to the nerve.</start_of_turn
When this kind of dose is treated with astringents and soaks and compresses, it does not cure the disease. In this case, it is necessary to increase the dose to three points.</start_of_turn> One at the root of the ear, the second slightly below the suture line, and the third at the junction of the lips.</start_of_turn
And make the dose strong against the diseased side because relaxation occurs in the healthy side.</start_of_turn
The dose should be formed with a triangle whose apex is at the upper part of the ear under the chin slightly and another at the suture line and its length is as long as the thumb.</start_of_turn
The dose descends with your hand until it reaches half the thickness of the skin. This is a soaked dose, and it is the kind of ointment that has been mentioned previously and which is not much different from this one.</start_of_turn The surgeon should exercise caution and only use a moderately thick dressing, then treat the area as required until it heals, God willing.
Seventh Chapter.
In chronic wounds
If you have delayed the wound and treated it as mentioned and it has not healed, and you do not feel heat in it, it is four days since the wound became infected. On every side of the head there is a wound and in the middle of the head as we mentioned and a wound in the hair of the head as it progresses.
The dressing should be changed as it progresses, and it may also become loose from the teeth of the gums and be painful, then treat as required
Eighth Chapter
On amnesia.
The one who is suffering from mucus should be treated with caution or with large doses of medication or drugs for the brain.
Then he should be shaved completely and carried on his back, and mustard plaster is written in the wound and repeated as many times as necessary until he is struck from the evil
Do this at the bedside with the one who is sick, as we mentioned previously. If the patient does not recover after three days, there are four wounds on the back of the head, which are like mountains on the head.
And make between each wound and the next a thick finger, then treat the wounds as required. If you desire to increase it, and the patient is able to tolerate it, remove the middle wound
If you desire to increase it, remove two nails and treat until it heals, and put olive oil on like the way it progressed
The Ninth Chapter.
Chapter IX. In the case of swelling of the organ and relaxation of the entire body.
It is necessary to advance the tongue with instruments as we have mentioned previously, then clamp the lower jaw, and insert a sponge or vessel between the upper and lower jaws and on each side of the head and at the back.
And place two fingers on the cervical vertebrae, for if the swelling in the body is more than this, the patient is likely to be restricted by it and the patient is strong and steadfast, so insert four fingers behind his back ...until it turns pale from the skin and raises your hand, then treat him as we have mentioned until it subsides, God willing, and be liberal with the olive oil plaster
The Tenth Chapter
Chapter X. In the case of strangulation
When the patient is strangled by fluid, which has been caused by mucus, it is necessary to remove the obstruction from the throat first of all with large instruments and perform all the treatment which we have mentioned previously, if the lesion is small and the patient is not restricted, but if the lesion is large or the patient is restricted in his breathing, it is necessary to take medication immediately
...for if the patient is a child and cannot tolerate medication, do not perform the large incision and excision of the clot before a number of days, and improve his diet.
Then clamp the lower jaw and insert a sponge or vessel between the upper and lower jaws and at the back of the head. And insert a sponge or vessel on each side of the head, and if the patient is strong and restricted insert four fingers behind his back on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back, and be liberal with the olive oil plaster on the lesion which has progressed
If the lesion is in a young boy, make a smaller incision on this image.
If the lesion is in a young boy, make a smaller incision on this image.
If the lesion is in a young boy, make a smaller incision on this image.
If the lesion is in a young boy, make a smaller incision on this image because if the cause of the lesion is viscous mucus and thick pus, we have mentioned the needles in the owner of the wound.
If the lesion is in a young boy, make a smaller incision on this image because if the cause of the lesion is dark and the body of the boy is moist, it does not reach the brains from what is advanced in dissection.
Then tighten the head of the boy, then make a tight knot from silk thread and pass it through the center of the head and the boy's feet will be bound together, holding from every side, and take one cubit of alum.
Then tighten the head of the boy, then make a tight knot from silk thread and pass it through the center of the head and the boy's feet will be bound together, holding from every side, and take one cubit of alum. Then burn it with moderate heat as much as it can tolerate and throw it into the middle of the head in the circle and leave it until it cools down. Do this every week once with all the other treatments until it heals if God wills
And if you see that the incisions are coming out in many small pieces without holding your hand with the incision, consider that a sign and do not be hasty in that kind of incision as it causes bleeding in the brain with caution.
And then put on him a soaked compress of gum or in chicken fat.
If the lesion is in a young boy, make a smaller incision on this image.
If the lesion is in a young boy, make a smaller incision on this image because the wound is leaking into the eye
If you notice that water has begun to flow into the eye with the signs mentioned in the classification, then immediately pour a small amount of alkali over the pupil. This will prevent its head and edges from being softened by all the moisture and will leave them firm in the bath for several days.
Then moisten the pupil with a loop, covering half of the head and leaving the rest uncovered. Then cover the central area with two loops and the corners with two loops on either side if both eyes are affected, or one loop if only one eye is affected.</start_of_turn>
Then cauterize all blood vessels and nerves under the skin and let the loops remain in place to protect from bleeding.</start_of_turn>
If you see anything of the above, cut it out from its place. And take counsel in regard to the vessels and nerves, and cauterize them to prevent bleeding.</start_of_turn>
There may be two bulges under the bones at the corners.
Chapter Thirteen.</start_of_turn>
Regarding chronic watery discharge.</start_of_turn>
If the discharge from the eye is chronic and has been present since birth, and if it is from the blood vessels outside the head, then it is from excessive cold and fat that has increased in size. The central loop and two loops on either side of the head and two loops at the corners of the eye, and if necessary, increase the size of the loop on each side of the eyebrow with a small cautery.</start_of_turn
Chapter Fourteen.</start_of_turn
Regarding the discharge from the nose.</start_of_turn
If treatment fails as described in the classification, then perform three incisions: two at the lateral angles of the orbit and one in the middle of the face, below the oil gland. Then close the middle incision with sutures, two above the eyebrow and one below the scanty hair, taking care not to damage the arteries, which is the proper technique.</start_of_turn>
Fifth portion.
For the relaxation of the eyelids.</start_of_turn>
If the eyelids relax from disease or moisture, make an incision in the crescent shape of the moon.</start_of_turn>
And if you wish, make two incisions above the eyebrow slightly below the bridge of the nose and distant from the sutures, and the length of each incision is along the eyebrow.</start_of_turn
Do not make the incisions too wide, but as much as the third of the skin should be removed. This is the proper technique for this incision.</start_of_turn
Sixth portion.</start_of_turn>
For the eyelids.</start_of_turn
If their edges have turned inwards in the socket, there are two types.</start_of_turn Either the yellow [disease] or the oily [disease] kind. If it is the yellow kind, make an excision before that, if possible, until the edges are straightened and equal.</start_of_turn
If the membrane is adhered to its socket, it will drag the eyelids downwards. Therefore, if it is possible, remove the membrane before that, until the edges are straightened and equal. If it is removed and straightened, place the tip of the needle under the edge of the eyelid and mark with a sign in the shape of a sheet of paper.</start_of_turn
The initial sign is close to the opening of the wound. Then, one should place under the fold a small piece of moistened lint in the yolk of an egg or in the saliva of a dog. Then, cover this with a dressing.
Then, keep it covered as you have been shown many times until the surface of the skin becomes like a piece of paper that has been carefully scraped and has a special appearance. This is a sign of health and that your work is correct. You will see that the edge of the eye has become taut and the hair has become raised from the edge of the eye.
Remove your hand for a while and leave it for three days. Then, apply a bandage until the swelling has gone down. Finally, apply ointment until the wound is healed, God willing. If some hair remains after that and the fold of the eye is relaxed
Do it in the same way as before. If there is hair remaining at the lower edge of the eye, remove it until it returns to its natural position and do not pluck out the hair of the eye. As for the ointment, order the attendant to leave the wound open until it is healed
Then make of the bandage a piece of paper and take from the known soap and unrefined gypsum of each one as much as the weight of a dirham or whatever you like and mix them all together and do it quickly lest it dries out. Then spread it over the bandage which you have made like paper and put it on the eye or eyes and put under the eye a small piece of moistened lint in the yolk of an egg and the head of the attendant in your pocket.
Put your index finger on the ointment and press it slightly. Keep moving it whenever the attendant feels a tingling sensation because it feels like fire. As long as there is tingling, leave the ointment and move your finger. When the tingling subsides, withdraw the ointment and wash the eye with water
If you see that the eyelids have become elevated, as when inhaling fire or in cutting, do not apply any remedy until you have performed treatment in the area which has not been affected by the remedy and where the ailment has not subsided. Continue treatment until the work is completed and the eye is closed, and then apply the pressure of the thumb until the spasm subsides.
Continue treatment with the aloe or other remedies until it heals. Be cautious when working, as any residue of the remedy should not fall into the eye. If the eyelids relax after a few days and some hair has fallen out of the eye, it is normal
So apply the remedy once again in that area which relaxed specifically as you did the first time, and then continue treatment until it heals, and this is an image of the bandage.
Note that people's eyes are different in size and shape, so be careful and do not deviate from the correct path in this industry
Chapter Seventeen.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the signs of intoxication in the eye.</start_of_turn>
If you treat the intoxication as mentioned in the sections on diseases, do not expect the treatment to be successful unless you address this issue.</start_of_turn
The patient should place his head in your lap and you should keep his head supported between your hands, lightly grasping his hair without causing him pain.</start_of_turn
Then put a wet compress on the pupil or on the iris of his eye, and cover the eye with a bandage like this image.</start_of_turn
The eye should be like the wing of a rooster, curved from one side and straight from the other, or like the plum of an olive if you wish, or like the spindle if you wish, but this method is best for your work, God willing.</start_of_turn
If the wound is open, drain the pus until it stops flowing. If the wound is closed, open it and drain the pus. Then apply a compress and hold it in place with your hand until it reaches the bone.
After that, keep your hand somewhat away from the eye towards the nose so as not to touch the eye or cause any concern, and apply the compress to the wound until it reaches the bone. If it reaches the bone at the first attempt, do not apply the compress once more if necessary.</start_of_turn>
Leave it for three days, then apply a bandage soaked in unguents and cover it with a dry dressing until it heals. If after forty days it has not healed, give him strong medication until the bone is exposed and join it as described previously, God willing.</start_of_turn>
And as for the other side of the wound mentioned previously, describe the location of the wound, then place over it a cushion of this size and shape.
...and put over it a weight of lead wool soaked in vinegar and hold the cushion firmly in place with your hand without moving the lower part of the limb excessively, for fear that the vinegar should reach the eye and cause harm. Place over the eye a compress made of white wool or cloth soaked in vinegar or water.</start_of_turn>
If the lead wool causes pain in the location of the wound and heals, leave the dressing as described previously. Otherwise, if the wound heals without the need for these measures, do not make another opening in the nose or perform any other procedure in its place.</start_of_turn>
Chapter Eighteen.</start_of_turn>
On the wound of the lip.</start_of_turn>
Many wounds occur in the palm of the hand, which is known as a hair wound, and frequently occur in the hands of children. If treated without proper care, these wounds will not heal and will become infected with small abscesses.
The wound is opened on the edge of the abscess and the dressing is placed over the wound until it reaches the depth of the wound, and then it is treated with silver until it heals, God willing.</start_of_turn>
Chapter Nineteen.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the treatment of wounds in the mouth.</start_of_turn>
If there is an opening in the mucous membrane of the tongue or in the cheek or in the roots of the teeth and there is swelling and pus and blood, and it is from a chipped tooth, then treat it by extracting the pus and applying pressure to the wound. If treatment is not given, it will not heal and infection will result, so it is necessary to apply an antiseptic dressing to the wound.</start_of_turn>
Then put a dressing over the wound and hold the thumb until the edges are protected by the dressing and the rest of the fingers and do this once or twice, and then treat it as mentioned previously until it heals, God willing.</start_of_turn
If the tissue has been separated and has healed, and there is no need to uncover the place and remove the fractured bone, then do so as will be explained in the following chapter, God willing.</start_of_turn
Chapter Twenty.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the treatment of fractured bones and soft tissues.</start_of_turn
If the soft tissues have been stretched by swelling and the bones are fractured and treated with medication but have not healed, put the thumb over the wound and apply pressure to the wound until the swelling subsides, and then put the bandage on the tooth.</start_of_turn
Insert the translation here.
He inserts the sponge immediately and grasps it lightly until he feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth. He then raises the hand and repeats the process as desired. He then fills the cavity with salt water.
The acute and twenty-fourth parts.
In order to extract the tooth
If the tooth has been affected by cold or there is pus and no treatment or medicine has been administered, the cavity contains two faces: either the greasy face or the fiery face.
Or the greasy face is to take pure fat from a cow and put it in a basin of iron or a pan, then take a piece of cotton and wrap it around the end of the forceps and smear it with fat and put it on the aching tooth and grasp it until it cools down.
Then repeat the process until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. If you wish, you can also smear saliva or cotton in cold fat and put it on the tooth and cover it with a protective barrier until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth
Or as for the fiery face, it is to make a tube of brass or iron and there will be some charcoal in it. Then put the sponge on the tooth and grasp it until it cools down. Repeat the process until the heat of the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.
And if the pain persists, either for this day or another, it is necessary after that to fill the mouth with good salt water and grasp it for an hour, then throw it away. This is the image of the sponge.
The skilled surgeon should consider all possible approaches and choose the most appropriate technique, for this is an image of a tube.
The tenth.
In the abdomen
If the intestines are filled with bile and cold moisture and have not contracted with medicines and require immediate contraction, we must support the abdominal cavity, for this is the picture of an extended loop.
So that the smoke comes out at the other end, place it protected on the swelling once more, until it reaches the depth of the swelling. If the swelling is small, make a support on the amount of the swelling
Then leave it for three days and place on it a wet compress in the evening until it goes out, and then apply ointment and dressing until it heals, God willing
The eleventh
In the abdomen with a sound of wind and tight chest
If moisture has overcome the chest rib and especially if this is with cold temperament, then let him vomit first or administer laxatives, and then form a pouch of silk at the root of the ribs in the lower position
Beware that the tube does not reach the throat and does not burn the skin except for half, and then put another pouch at the nape of the neck at the end of the groove with bile and be a support on the side that advanced.
Then leave it as mentioned until it heals, God willing.
The twelfth
In the chest of a lung and throat disease
If the sputum and lung disease are caused by cold humors and there is no inflammation or swelling, and the illness is chronic, then make incisions over the carpal bones and another in the middle of the chest between the nipples.
The incisions should be made as described previously, and if you wish, make the incisions so that they resemble the shape of a hook, and the point of the hook should be pointed towards the side.
Then treat it as described above until it heals. A triangular dressing is made with three wings on this shape and it is fixed with three knots, and this is the shape of the dressing.
Fifth and twenty-eighth chapter.
On the carpal bones.
If the head of the radius dislocates due to soft humors or does not settle firmly when returned to its place, it will usually slip again whenever movement is attempted, as was seen previously. Therefore, if the bone is displaced, or if it has slipped, it is necessary to reduce it again Then grasp the limb with the palm facing upwards or to the right side, and elevate the skin of the inside of the elbow over the fingers of your left hand if the dislocation is towards the inside
Then make a dressing with two pads of this shape
Then fix the skin until it is completely covered with the dressing, and make a shape of the limb with four corners, and there are three bands on the neck of the dressing.
This is the shape of the dressing with three bands.
If the wound has increased to the extent that there are eight stitches, then support the wound with needles carrying salt and maintain the tension without moving the part until it has healed, even if the fracture is above or below.
If the wound has increased to the extent that there are eight stitches, then support the wound with needles carrying salt and maintain the tension without moving the part until it has healed, even if the fracture is above or below
The sixth and twentieth parts.
In the abdominal cavity.
If there is cold and much moisture in the abdomen until it evacuates from its belly and the number of boils increases, and there are treatments for them, then do not lie down and rest on your face, but elevate your legs and arms and then resume your position with three stitches A wound under the armpit with the size of a thumb and two below the flanks of the wound, until the form of the wound becomes triangular and further between them so that if it is closed, the depth of the wound is a third of the thickness of the skin and the shape of the wound
Like this and no more
And if you wish, make a large wound in the middle of the abdomen like this
The wound will be circular in shape like this on this image
The abdomen can be closed with needles and sutures without cutting from this wound, and you will learn on the abdomen where you want to make a mark with the needle, then make a mark with the needle and suture it, and treat the wound until it heals
Seventh and Twentynth Chapter.
On the Treatment of Cold Abdominal Pain.
If the liver becomes cold and causes pain, accompanied by swelling or the emission of a foul-smelling discharge, it should be treated with a natural purge that will evacuate the morbid matter. This is to be done without causing further harm The physician should place a compress on the abdomen and teach the patient to apply three fingers on this area below the ribs where the spleen terminates.
And after each finger and a half, the liver should be gently massaged with the palm of the hand without causing any pain.
Do not strain the skin more than half its thickness. The patient should sit upright, and if he is not upright, he should be supported by placing his legs on a stool and raising his arms. This is the position of comfort
You may also use the abdominal compress that we mentioned previously, if there is relief and calmness in the industry and preservation of life, without causing any damage to the skin of the abdomen or the intestines
Eighth and Twentieth Chapter
On the Swelling of the Liver and its Pain
If there is a swelling in the liver and pain, one must learn whether it is in the liver itself or in the pericardium. If it is in the liver, the physician should apply pressure and teach the patient to do the same.
If it is in the pericardium, the pain is severe and the physician should apply pressure and teach the patient to do the same.
The wound is protected from fire and is similar to a wound caused by a nail. It is protected by a single layer until the entire skin is burnt out and the gut is exposed until all its contents have come out, and then it is treated with cautery until it heals.</start_of_turn>
This is a kind of wound that should not be attempted except by a skilled surgeon who has experience with these types of cases. Many patients have died from attempts to treat this wound.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 92.</start_of_turn>
On the wound of the nail.</start_of_turn>
The initial wound was described with the application of cold lancets to this kind of wound, which is that you take of the long thorns one that is longer than you find, and make it thick like the nails, and then immerse it in oil and burn it.</start_of_turn And it is protected by a single layer between the ligation of the esophagus with the nape of the neck and two small ones below the navel and two large ones above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.</start_of_turn
And two more below the fifth and sixth ribs slightly inclined backward slightly, and another in the middle of the chest and two below the navel and three behind one between the shoulders and two below the elbow down to the wound which is between the wrists.</start_of_turn
It is not permissible to immerse your hand in the wound but rather on the surface of the skin to protect it. Some people say that some people used to put nails resembling nails made of iron in the wound and put them between the ribs until they reached the same abscess.</start_of_turn
The wound emerges as mentioned previously in the liver tumor, and in this case it is treated by cautery from the surrounding area, or else the cause of death may ensue within a short time, or it may display in the place a swelling that does not regress.
The wound comes out as mentioned previously in the liver tumor, and in this case it is treated by cautery from the surrounding area, or else the cause of death may ensue within a short time, or it may display in the place a swelling that does not regress.
The wound emerges as mentioned previously in the liver tumor, and in this case it is treated by cautery from the surrounding area, or else the cause of death may ensue within a short time, or it may display in the place a swelling that does not regress.
If the disease of the liver is treated as mentioned previously in the division of treatment, then neither treatment will be of benefit to you, for there is in each of them three or four sutures along the liver.
The shape of the liver wounds which progress in shape and there is between every two wounds as much thickness as the span of a thumb or more or less, and the color is pale as that which is mentioned concerning the wound of the liver, whether it be that it does not darken the hand placed over it or the image of the cause of the wound being visible on the back
The other side is in the flank and the elevation of the liver where the cause of the wound ends, and the elevation of the liver where the left flank of the wound ends and the skin is raised over the width of the body so that the sutures are along the body
Then enter two protected spatulas until they reach the skin on the other side, and then come out pale, and there will be four wounds, and if you wish to suture the other, there will be three sutures in addition to the four existing ones
Then the wound is treated in the place after it has been left to swell for a long time, for this is what will make the rest of the treatment ineffective.
The Severe Wound of the Thirty
In the case of severe infection.
The specific antidote for infection is application of zinc ointment. In this case, four layers should be made around the wound and one layer on the abdomen
One layer on the liver, one on the spleen, two on the back between the ribs, one facing the chest and one facing the abdomen. The depth of the layers should be close to the thickness of the skin, and then leave the wound open to allow drainage for a long period of time.
Do not neglect any treatment after the wound has been closed, and mix the poultices that are useful for the patient. The salve which is applied to the back should be bitter in taste and the one applied to the front should be oily
The Second and Thirtieth Chapters.
Regarding the foot and leg wounds
If swelling occurs in the wound and is filled with yellow fluid, it should be treated by applying pressure over the joint between the metatarsals and the phalanges of the foot
Keep your hand steady and do not remove the dressing, then raise your hand and do not put it back down until yellow fluid stops dripping.
Apply two layers on each leg, one layer under the knee and another below it, and on each thigh two layers should be applied.
Leave the wound open without treatment for a long time until it drains naturally, then treat it with all the methods mentioned previously.
The Third Chapter on Splints and Bandages.
In the matter of treating pain...
If the pain is from bruising and swelling, up to the weakening of the forces that are in the abdomen and the chest, and the treatment for this is by application of treatment, but if that does not suffice and you see a little of the wound closed, and the power is lost, then know that there is a great force on the abdomen ...and four forces around the secret of the wound on the circumference of the large intestine, and a force on the loin above the great vein or two forces on the flank below the ribcage.
If you see the swelling and the little wound closed, then know that there is a force on the flank and the loin and perhaps two forces on the abdomen more than the large intestine. This is a successful treatment that does not go wrong by the will of God
The Fourth Chapter on Sutures and Dressings
In the matter of drawing up the wound...
If there is abundant swelling in the sitting position, or if it is from thick and cold pus or foul discharge, then do not neglect treatment, for we mentioned in the division that if there is no treatment, the little wound will become large like a dog's head. The treatment is by making three forces on the lower part of the loin under the flank, somewhat like the teeth of a saw
...and a force under the secret with two fingers, and if you think the abdomen has become cold and the food has not digested, and you see the face pale, then know that there is a great force on the abdomen. Make a force on the abdomen and two forces on the flank ...and another on the top of the wound with a large dressing and leave the wound open for a while, then close it when it has healed, if God wills
Chapter Fifty-five.
In the treatment of wounds.
After cutting it out if the vessel has been cut, grasp the cautery and pass it into the same vessel and tie it up with the thumb and index finger. Do this once or twice.
If there are many wounds, cauterize each one as described above and then treat them with the appropriate remedies until they heal. If the wound is large on the abdomen, be cautious in its treatment.
Chapter Fifty-six
In the treatment of fractures that are in a sitting position and their surrounding areas
If there is no displacement or work in the place described and the limb is only fractured, perhaps it will heal by itself. If, however, there is displacement of the fracture or swelling and discharge of pus from the wound, it is necessary to measure the fracture with a flexible ruler
Then determine the degree of displacement of the fracture with the ruler, grasp the cautery and pass it into the fracture and tie it up with the thumb and index finger in a position parallel to the fracture. Leave the measuring device in place until all of the pus has drained out once or twice or thrice as much as you need
And take precautions against burning the nerve if there is one or great swelling and if the fracture is close to the hip bone or the abdominal cavity
The opening of these areas is permissible only if the fracture is not displaced and has not penetrated, then treat the area until it heals. If the area is closed and the material is left in place for a long time, know that it has healed completely
If no material remains, know that the fracture is displaced or the bone is fractured or something similar is the case.
Seventh-thirtieth section.
In the kidney area.
If something occurs in the kidney and it becomes painful or odorous and there is a lack of urine, it is necessary that the bladder be placed over the kidney which is painful. Perhaps three kidneys are involved, and they are all connected together, so that three kidneys are placed side by side and this is more beneficial
Eighth-thirtieth section
In the bladder area
If something occurs in the bladder and it becomes weak and relaxed and there is no urge to urinate, it is possible that the bladder has become fixed in the lower belly below the navel and that the hair of the belly and the flank of the belly have become displaced from their normal position
And it is placed below the thumb of the hand on the lower back or two, if necessary, and it is surrounded by a protective covering on what has been mentioned previously.
Nineteenth-thirtieth section
In the womb area
If something occurs in the womb with regard to cold and wetness, it becomes fixed with regard to the cord and becomes fractured. This necessitates that three kidneys be placed around the navel as we mentioned previously concerning the bladder area And the kidney is placed below the loin on the lower back or two, and it is surrounded by a protective covering
Twentieth section
The wound has closed.
The wound has closed. Moisture may collect in the surrounding tissues, causing them to bulge outwards and indicating that the limb is longer on the other side. If some of the tissues have been pulled out, there will be an empty space in the place of the fracture. The edges of the wound should be approximated as close as possible to each other, like a circle.
Once the bandage has been applied around the limb and the limb is rotated to be in the center of the circle, the wound will be approximated in a circular fashion. If this approximation is not performed, three large olive-sized knots will remain untied.</start_of_turn>
The limb should be maintained under pressure until the entire thickness of the skin has been passed over and the pain has subsided, God willing.</start_of_turn>
The four hundred and twentieth section.</start_of_turn>
On the leg of a woman.</start_of_turn
If there is an opening in the thigh and the cause is cold and moisture, and the wound has been approximated as mentioned previously, but the treatment has not been applied and the time has passed, it is necessary to facilitate the flow of bile from the gall bladder or to have patience and endure the pain.
Then tighten and face the limb over two blows or apply blistering medication or heat and ice, and the ice should be placed on the face of the limb. Many of these methods should be used together. Three of them are like this image.</start_of_turn
It should be kept under pressure until the distance between each finger and the next has become thick. There should be a circular approximation on the head of the thigh. If you like, four knots can be made like this on the circumference of the wound.</start_of_turn
The wound should encompass all parts of the limb and burn through the entire skin, for this is the characteristic of the female’s vein if the pain is constant for the limb itself but does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, it is like two veins on the thigh at the place that indicates the cause of the pain and a vessel above the popliteal fossa with four fingers and a slight elevation and be equal in size to the skin thickness only.
If the pain extends toward the heel, it is like three or four or more [varicose] veins if necessary, and if the pain is under the knee toward the leg, there is one [varicose] vein.
And preserve in all these veins that they do not reach the bone or large vessels, for this would cause a bad mark or discoloration of the area
I have seen one or two similar cases where a vein burst above the popliteal fossa and in the thigh, causing swelling of the limb down to the foot and discoloration of all the parts, and then tetanus and death ensued. If the pain is in both legs, all of them are like this in this respect.
Some scholars among the physicians have mentioned that these veins are like iron nails, and their diameter is half a barleycorn, and there are three nails inside, one of which is large and two are small.
There are two nails between each pair, and their height is towards the thumb and index finger, and they take on the shape of an iron fist that has become tight around the nails
If the wound is small, it is protected in the fire until it becomes white and then placed on the outer side of the thigh and supported on the sound side. Three stitches are then made in one operation and the wound is left open for three days.
Many times it is treated with ointment until it heals, as this book writer has stated. This type of dressing is less harmful and less painful than other methods, as it is more tolerable and less likely to cause pain at the site of application
As for the scorched medications, they are made of a vessel resembling a bowl, into which are placed the contents of the bellows or iron nails.
The height of the container is two fingers or something similar. Between these is a space of the thickness of the thumb and index finger, and it is open below and closed above. Some of the contents are covered with some of these containers on this manner
Then it is placed on the outer side of the thigh and supported on the sound side. The hand is grasped firmly and the wound is covered with water from the thermos and the mustard plaster, and it is fixed for an hour and a quarter. The thigh is patient with its pain and burning, for if it finds pain like fire, it will be burned.
Until the pain subsides, then grasp the hand with the instrument and wash the thigh thoroughly with water. Then leave it for three days and apply the ointment until the burn is gone and the wound is healed.
Then it is treated with ointment until it heals. If the pain persists in the thigh or leg, they say: "If you apply water to the thigh, do so with caution." And this is the nature of the harsh water that has been proven in the treatise on medicinal preparations
Take from the salt of the galleys and from the gypsum that has not been burned out of each one a part and mix them together. Put them in a new vessel that has a small hole at the bottom through which the liquid will drain out. Put under the bottom of the vessel another vessel containing a mixture.
Mix some salt from the galleys and some unburned gypsum from each of them. Mix them together and put them in a new vessel with a small hole at the bottom to drain the liquid. Place under the bottom of the vessel another vessel containing a mixture of water. When the water covers the mixture with its fingers, grasp it with your hand and leave the vessel until the strong water has drained out of the bottom vessel. Collect all the liquid together and pour it over another vessel of gypsum and salt once more.</start_of_turn>
If in some instances the force of the afterburn is great and does not yield in many medical procedures and for various organs, because of the action of the fire, and some of the remedies that are used for stiffness such as saffron, honey, gypsum and soap mixed together.</start_of_turn>
Galenus narrated a story about an ancient physician who treated a wound of the groin and the scrotum and the great bones of the thigh without any other treatment and claimed that it healed in one instance.</start_of_turn>
Until perhaps he brought in a green olive and went out of the bath healed. If there is no olive, he will take some vinegar and mix it with oil and put it on the groin or the leg or the thigh.</start_of_turn>
Close the vessel for three hours or as long as the patient can bear it without discomfort, and then bring him into the bath. If he cries out in pain, take him out of the bath and apply the remedy once more.
If it is agreeable by God, know that no one should employ these medicines until after the body has purged itself. Dioscorides has mentioned that the extract of goats' urine is beneficial if consumed with the urine of women.
These methods are to be employed only after the body has purged itself. Take wool and soak it in olive oil, then apply it to the deep place between the thumb and the index finger, up to the bone. Then take the urine of a mature goat and drink it.</start_of_turn>
Keep applying the fire until it becomes burnt, then place it on the wool and leave it until it has cooled down. Then take another one and do not desist from this treatment until the sensation reaches the middle of the limb and the pain subsides in the name of God. This method is called the 'peptic medicine'.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 42.</start_of_turn>
In the section on treatments for backache.</start_of_turn>
The pain in the back may be due to various factors such as a fall, a blow or excessive vomiting. In this case, only the 'peptic medicine' is suitable.</start_of_turn>
The medicine which is of cold substances should be administered after vomiting has ceased. It should be applied to the back, where the pain is, in three rows along the intestines. Each row should contain five doses of the medicine, or more, according to the severity of the case.</start_of_turn>
The dose of the medicine should be three or four doses of the medicine, along with an intermediate dose of an irritant.</start_of_turn
The Third Chapter and the Veins
In the manner of initiating the circulation.
It is frequently observed in young children and is a sign of its beginning that when they do any action or movement, there is tightness in the lower part of their back, and that in the end of their lumbar region there is a swelling which has appeared and spread over all the other swellings
If you see it and you wish to stop it, grasp it with a bandage which is circular about this form to take the swelling in all directions from the vertebrae, and if you wish to make a complete encasement around the vertebrae, do it with a bandage of three points and make the points close to each other, and then treat the position until it is healed as we have mentioned
And preserve that you use the hand in the treatment of the condition which is from tension of the nerve.
The Fourth Chapter and the Nerves
In the manner of the nerves and the joints' pain
If the pain of the joints is from cold humidity which has spread to any part of the body, and if the pain occurs in the legs, it is usually called special paralysis
If the cold paralysis has not relieved the pain, then the hand should be used for treatment as we mentioned previously, and should not be done until after the swelling has subsided from the knee joint, and that it should be treated with many compresses and with an intermediate oily bandage about this form
And if you are forced to cut on the face of a man, do it with a bandage of three points, and if the pain has ascended to the knee or to any other joint, and it is frequently observed in this, grasp the three points of the bandage with the hand which is oily and has been mentioned before
If the pain extends beyond this area, do not grasp the hand firmly but rather keep it only lightly supported. If the pain ascends to the abdomen or back, use the method mentioned in the previous chapter.
If the pain is only in the hands, pinch around the fingernails as one would a rope. If the pain remains in the fingers, pinch at every joint and the base of the thumb. If the pain later extends to the forearm or elbow, use the method mentioned previously.</start_of_turn>
Grasp them from all sides but do not use excessive force. Give time for the medicine and diet to take effect. If this does not relieve the pain, vomiting and flatulence may aid in healing with this treatment, God willing.</start_of_turn>
The fifth and fortieth chapters.
When the wound is complete.</start_of_turn>
If an incision has opened up in the abdomen and some intestines and fat have protruded to the exterior, and this is in its early stages, it is permissible to order the patient to abstain from food for a day and to use laxatives to evacuate the bowels from his belly.</start_of_turn
Then place your fingers between his hands on his back and order him to grip until he vomits the fat or intestines, then grasp them with your fingers and teach him to pass the catgut under the incision at the bone below the navel, similar to half of a circle with its ends pointing upwards on the body.</start_of_turn
Then cover this position with a blanket.</start_of_turn
Until the white bile has healed, then vomit the intestines or fat into the belly. The servant should place his hand on the patient's thigh and the patient should pass the catgut under the incision at the bone below the navel. The servant should also place a sheet under the patient's legs and another servant should hold his legs.</start_of_turn
If there is swelling on the chest, he grasps both hands and lets the cautery rest on the mark itself and grasp the cautery with the hand and keep it steady until it reaches the bone or repeat the process if it does not reach the bone on the first attempt.
Beware lest the gut protrude during the procedure, for this may cause harm. Know that if the bone is not reached despite your efforts, your work has not been successful. It is better for the cautery to be fine for the small intestines and coarse for the large intestines.
Then, after three or four days of rest, apply oil to the wound and cover it with herbs until it is healed. The cause of the wound should be treated on the back for forty days until the wound is closed
...and make his food bland during treatment. Otherwise, when he moves and breathes, the gut may protrude. If he wishes to do anything after forty days, he should use a bandage and keep it bound for another forty days and reduce his food and drink intake and his crying and excessive movement
...If he follows this treatment, he will surely recover completely, God willing. As for the wound which is on the surface of the body, I will mention its treatment in the chapter on wounds, God willing. As for the wound which is in the abdomen and is new, if you wish to prevent it from becoming larger, do not make the incision too wide. ...Leave a third of the skin unburned, then close the wound with what we have mentioned. Some people say that a cautery of the same size as this is sufficient for this case
Once you have learned about cautery and its technique, make a vertical incision above the wound and a parallel incision below it. Insert your cautery between them and grasp it with your hand, keeping your hand steady
Sixth Forty Chapter.
In the management of wounds
If some organs suffer from fracture or injury and swelling persists despite treatment, then it is necessary to apply a dressing to the point and manage each organ according to its size, position and strength.
Pain and swelling can also be prevented by early treatment and adequate care of the primary lesion. Otherwise, they may spread to neighboring tissues and organs, so it is necessary to follow them until the underlying cause is healed
Seventh Forty Chapter
In the management of ulcers
The ulcers often benefit from the application of a dressing which provides relief and protection, especially if they are caused by excessive mucus or bile.
If the dressing is not applied and the ulcer is in its early stages of formation and treatment as mentioned earlier, and it does not subside, and the swelling persists, it is likely that gangrene has spread over the entire area and it is necessary to amputate the affected part The first mark is in the middle of the head, known as the mastoid, and the second mark is below it towards the eyebrow at the end of the hair. Two marks are on the cheeks and one behind the ear and one at the nape of the neck. The thumb and little finger are used to indicate these marks, and their effect extends to the bone
The discharge from the ulcer facilitates the escape of thick fumes and causes the formation of a cavity also on the surrounding area, and if the ulcer persists for a long time and pus appears, it is necessary to form these cavities in the head as well The thumb rests on the nasal bone, and two fingers rest on the jaws, two fingers rest on the cervical vertebrae, and one large finger rests on the transverse process of the scapula when the shoulder is dislocated, and another above it in the same place, and two on the forearm on each side, and one on the wrist. Two on the ankles, one on each ankle, two on the knees, two on the thighs, two on the chest and two on the collarbones, two on the elbows and two on the wrists and on every finger and toe joint, and two on the heel of each foot.
The ulnar nerve is preserved from the back of the heels lest it be injured, and it may be supported on the rib cage or the stomach or the liver. Know that the more you support, the better and the more effective it will be.
And know that excessive support does not benefit the limb and may cause it to become limp because of the stiffness of its parts. The support should be moderate in size according to the organs and joints as they progress in their characteristics
Then treat the limb with meticulous traction with herbs and other treatment until it heals, God willing.
The eighth and fourtieth chapters.
In the case of limb fracture, when a limb is fractured, treat the limb with medication and plaster casts until it heals. Do not remove the cast because of fear of stiffness of the limb according to the size of the bone or limb, but keep the cast clean and slightly tight.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals. Some numbness may remain in the back of the limb at the exit of the nerve which moves that limb due to the fracture.
No one should perform surgery except one who is visually adept and has dissected organs and nerves that move freely throughout the body.
Chapter XLI.
The tenth chapter deals with the eye
If the pupil does not respond, and there is no remedy for its condition, make a small incision in the cornea until the white of the eye changes color.
Then treat it with precision using a lens with unguentum of beeswax or the fat of lamb or chick or any other material that can be used, mix them all together and apply them to the wound and keep the place firm until it heals
Chapter L.
The Fiftieth Chapter: Treatment of Cancer
If the cancer is new and you wish to stop it, apply mustard plaster around the circumference as it rotates. Some scholars have mentioned that one should apply burnt alum to the middle of the wound, but I have not seen this and do not believe it to be effective.
It is better to apply it around the circumference as we have mentioned or with many patches.
Chapters L and LI
The Eleventh and Twelfth Chapters: Treatment of Fever
If there is a swelling in any part of the body and it has become painful either from the bite of an animal or from old age if the person is weak in blood or from prolonged illness and you wish to expedite the healing of the swelling, apply around it many small patches that will absorb the swelling
Then leave it alone, for it will expedite the healing process. If you wish to strengthen it, apply a warm compress to the area
And bring it down to the middle of the wound until it passes through the skin, and let the cavity be empty of anything below that which facilitates the flow of pus, and then treat it with what is appropriate until it heals.
The Second Fifth.
In the cavity of the abdomen
The abscess is like fat that is in the organ and surrounds it like fire, and if you see an abscess in a place where there is a cavity containing both fat and fire, then know that there is much harm and swelling there, small and large, according to what suits that place.
Then drain it from all sides until the abscess is completely evacuated, and leave it for three days, and apply a plaster of powdered potassium permanganate with oil until the swelling subsides.
Then treat it with nourishing drugs, and if after three days you see that the flesh is healing properly without abscess, remove the cavity from the remaining infected area, and the abscess can be treated with strong medicine
For indeed, it is like fire in its action and its benefit is rapid, and as for its treatment, I have mentioned it above. Take it from there when you need it.
The Third Fifth
In the cavity of the viscera, both inverted and non-inverted
There is much of this matter in the feet, and it is a harsh and painful thing for a man. The cavity contains either fat or fire, or both fire and water with great harm
For indeed, the abscess is like the fat of the liver and the like of it, which surrounds the nerves like a bundle of iron. It is made from charcoal on the surface of the wound, and is strong poison that surrounds the wound from all sides. Then it is grasped and brought towards the wound, and the thumb is wrapped around the wound until the cavity reaches the depth of the wound.
Leave the wound open for three days, then cover it with pure butter softened with salt. Leave the dressing on overnight. When it is removed, it will draw out the pus from its source. Then apply a healing ointment to the wound until it is healed, if the surrounding tissue is not affected.
There is often much that happens on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet. In such cases, take a tube of lead or iron or pieces of quill from a rooster and pass it through the wound and into a container of strong water.
Grasp your hand and turn it slightly so that the tube passes close to the root of the nail. Strong water will then reach the root of the nail and remain there for a while.
Leave it as it is until the nail comes out from its source. In this way you will do it to all of them until you reach the whole of the body, then treat the remaining parts after the pus has drained from the wound.
Part four and five.
In this manner.
If any of the nails of the foot becomes loose from the bone in the heel or from the marrow cavity or from something else, then it is necessary to form four or five stitches between each two stitches and over the bone. And on its margin is the mustard plaster which, when the nail is painful and relaxed, speeds up the healing of the cold ulcer.
Part five and five
In the case of a burn on the body.
Foreign bodies in the body may cause swelling due to cold, greasy and viscous materials. The initial sign is that they cover the head of each swelling like a thin veil.
Foreign bodies in the body may cause swelling initially due to their cold, greasy and viscous nature. The initial sign is that they cover the head of each swelling like a thin veil. Subsequent swelling should not be excessive and should subside with vomiting.
Chapter VI. Fifty.
In the case of bleeding from a severed artery.
Bleeding often occurs from an artery that has been severed at the site of injury, or from a wound or swelling in the vicinity.
If any of the above occurs, grasp the bleeding vessel with your hand and place your thumb over the bleeding point and tighten it firmly until bleeding stops. Then place on it a few small and large cotton pads soaked in oil and cover with them until the bleeding stops completely
Then take out one, or two, according to the wound and the location of the bleeding vessel, and cover the area with a pad after removing your thumb and holding the pad firmly until bleeding stops
If, when you lift your thumb from the bleeding vessel, the bleeding does not stop, put on another pad immediately and hold it firmly until bleeding stops. Repeat this process one pad at a time until bleeding stops
And keep your hand still so that no further bleeding occurs. If the artery continues to bleed, it is unable to be ligated and especially if it is large. In such a case, only four methods remain: ligate with a clamp as mentioned previously, or by cautery, or by ligation at the root, or by excision of the artery if possible If the vein should become taut and constricted at its two extremities, and bleeding results, it may be tied off with sutures and strengthened, or medicinal substances may be applied that will cut off the blood supply and tighten the surrounding tissues.
Or, if one attempts to cut it off by ligation or constriction or by inserting burning substances - and the like - it will not suffice to arrest the bleeding except at the site of the wound, if a physician or drug has not been applied previously. In such a case, it is necessary to place the thumb over the opening of the wound itself, as we have described.</start_of_turn>
And it must be tightly bound until the blood ceases to flow from above the wound over the vessels and the fingers; for it does not cease from the wound except by severe cold, which will freeze the blood and thicken and stop it.</start_of_turn>
Chapter Two.</start_of_turn>
Regarding wounds, fractures, and surgeries and the like.</start_of_turn>
As we mentioned in the previous chapter, various diseases and injuries involve the application of drugs, fire, and caustic substances. It has become customary to address these matters in separate chapters of this century-old text.</start_of_turn
And I shall elaborate on this subject in greater detail so that the seeker of knowledge may find it easier.</start_of_turn
Before I proceed, let me remind you that this chapter contains abundant knowledge that surpasses what has been mentioned in the previous chapters concerning the various matters.</start_of_turn
Therefore, utmost caution must be exercised, for the work in this chapter often involves the risk of excessive bleeding, which is a vital process when opening a vein or performing surgery on a tumor, abscess, or fracture, or when removing an arrow or performing surgery on an organ or limb. Such risks are associated with great danger and can lead to death in many cases.</start_of_turn
I warn you concerning the occurrence of matters that seem suspicious to you. Indeed, such matters have befallen many people in this industry due to various ailments, some of whom have succumbed to their illness.
Beware of matters that arouse suspicion. Many people in this industry have fallen victim to various ailments, some of whom have died from their illnesses. Some have spent their wealth in an attempt to regain their health, while others have offered their services with the hope of recovery, yet all these efforts have been in vain.
Beware of matters that inspire suspicion. Many have perished in this industry due to various ailments, some even after spending wealth in pursuit of recovery. Others have offered their services in the hope of healing, yet all their efforts proved futile. Do not be deceived by superficial appearances or promises that lack substance. Trust only proven knowledge and reliable information to ensure your safety and well-being.
May God bestow upon you wisdom, praise, and glory, and inspire you with truth and guidance. For it is He who gives life and death, and He is the most worthy of praise and trust

The First Chapter.
On the treatment of water that collects in the heads of young children.
This ailment is frequently observed among newborns when the fontanelle of the head is compressed without care, and it can also be caused by an underlying condition that is not known
I have not encountered this condition among adults. However, among the children I have seen, some have died shortly after exhibiting similar symptoms. Others have continued to work despite their condition, and I have also seen cases where the condition has progressed to the point where the head has swelled daily Until the patient remains seated and his head and limbs are relaxed, the swelling will increase until his death.
The swelling may either accumulate between the skin and bone or under the bone on the abdomen. The surgeon must perform an incision in the middle of the head, one inch in length, until the fluid is expelled.
If the swelling is great and the abscess is large, make two intersecting incisions on this image:.</start_of_turn>
If the swelling is under the bone and the sutures of the head are open from all sides, and the fluid decreases when you press it with your hand inwards rather than outwards, then you must make three incisions on this image.</start_of_turn>
Once the fluid has drained, suture the incisions with silk and bandage them with cotton wool. Leave the dressing in place for five days. Then remove the dressing and apply ointment and medicine. Do not tighten the dressing excessively and feed the patient nourishing food with little fluid.
Until the limb recovers and heals, another incision is required to observe the position of the abscess and to see where the fluid is accumulating, as it may be at the back or front or on the right or left side of the head
The incision is made at the site of the abscess and the fluid is drained. Cut through any nerves without causing excessive bleeding, which may result in the patient’s death due to the bleeding associated with the draining of the fluid
Chapter 2.
Section 2.
When a severe swelling appears in the eye or the chest and treatment with drugs has failed, cutting off these two arteries is recommended.
When it is necessary to amputate these two arteries, the head of the scalpel should be grasped with the thumb and index finger, and the tissue should be held with forceps. The artery should then be exposed by stripping the surrounding tissue with the hook of the scissors. The neck of the artery should then be ligated with a tie and the pulse and surrounding tissue should be inspected to ensure that no branches have been missed.
Then the ligature is made with the needle and the arteries are cut off at the bone. This is done by placing the needle under the artery and bringing it out above the bone, with the length of the cut being about the width of two fingers together
If the blood spurts out after the artery is cut, pressure should be applied to the front and back of the wound, and the area should be inspected regularly. If the artery is not found after three fingers have passed, the ear should be palpated again and the dissection should be continued, using the needle and forceps as before
The blood will spurt out from the wound on the middle and lower parts of the body. It is possible that more or less will be sent out, depending on the force of the pulse and the size of the arteries in that area. Then the surgeon should look at the wound again and if there is anything left on the bone, it should be cut off.
So that there is no recurrence of the swelling and the wound is closed with silk suture and the patient is treated until the swelling subsides
Third Chapter.
On the arteries in the armpits
If a person experiences persistent pain in the limbs due to swelling caused by humi (wetness) and heat in the muscles of the limbs or severe headache and similar ailments, and treatment with medical remedies has not been effective, we have observed in these diseases the constriction of the arteries of the limbs or the like, as described previously.
The treatment for these conditions is to shave the hair in the limbs and to ligature the visible arteries in the groin if it is evident from their pulse and the condition of the person.
Or when the cold is severe, if you see that the hair of the limb is pale, tighten the bundle firmly with a bandage, then uncover the place with a cloth or immerse the place in hot water until the artery becomes visible to the eye clearly Then take the antidote which is indicated by this image. Then he will peel it from the skin and protect it until he reaches the artery, then he will clamp it with a clamp and pull it out from under the fat surrounding it from all sides. If the artery is tense, he will clamp it with the tip of the clamp Then cut off a piece of it as much as the distance between its two ends. It will constrict without bleeding. If it does not constrict, do not cut, for it does not bleed. Then vomit blood from the four veins to the three.
If the artery is large, tie it in two places with strong silk thread. But the thread must be either of silk or gut, for if it is not, the fat will advance rapidly towards it before the wound has healed, causing bleeding.
Then cut off the remaining part between the two knots. This is done at that moment or after some time. If you wish, you can ligate it with bone nails until it becomes necrotic in its parts. This work is done by itself or as we have said previously.
If the cause is excessive humidity or alteration of temperament, the uterus will not expel humors. It is therefore recommended that after ligating the arteries, the cavity be filled with wool and covered with cotton wool. After this, medicinal herbs should be administered, such as those that promote fat digestion and cause vomiting until the pain subsides, God willing.
If during your work there is bleeding from an artery, do not hesitate to cauterize it either with the ligature or by packing the cavity with clots. Keep your hand firmly in place until the bleeding stops. If this does not suffice, insert your finger until the bleeding is arrested.
Fill the cavity with cold water until the pain subsides and then apply pressure with your thumb and index finger, for it is easier and safer to ligate the veins than to ligate the arteries after they have been bled dry by the cautery
The pulse will descend lower until it reaches the bone and the bleeding from the two ends will cease, so that the moisture does not adhere to this part of the body. This is a useful measure.
The sensation of the two small incisions is like that of two small sacred objects, except that it is less intense than that of large incisions because if the incisions are large the fat is not digested quickly and the fire is not extinguished.
The fat is digested quickly, and this is better than any other work, easier and less painful. But after the incisions have been made, leave your fingers in place for a while.
Chapter four.
In the treatment of persistent bleeding from the veins of the eye.
If the tears are permanent, their flow is from the arteries above the root of the head outside the skull, and nothing of medical treatment or medicine helps them. I have seen the face of the patient become pale. Their flow is like the bites of ants on the chin and the eyes are hazy, wet, and swollen, their lashes have become white and their hair has fallen out. The initial treatment for this is this method, which is called the surgical treatment, that is to order the patient to pluck the hair from his chin.</start_of_turn>
Then three parallel incisions are made on the chin, each of which is as long as two fingers. The incision closest to the nose is made in the middle of the chin, while the other two are made slightly below the angle of the jaw on each side.</start_of_turn>
The blood vessels which are located on either side are preserved and those which are located beneath the jaw are clipped. Three fingers of padding are placed under each incision to protect them from injury, and there is a significant amount of bleeding associated with the procedure.</start_of_turn>
Then the sharp instrument is introduced into the tip of the incision.</start_of_turn> From the incision towards the jaw to the middle incision and all the skin between the incisions is stripped off with the periosteum covering the bone, and the same is done from the middle incision to the third incision. Then the instrument is withdrawn.</start_of_turn And another instrument called a curved needle is introduced from one side and a blunt needle from the other side, as shown in the image.</start_of_turn>
The sharp needle is directed upwards towards the fatty tissue covered with skin, and the blunt needle is directed towards the bone. They are pushed until they reach the middle incision and cut through all the blood vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without reaching the surface of the skin.</start_of_turn
If blood flow has become restricted to a section of an artery, you should perform the procedure in the middle of the section to the other end. Once the blood has drained out to an extent that will not endanger the surrounding areas, constrict the blood vessels in the area concerned and then open them up again, allowing the blood to flow freely.
If no swelling or heat exists in the area today, the doctor will apply a cold compress and use abundant water irrigation. Then he will treat it with balsam and oil or ointment as the surgeon deems necessary until it heals, God willing

Sixth Chapter.
Regarding treatment of what has fallen into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is of four kinds: either a metallic or stony substance like iron or glass, or a plant fiber such as hemp or barley, or something liquid like water or oil and the like.
Or an animal, for when it falls into the ear, parts of the stone that do not rise in the ear, grasp with something soft like butter or wax and try to remove it by moving the head or pressing on the earlobe Close the openings when the dirt has gone after you have placed around the ear a bandage of silk or wool and stretch the ear outwards so that what comes out will be like this treatment. If it does not come out, try to remove it with tweezers that are like this picture.</start_of_turn>
If it comes out with the tweezers, and not, try to remove it with a blunt needle of little curvature if it does not come out. Otherwise, make a tube of lead and insert one end of the tube into the ear hole yes or no.</start_of_turn>
Close around the tube the ointment that is filled with butter so that there is no other way out except the tube, and then pull it with force and frequently what comes out will not come out. If it does not come out with what we have described, take from the wick of the candle or from the wick of the taper that is taken from the birds something that will go into the tip of the tube.</start_of_turn>
After tying the stitches and inserting the instrument into the ear canal, remove the moisture from the ear before attempting to open the eardrum. If the eardrum does not perforate despite these measures, proceed to drilling before an abscess or perforation occurs.
The drilling technique is as follows: make a small incision at the base of the ear and remove the blood clot with forceps. Then, hold the ear cartilage between the thumb and index finger and rotate the ear downwards. Make a small perforation in the middle of the eardrum, at the lowest point of the cartilage.</start_of_turn>
The incision is semicircular in shape until it reaches the stapes. Remove the stapes with the available instruments. Then, tightly suture the incision and apply pressure until the bleeding stops.</start_of_turn>
If any foreign body remains in the ear from one of the previous drops and is not expelled, attempt to remove it as described previously. If this is unsuccessful, do not force the removal and apply a warm compress to this area.</start_of_turn>
Attempt to remove that type of foreign body from the ear only if you are confident that it has solidified due to moisture in the ear, thereby forming many small pieces. Expel it with the eardrum discharge or gently with a swab or by packing.</start_of_turn>
As previously mentioned, it is easier to remove them. As for the moisture inside the ear, use a wet swab initially or fill the ear with cotton wool, which is effective for that ear containing moisture.
Do not grasp the large pieces with your fingers and irritate them. Place a little cotton wool on the tip of your finger and insert it into the ear. Hold the ear firmly with one hand and strike the other hand against the ear bone.</start_of_turn
Once the water has drained out, and some ice or wind remains, take one hand and insert its thumb into the ear, while the other hand grasps the other side of the ear and burn until most of it is scorched. Then withdraw the hand with the thumb and insert another.
Repeat this process until all the water is expelled or until it is drained through a tube from what advances in the bladder. As for the living creatures that are inside, if they are small like lice, their bodies will be affected by the incision, but if they are large like a barleycorn, it is sufficient to burn them off as described previously.</start_of_turn>
If the creature inside is large, its presence will be evident. In this case, try to expel it through the opening and the needle. This is easier than to attempt anything inside the ear. As for the worms that may be present in the ear, if they have been treated as mentioned in the section on incisions, they will not be a problem for your treatment.</start_of_turn>
Look at the ear in the sunlight. If you see any worms, expel them through the opening or with fine tweezers. If you do not see any worms, insert a tube into the ear.</start_of_turn>
The lower part is wide and the upper part is narrow. Insert the narrow end of the tube into the ear as much as it can hold, then grasp with forceps. Repeat this process until all the worms are expelled. If they do not all come out, seal around the tube with wax as described previously.</start_of_turn
If these measures do not expel the worms, use the instruments mentioned earlier and as described previously for killing worms. This is mentioned in the section on incisions. The ointment and medicine will be applied to the ear with this instrument. This is the method.</start_of_turn
You also make it from silver or narrow brass. There is a small hole at the bottom and a wide hole at the top. If you like, make the tube from brass with a tight seam. If you like, take a thread and wrap it around the end of the tube and secure it firmly.</start_of_turn
Then you receive the fat or the salve or whatever of these remedies you wish in a tube and put it in the ear, and introduce the rod with the cutting edge from above and grasp it with your hand firmly until the fat has gone into the cavity of the ear and has softened.
Thus it is inside, but what is poured into the ear may be expelled by fire a little or be cautious lest it be too cold or too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate either

Some children may emerge from their mothers' wombs and their ears will be unblocked.</start_of_turn>
It may also happen with some people that there is a plug in the auditory canal due to a wound or a tumor in it, and this plug may be deep in the ear and not seen by the eye.</start_of_turn
It may appear outside the hole occasionally and be seen by the eye, but that which is deep in the ear and not seen by the eye is in most cases of heat of the sun. And if you see the plug there, open it with a soft touch that is like this picture.</start_of_turn>
There will be some slight swelling on one side or the other. Keep a little distance between your hand and the ear lest it should cause damage to the ear, for if the plug is from the cartilage of the ear canal that has become loose it must be grasped firmly with strong forceps until it is completely removed.</start_of_turn>
If it is deep in the ear take a little soft sponge and burn it slightly and then put it in the auditory canal, and if you feel the plug with what the ear feels of its weight and its fullness remove it with the sponge.</start_of_turn>
Keep the eardrum intact, then pierce the ear and measure the capacity of the wound. This is done in the Egyptian salve for ear ailments until the wound has healed or an opening is made and closed in water and sprinkled with powdered gypsum.
If you see that the ear has swollen and is painful, make an opening and change the opening with another one that has been made in the cartilage. This will relieve the pain and then treat the swelling until it subsides
If blood is dripping, soak a sponge or extract in cold water and put it on the ear and use the other treatments mentioned in the sections on surgical instruments.
The Eighth Section.
In the treatment of the ailments that are exposed in the cavities.
These ailments that are exposed in the cavities of the eye may be wet or dry, so it is necessary to hold them with gauze or an ointment and cut them from their roots then bear on the place powdered gypsum
If blood comes out from them, grasp it with a soft cushion and it is better after cutting and much of the time does not return if the root is cut off and the fire is not strong enough to burn that root.
The Ninth Section
In the treatment of cold sores in the cavities of the eye.
There are many things that appear in the cavities that resemble cold in their degree and their moisture.
And for that it is called cold because it is a mixture of moisture and fat in the upper and lower eyelids, and when it appears on the surface of the eye, it is easy for it to move to all parts, so it is called cold
If the edges are loosened from all sides, remove them until the flesh is free. Then, suture the edges with silk thread and clip them. If the incision has not healed sufficiently to allow the edges to be separated, this will not harm anything. However, if the incision is large, gather the edges with sutures and treat until healed.
If the incision is small, it is not necessary to close it. If there is bleeding, apply pressure and pack the wound. If the bleeding is toward the inside of the cavity, invert the cavity and suture the bleeding vessel without making further incisions
The incision did not cause any harm. Then, rinse the eye after cutting off the bleeding vessel with saline solution and treat the underlying condition until healed.
Chapter 10.
On the treatment of eye conditions involving the conjunctiva.
Conjunctivitis is a swelling that occurs in the upper layers of the eye and is more common in children. It causes their eyes to become heavy and makes it difficult for them to see in the sunlight In order for tears to flow more quickly.
And their faces are always swollen and their eyes are moist. When you put your fingers on them, you feel the conjunctiva between them. The procedure is to put the head of the patient towards your chest
Then take a piece of silk and make a loop from it. Make a circle around what is holding the conjunctiva from all sides and then put it on and clip it with your fingers from all sides to gather the conjunctiva in the middle
If there is swelling in the middle of the cavity, make an incision along the width of the swelling without making the incision larger than the incision in the abdomen. As for the depth, cut through the skin until you reach the bone.
In many cases, the bone protrudes from the incision like a white fatty piece and is grasped with a forceps which has been passed between your fingers. You rotate your hand inward and outward until it becomes loose and you withdraw the forceps gradually increasing the size of the incision until the swelling is released without injuring the surrounding area
If the bone does not protrude from the initial incision, it is necessary to gradually increase the size of the incision until the bone finally protrudes. Then grasp it as described above and cover the wound with a dressing and waterpack.
Place it in the cavity of the incision to absorb the remaining swelling, then treat it until it heals. If any inflammation occurs in the area, apply cold packs and painkillers until it subsides.
Chapter Ten.
The Tenth Chapter. On Treatment of Eye Injuries.
If there is swelling in the eye, the abnormal methods of treatment under normal medical procedures are harmful. This causes damage to the eye, leading to ailments such as permanent damage, relaxation of the eyelids, and discoloration, until it becomes the cause of blindness.
The eye is treated from four aspects: with a wet compress or cold application, with strong medication, or by cutting and stitching, or by cautery on what is appropriate.
The head of the eyebrow should be placed on your palm. Then grasp the eyelid with your left hand and if it does not invert, insert a needle under the hair and pass the needle from below and bring it out from above, which is close to the hair itself and grasp the thread from above the eyelid
The flap is elevated and the incision is made inside the eye without any excessive hair. The needle is then passed from the larger aperture to the smaller one and the thread is tied off below the eye with a small knot or protrusion.
Like the form of a thin paper clip, it is important to note that the form should be as much as needed to raise the eyelid as people differ in this respect, and some may need to cut more of the eyelid than others depending on how much the eyelid is lax
Some people may need to cut less of the eyelid, depending on how much the eyelid is lax. The incision is then made along two lines that have been learned and begins from the larger aperture to the smaller one, and the incision is close to the natural hair line like the thickness of a thread
The needle then enters through one of the skin's angles and is sutured all the way through. The stitches are then secured by tying off the thread with a soft knot and are fixed to the brow with some absorbable substances.
Do not do this, otherwise nothing will be achieved. Leave the stitches and thread in for approximately three or four days and then treat it. If you wish, you can leave the wound un-stitched and treat it with something that absorbs moisture and helps to contract the tissue. The eyelid will then naturally rise when the wound is closed and the stitches are removed.
In this case, the patient has already been mentioned in the initial instructions, and there is some skill required for the work without any danger. As for the other face, the instructions are similar to the form of a thin paper clip as we have already described Then the eyelid is raised with three tweezers, which are separated or arranged in this manner:
Then cut away any remaining bone fragments with a small saw according to the pattern of the fracture.
If you are unable to stabilize the fragments and the fracture is large, take an awl and pass a silk thread through the center of the fracture and pass another thread close to the larger fragment and a third thread close to the smaller fragment. Gather the threads together with care and elevate your hand steadily and cautiously.</start_of_turn>
Elevate the limb above your heart as described above, and then close the wound with sutures and treat until the swelling subsides. If there is any swelling or bruising around the area you have cut or fractured, drain the swelling with a bandage and support it with soothing ointments.</start_of_turn>
The lower limb may also swell excessively, so use what has been mentioned regarding cutting, stitching, cauterization, ointment, strong dressing, and elevation of the limb.</start_of_turn>
The cauterization should be performed in this manner: after bending the limb and exposing the fracture, make a small incision from inside outwards, and then make two or three small cuts of equal length along the fracture line, the width of which is less than the width of the callous.</start_of_turn
There may be a fracture in both extremities of both sides where the threads are held. Then gather the remaining limb and tighten the two incisions from both sides and leave it for a while. If the soft tissue is tense and the bone is dead and blackened, it will die and decompose naturally.</start_of_turn>
Until it is loosened from its place, if you delay treatment, the limb will decay and must be excised. Treat until healed. If the limb swells and the edges of the wound are not closed, this is known as making two incisions of this size and length.</start_of_turn
Chapter Twenty-Sixth.
In the elevation of the shaggy hair from the eye of the needle.
If there is hair or hairs which are causing difficulty in that, take a fine needle and pass a thread of fine silk through it and tie a knot at the end of the thread which is about the length of a hair.
Then pass the thread through the eye of the needle again and tie a knot at the end of the thread which is about the length of a hair. Then pass the thread through the knot which you made and tie a knot at the end of the thread which is about the length of two hairs. Then put the tip of the needle into the hair root and take it out from below the skin.
And pass it through the eyelid quickly until you take it out from above the natural hair. Then draw the thread up over the wound and pass it through the wound again. The hair will be caught if there is one or two or three at most
Then draw your hand over it until the hair comes out with the wound in the eyelid with the natural hair. If you grasped the wound and the hair did not come out with it, grasp the wound downwards by the thread which you had tied until the wound comes out from the highest point
Then bring the hair out again and grasp it. Do this until the hair stands up in the wound and you see it. Then remove the wound and the thread and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days until the hair has healed in its place and the surrounding tissue has regenerated
If the hair is short, either add to it a long hair of natural hair and let it grow with it, or leave it until it grows by itself. When it has grown, pull it up.</start_of_turn>
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of the ailment that occurs in the upper part of the eye.
That which causes this ailment is called "Arnbiyah". It is either natural or acquired. The acquired form is due to injury from a wound or other foreign substance, such as dust or hair, or the like.
The work in this case is to dissect that membrane and separate its layers. Between them should be made a passage of silk and tie it until it heals. It is not permissible to use anything that will dry or tighten
If you do that, the ailment will become worse than before. Use only soft materials like silk and cotton, boiled in hot water with camphor and vinegar, and apply some ointment to it and cover the wound with a bandage.
And do not neglect any means that will not cause harm to the body that was previously upon it. This work which we have mentioned is some improvement of the ailment, not that it will restore the body to its original state as before
Chapter Fourteen.
In the treatment of the ailment that is in the lower part of the eye
This ailment is known as "Haqqa Shitra". It is natural and the acquired form is due to injury from a wound or other foreign substance such as dust or hair, or the like
The method is to take a needle and pass a thread through it and sew it from the inner angle to the outer angle until the thread is between two ends of the tissue. Then pull the tissue over the needle and cut it off with a wide needle
If the jaw is returned to its proper position and the pulp is not taken out, place a pledget on the fissure and rotate the jaw so that a split is made on the inner side of the jaw, and the ends of the split are from the points where the fracture originally occurred until they meet, forming a triangle. Until such time as the jaw has regained its normal shape, resembling the original form
Then that fatty tissue is removed from the area as far down as possible, without damaging the jaw. The fractured fragments are then reunited with sutures of silk thread, and the wound is dressed with the unguents mentioned previously until it is healed
If the suture has passed through a perforation, or if there is a knot or tear, make a small incision without disturbing the edges. Then separate the layers carefully with a needle on what has been mentioned previously
And as for the treatment of the fracture of the jaw, if it is from above or from below, work on it according to the condition of the fracture, for there are many variations in the case, and the surgeon must be skilled in any way he can be
Until the jaw is returned to its normal shape or something very close to it, and the disease indicates what is appropriate for him to do and the instrument which is most suitable in most cases
Chapter Fifteen.
On the juncture of the jaw and the eye socket, with the dura or periosteum.
This condition often occurs in many people that the jawbone is higher than the eyeball, preventing the normal movements of the eye, so it is necessary to bring down the jaw fragment
If the adhesion is above or around the organ, grasp it with fine forceps without causing damage to the organ itself. The grasp should not be too tight, as this may cause discomfort during the operation and the forceps may slip and damage the eye.
Wait until the eyelid returns to its normal position and the adhesion has vanished. Then, instill into the eye a saline solution or wash it out with water. Finally, separate the eyelid from the eye with silk thread.</start_of_turn>
After that, place from above the eye a wet swab and a white pad. On the third day, use the sutures that were previously placed until the swelling subsides.</start_of_turn>
Sixth Chapter.</start_of_turn>
In the excision of tumors and the repair of wounds.</start_of_turn>
The wound may be on two surfaces or on a nerve. It is like a solid membrane of fat or like soft dough if it is fatty or if iron or lead has been embedded in it or if it has been burnt.</start_of_turn
It has not been sutured. The two varieties both begin from the larger opening and become less and less until they cover the pupil and prevent the light and movement of the eye. The work in their excision is to put the lower eyelid over the eyeball.</start_of_turn
Then open the eye and raise the eyelid with your hand. Grasp the tumor with fine forceps and pull it out slightly upwards. Then take a needle and pass a hair of hair or a piece of hair from a cow or a strong thread and pierce the center of the tumor.
The needle pierces the tissue and is secured with a thick thread, which is then drawn up above and tied alongside the bundle of hair that lies at the root as if it were spreading it out to the end. Then the remainder is cut off at the base of the follicle with a fine needle or a small scissors, leaving the hair naturally attached to the root.
To prevent the discharge of permanent tears, the hair should be removed with the root either with the needle alone or with a thread as we have mentioned, and then the follicle should be clipped at the apex where these images appear.</start_of_turn>
And care must be taken that the needle does not damage the mucous membrane in making the incision, for there will be resistance there and the follicle will be torn, then after cutting, something of powdered salt or aromatic herbs should be placed into the eye and left for another day before treating it as usual to cause it to heal properly.</start_of_turn>
If the hair is not stiff and a needle cannot be inserted or secured within it, then in this case there is no need for surgery or medication, for it will heal naturally as described previously. If you still wish to remove it, open the eye cautiously.</start_of_turn>
Take a fine needle with a slight curve and grasp the hair at its root as shown in this image.</start_of_turn Be careful not to pull the hair from above the root but rather from below the root. If you see that it is splitting or tearing, only grasp the root and leave the hair outside the eye from the surrounding hairs or salt and leave the eye closed for a day.</start_of_turn
Then do the work again until they are all gone, except for the blackhead. Leave the blackhead and treat the inflammation until it heals, then do the work again with the needle until it heals, and leave the hair natural.</start_of_turn>
If the pupil is swollen due to inflammation, do not remove the pupil entirely. Cauterize it with a sponge and cut away some of it without causing leakage. Do not sever the pupil completely lest blood vessel leakage ensue.
Seventh Chapter.
On the excision of tumors and fatty protrusions from the eye
There may be in the eyes of some people a reddish tumor that is firm and extends until it covers the pupil or approaches it or covers the eyelashes.
The method is to place a little lead weight on the palm of the hand and open the eye cautiously and remove the tumor entirely with the forceps.
Or grasp it with forceps or tweezers and cut the tumor little by little until it is all gone without causing damage to the eye. The cutting should be either as we have described in the section on cautery or by a small incision Like that in which the veins are ligated as described in the preceding chapter.
If you cut it out and all the blood vessels are gone, put a little salt in the eye or instill in it a little scarlet powder and bandage the eye from outside with a white bandage to prevent bleeding
If there is still something of the blood vessels remaining and there is bleeding, moisten the inflammation and leave the eye for a while and treat the cause of the inflammation. Then do the work again until the swelling subsides completely and the tumor is completely removed.
Do not attempt to treat a weak eye by cautery or surgery. Do not put your hand into anything of these procedures until you are confident that you can perform them correctly.
Eighth Chapter.
On the Incision of the Sclera of the Eye.
The vessels that are [usually] red in colour run over the eye in the region of vision and cause it to become weak with the passage of time. Therefore, if you see a person who has strong eyes and no other disease except for the vessels, then it is necessary for you to investigate the condition of the vessels of the eye before you can say that there is any other disease.
The incision is that you order the assistant to place his head in your lap and then you hook those vessels either singly or in pairs according to your expertise, and the hooks should be fine and flexible in this manner:
or two hooks may be placed together in one body in this manner
Then you will cut through those vessels with a fine scissors and bleed them out little by little until you see the eye free from them and the blood stops flowing. This operation should be performed in the shade, for the sun will impede the healing process
and remain steadfast in your work, for if you cut anything other than those vessels, when you have finished only the green or red veins will remain, and they will eat away at the rest of the vessels. If you are unable to remove them all at that time, leave what is painless in the eye, even if some of the vessels remain
and leave it for some days until the pain subsides and the swelling goes down. Then repeat the operation on this manner until the mark of the incision has vanished from the eye
And leave it [meaning the patient] with the head of the assistant in the lap, and the other end wiping away the mucus and achieving the reflection in the front of the eye and behind it]. The original intention is in this work that you should open the eye with precise incisions, like those of a triangle, that will not damage the eye.
If the apex of the eye is on the bony prominence, and the tear sac is released and the pupil is wide open, the first option is to begin the incision from above the eye, or from below. The first pair of incisions is made in the upper canthus, one at the end of the eyebrow and the other at the beginning.
The middle and lower eyelids are grasped between the thumb and index finger. Incisions are then made under the eyelashes from below the eyebrow to the corner of the eye. The hand is then hooked over the edge of the eye and the tendon is grasped. The tendon is cut from the lateral angle towards the medial angle, as desired.
The pupil is released and the eyelashes are grasped. The entire lash row is elevated until it rests on the edge of the bone. The tear sac is not allowed to split, and bleeding must be controlled (coagulation).
The iris is then cut from above and below the limbus until no white of the eye remains visible. It is permissible to remove the iris from the periphery of the cornea by hand for better visualization.
If the iris is completely cut, it will be loose and will cause pain. It must be sutured in place and allowed to rest. The work is then completed on it.
Chapter 19.
In response to the inquiry regarding the nose.
The physicians call a nosebleed a "nasus." If it is treated with pressure or strong medication applied to what is advanced in the description, and it does not subside, it must be incised on the bulge when it swells and all the blood clots must be evacuated from it or the pus.
Until the bone is exposed. If you see bone fragments in it or pus, remove them with this instrument.
The fragment describes a surgical instrument called the "khoshna ra's," which is made of Indian steel and has a head resembling a saw. Grooves are carved on the instrument's surface and it is placed on the site of the bone defect. The instrument is then rotated between the thumb and index finger until the defect has been corrected.
The instrument is then rotated several times, and the dry, powdered astringents are applied. If the position is corrected and fat is infiltrated, the wound is closed and the vein is ligated. The total time for the procedure is forty days, and there was neither bleeding nor infection.
It is evident that the patient has healed, for otherwise there would be no reason to re-expose the bone either with iron or with strong medication. If the bone is exposed, a dressing should be applied to this area
The limb is then supported like a tripod and is bound with silk thread. The dressing is placed on the bone itself, which is close to the thumb and index finger, and the thumb is gradually moved towards the little finger.
If air comes out, if you feel it in your nose, tighten the powder-applied astringents as I have taught you. If fat has infiltrated and the wound has closed, the foreign matter that was causing the swelling will return to the nose, which will make the wound less painful God willing.
The tenth part.
The eye socket.
If the eyeball is complete and there is no loss of vision, then it should be relieved of pain, separated from the globe, and a bandage placed over the defect without any additional support.
The surgeon places over the eye a patch made from wool, flaxseed, milk, and urine, and then sutures the eye from above over the swelling, using many stitches. The description of the swelling indicates that it should be treated with many strong incisions that break up all its discharge into four parts, from which many are made.
The surgeon places one over the other over what is necessary for the eye, and then sutures it with a strong thread, strong and firm. He repeats the packing with sponges from outside and inside, and then removes the packing and leaves the eye sutured for a day or two.
If the ligament relaxes during this time, it is necessary to tighten the eye again. The ligament is then removed after a day or two as we have mentioned. If the eye has recovered, the swelling, stitches, and packing are removed until the eye has healed
The Twenty-fourth Chapter.
On Eye Injuries.
If there is a tear in the layer of the eye, and it prolapses outwards like a piece of the eye and the man is in pain because of it, and I must cut it out. This is done as follows: ...
And I enter a needle into the base of the eye from below to above, and then I enter another needle into it with a strong thread like this, and I tighten the first needle as it is.
Then I cut the place of bending of the strong thread and connect it with some of the eyeball surrounding the needle and tighten it well. I then remove the needle and place on the eye a wet swab and white wool and leave it until the stitches are dissolved.
Until the wound heals, and the eye is sutured from all sides with silk thread of different colors until the eye becomes accustomed to the tension, and it is bound with a soft cushion that reaches the bottom of the eye, and the wound is drained of its discharge, and the eye is closed with sutures until it heals
Chapter Twenty-Third.
In the Treatment of Burns.
These are the burns which are called "burns" because their essence is that they are a collection of water which has descended without its head, and the method of treatment for it is that the physician should sit on a chair and take its head with both hands from both sides.
And he should move it until he sees the burn becoming towards the bottom of his eye, then he should fix it and it will not move, and light will be seen in it as before, and if it does not descend to the bottom we know that it is water, and if it does not descend we must know that it is something which has been mentioned before
And he should sit the patient between his hands and take a little piece of wool and put it over the membrane of the conjunctiva slightly above the meeting point of the limb with the membrane of the conjunctiva in the eyeball until the substance comes out
And if only the water comes out, it is hot water which has mixed with dust or water which has boiled with dust and there is an abscess, then it is treated with all the treatment until it is healed
Chapter Twenty-Third
We have mentioned the types of water in division and which one reaches the basin by word without explanation, so take it from there on a cushion, for when he is sitting there facing the sun, he should sit between his hands
And he should bind the healthy eye and tighten it firmly with his hand, then lift the edge of the eye with his left hand if it is the left eye or with his right hand if it is the right eye.
The sacred finger is placed upon the elbow with the palm of the hand facing inwards, then the finger is pushed forward with force and held until it pierces the eyeball and the sensation of the finger reaching the empty space is felt.
The sacred finger is placed on the elbow with the palm facing inwards, then the finger is pushed forward with force and held until it pierces the eyeball. The sensation of the finger reaching the empty space is felt
The finger is then drawn down repeatedly until the water has drained from the eye. The pupil remains open until the water has drained completely.
If it settles and does not rise again, remove the sacred finger with your hand. A little pressure should suffice. Then it melts into the water, leaving behind a little salt or mucus, which is washed out from the eye from the inside and out. Then apply some bandage or cotton wool to the eye
The eye should be washed with water and a little salt, and the bandage should be secured with white of an egg. As for us and our people, we apply a wet compress with a little moisture to the eye, for sometimes the eyeball is too hard for the sacred finger to penetrate ... and take a little coolness that is called 'abdeh'.
... and it only pierces the membrane lightly without causing pain. Indeed, when the sacred finger has reached its place, it does so gently. When your work is finished, prepare the eyeball lying face downwards in a dark room
... and forbids all movement and swallowing, and makes its food tasteless. It does not move its head excessively forward or backward. The bandage should remain in place for three days, and then it is removed in that dark room and the eye is tested
Avoid doing things and then binding them until the seventh day. Do not do this during treatment or after quitting time, but rather avoid it beforehand when the water rises quickly and the sight is intense.

Until one learns that all tissue has perished and nothing remains of it, save for remnants, one must cautiously dissect with an instrument while supporting the surrounding area until nothing remains. If blood clots or swelling and inflammation remain, the limb must be abandoned.
Until one learns that all tissue has perished and nothing remains, save for remnants, one must cautiously dissect with an instrument while supporting the surrounding area until nothing remains. If blood clots or swelling and inflammation remain, the limb must be abandoned. The surrounding tissue should be evacuated of any neoplasia, for it will cause the vessel to become obstructed and the tissue to perish. The limb should be opened from the navel and the blood vessels and nerves should be examined.
The limb must be opened from the navel and the blood vessels and nerves should be examined.
And many knots must be made, and the hand must be protected between each two knots, and the thread must be held by the little finger and the thumb must grasp the end of the thread in the nose or wherever convenient, until it reaches the chest.
And the thread comes out of the loop and is made thick many times as is often done by unskilled people in books, and this is easy for one who wishes to do so. Then the two ends of the thread are gathered together, one of which comes out of the mouth and the other which remains in the nose
Then the tissue is used to tighten the knot that is in the thread, and this is done until one learns that the tissue has been cut by the knot and the thread comes out and becomes blood-stained. This is done for three days or more.
Until all the remaining tissue has been eaten up by the infection, and only blood remains, which becomes like lead in the nose at any moment. If treatment is needed, it should be abandoned, for it has been of no avail
These are the instruments used for cutting to the bones and medicines in the nose.
He places from beeswax or hippocress a small candle wick open and greasy, and a tube also.
And if you wish to make a closed tube like a tube and greasy the instrument with a straight spatula
It has a handle at the end of it as you see, which grasps if there is fat or whatever of the juices or liquid things are in it
The fifth and twenty-ninth parts.
In the nostrils at the tip of the nose
There are many things that cause swelling at the tip of the nose that increases and becomes visible with the days until it becomes normal.
And so it must be cut in the first hour and take out all of it, and then carry on the poultice or the caustic medicine which replaces the poultice, for if it is left in, it will swell and if it is solid like black bile a little of the bile will suffice.
Do not expose it to the iron, for I have seen many instances of excision of this tumor where great bleeding followed on its account, and though the tumor is large and soft like black bile, I have seen that excision can be performed in all of these cases So drain the urine and excise it without haste or fear, and treat the place with something that dries and contracts until it heals.

In the stitching of the nose, cheek and ear If it is separated from the wound or something like that, know that it has become detached in one of these parts, so do not be surprised if work is not done in it except in some people
When a wound is large enough to show any part of its circumference, if its edges are soft and adhere to each other, suture them together and treat the wound until it heals. If its edges have separated and are widely separated, remove all sutures and leave only the surrounding skin intact until the wound has healed.
Suture the edges together and tighten them. Place sponges and lint over the wound and apply either oleaginous ointment or other absorbent dressings. Leave it covered for two or three days before removing the sutures.</start_of_turn>

On the extraction of teeth.
It is necessary to treat the tooth from every possible angle and be able to grasp it firmly so as not to leave any of it behind since it is a sacred treasure even if it is not necessary to extract it.
If you must extract the tooth, make sure that it is firmly grasped until the tooth is completely removed It is common for what appears to be inflammation in the wisdom tooth to actually be in the healthy tooth itself, and the pain persists until the wisdom tooth is extracted. We have seen this happen with many patients
If the wisdom tooth appears healthy, but there is pain in the jaw, it is necessary to bandage the area around the tooth with some force until the gum is loosened from all sides and can be easily moved by the fingers or forceps, or slightly loosened
Then you will be able to easily remove the large molars without damaging the root or tooth. If it does not come out, use these instruments to hold it firmly from every side and move it as you did before
If the tooth is perforated or fractured, it is necessary to fill the hole with paste and cover it securely with a fine brush. This will prevent the opening from widening while you are holding it with forceps
Maintain your effort so that it does not break. Some of the tooth will remain behind even after grasping it firmly, as is often the case with the work of barbers and dentists.
Whatever befalls people without great harm, will not break their teeth, and their roots will remain whole or some of them. Whatever befalls people without great harm, will not break their teeth, and their roots will remain whole or some of them.

The instrument is not capable of grasping or holding fragile objects, even if it is clasped alongside other teeth.
It resembles a small beak and is composed of hardened iron. The tip is keen and will sever teeth with ease. If it should happen to grasp non-teeth, it will slip from the grasp of the other teeth and will not damage them. If, however, it should grasp a tooth that will not readily yield, it must be held in place by means of a cold [clamp] so that this image is not lost
It is composed of iron and its impression is somewhat rough like the scraped surface of a needle. It cools the teeth slightly and in many days it will leave no trace of having grasped them.
If some of the teeth have fractured, the tongue will be affected by speech. It will be necessary to grasp them firmly until the fracture has healed and the teeth have become level, without causing damage to the tongue or impairing speech
Chapter Thirty-Three.
The ligation of mobile teeth with silver wire or gold wire.
If the teeth are decayed and loose, they will extract themselves or fall out of their sockets. It is not possible to do anything to prevent this without causing damage to the surrounding tissues. Treatment must therefore be administered that will make the teeth immobile and enable their healing without further loss of teeth or tissue damage
The solution is to suture with gold or silver wire. Gold is better because it does not discolor and remains flexible forever. The wire should be of moderate size and should fill the space between the teeth without causing excessive pressure
The image of ligation is as follows: take the wire and pass it through the gap between the healthy teeth, then pass the loop of the wire between the mobile teeth until it reaches the healthy tooth on the other side
Once the thread has been drawn out from its origin, grasp the hand firmly with wisdom until the tooth moves and the tension of the thread is at the roots of the teeth. Then cut off the excess thread at the tip and gather it together, closing the gap with the remaining thread and concealing it between the sound and the moving tooth.
To prevent the tongue from slipping, leave the thread securely as much as remains. If it breaks or becomes loose, the tension will be restored by another thread, which will provide lasting benefit in this case. This is the image of the teeth, representing the healthy and mobile teeth as seen from the front view.
One or two teeth may have fallen out of their place and become entangled as we have described. This will remain the case, even with the aid of the companion who has been mentioned, unless the bone is fractured in the process, forming a new socket for the teeth which have fallen out.</start_of_turn> As we have already mentioned, grasp firmly and remain comfortable.

This ligament which appears under the tongue may be either natural or have been caused by an injury which has healed.</start_of_turn
The procedure is as follows: open the mouth wide and raise the tongue up into your chest. Then, cut the nerve with a knife until the tongue is freed from its restraint. If there is some stiffness and adhesion, and this is due to scar tissue, make a puncture in it and cut through with a knife until the knot is released.</start_of_turn
Be cautious that the incision be deep in the flesh and that the vein be severed there in the display of bleeding. Then it is closed with the effect of the severance by means of rose-water or by gum and cold water, and it is placed under the tongue and a silk thread is passed through it that tightens it slightly every night.
If the tissue does not clot again and bleeding persists, sprinkle over it powdered alum. If the bleeding persists, apply a compress of adhesive bandage to the area. Then keep the wound still until it heals completely.

In the excision of the bladder under the tongue.
There may be under the tongue a swelling resembling a small bladder which hinders the tongue from performing its natural action and perhaps causes pain until it fills the mouth, and the work in this case is to open the mouth slightly at sunrise and look from the swelling.
If its colour is like muddy water or black and solid, it has no sensation and no pain is felt in it, but if there is pus in it with blood, there is pus and blood in it.
If bleeding occurs during the performance of the work, sprinkle over it powdered alum until the bleeding stops. Then return to the work until you complete it, and then close with gum and salt
Then keep the wound still until it heals completely

In the treatment of a swelling of the tonsils.
What does not sprout in the throat of all the other tumours may appear in the throat and be seen outside called tonsils. If it is treated as mentioned in the section on excision, it will not heal
If the swelling is firm like a piece of lead and has little sensation, do not prick it with the needle. If it is red in colour and its contents are thick, do not prick it either, for fear of bleeding. Leave it alone until it subsides naturally. Otherwise, you may cauterise it or it will rupture by itself.
If it is white in colour and soft and its contents are coarse, this is what necessitates incision. The procedure is to look at it before doing anything if it has already subsided and the swelling is completely or partially healed.</start_of_turn>

A woman came to me with a swelling that had penetrated her throat, causing pain and diminishing her sense of taste. The swelling was so large that it almost blocked her airway, and she was unable to eat or drink water.
And she would have surely died had she lingered for another day or two. The swelling had protruded from her throat and extended outwards as far as her nostrils. I immediately performed an incision on one of its branches and extracted a piece of solid matter from it.</start_of_turn>
Then I cut off the part where I had grasped from the nose, and I did the same with the other side of the nose. I opened her mouth and extracted the tongue, and I closed the incision with sutures. I also removed some of the swelling itself, but no blood was lost.</start_of_turn>

The leech should be placed on the belly, where it will bite according to its nature, having previously been instructed by the physician as to its colour and size. The leech should be fixed with a sandal and its tongue should be cauterised by the instrument described in the preceding section. Then the cauterised area should be sutured into the belly.
The leech should be drawn downwards and cut with one of the two instruments mentioned previously in the section on the cautery of the almond. It should not be cut more than is necessary, as this may cause damage to the voice and speech
Then, after the cutting, the physician should use the method described in the section on the cautery of the almond and should treat it until it is healed. If the belly of the leech has become loose from the cutting, the physician should use the technique known as "kifaya" without fear or caution, and apply the ointment mentioned previously, which is that the head of the leech should be placed in the armpit
Then the tongue should be cauterised by the instrument mentioned previously. Then take some strong water as mentioned in the preceding section and pour it over the area without making it burn, and cover it with the dressing mentioned previously.
The side which is placed in the ointment should be covered with the ointment like the ointment in the cheek and the leech is fixed on the side of the abdomen without causing the saliva to leak from it from within the ring, so that it does not fall to the ring anything that may harm it
Then hold your hand with the ointment and press it on the wound for about half an hour until you see that the bleeding has stopped and the ointment has settled. If you wish, take a swab and wrap it around the tip of the strong ointment and apply the swab to the wound.
Insert the swab into a tube from above until it sticks to the wound. Do this repeatedly until you reach the desired depth of the wound. Then leave it for three or four days, and if you need to repeat the ointment, do so
After having washed around the wound with lukewarm water and applied the unguents, it is then necessary to soak the area with cold water and treat from outside with compresses and from inside with poultices until the pain subsides. This method is safer and less painful than cutting or causing fear.
The ailment may also be treated by applying vapor to this degree, taking swelling, stiffness, pus, blood clots, hair and nails, and bringing together all or some of these substances in a container and immersing them in liquid.</start_of_turn>
The vessel and the container should be made of wax and placed in the center of the blanket. The wound should be surrounded by a sponge tipped with a perforated instrument of silver or lead.</start_of_turn>
The part which contains the wound should be inserted into the mouth until the vapor reaches the wound through the tube until the wound subsides. If this is not done, repeat the process several times until the swelling subsides.</start_of_turn>
Therefore, this should be done when the swelling has subsided and the wound has cooled, and if you have not prepared this instrument, take a splinter of bone and bind it at one end with an egg shell so that it does not burn the mouth.</start_of_turn>
For these reasons, the egg shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth, which is advantageous for the safety of the treatment.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 38.
On the removal of thorns and what protrudes from the throat besides that.</start_of_turn>
Often thorns or bones of varying thickness or other objects protrude in the throat, and it is necessary to remove them. The tongue should be clamped with an instrument at the surface of the sun when the surrounding area is exposed.</start_of_turn
If there is something in the throat which you do not see or feel, you must evacuate it before it is swallowed with the food. Otherwise, it may come up or be swallowed in a piece.
Or it may swallow a piece of bread that is tough or take a piece of sea sponge which sticks to the thread and then swallow it. If it reaches the place of the thorn, grasp the thread quickly and do this several times.</start_of_turn>
And often when the thorn or bone is in it, it comes out by itself. But if it does not come out as we have mentioned, use an instrument like a needle on this picture.</start_of_turn>
It is most common for the clot to be little and in its end it closes the opening of the wound. It raises its head upwards and rests from the tonsils so that the bone or thorn does not get caught in it, or that the wound does not become inflamed.</start_of_turn
And the insertion of the needle into it is better than pulling out the thorn or bone. It is pushed downwards or grasped by the forceps upwards. All of this is done until it comes out.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 39.
On the evacuation of foreign bodies from the throat.</start_of_turn>
If you have treated the wound as we have mentioned and it has not healed, when the patient comes to you again, look in the throat of the patient after he has swallowed, when his tongue is relaxed by the instrument that you have described to him.</start_of_turn
And if you see that the clot has adhered to the wound, grasp it with a small forceps or with a tight ligature. If you are unable to do this, take a catheter and insert it into the throat up to the vicinity of the clot, and then insert into the lumen of the catheter a pledget protected from the flame.</start_of_turn
He does it repeatedly and remains patient regarding water throughout the day, then he takes an inflated bladder filled with cold water and opens his mouth and inserts it and joins it and does not swallow anything from it. He moves the water around with his hand afterwards.
If the clot descends to the position and one feels water, but it does not come out as described previously, then he should moisten the throat with urine and with the instrument described in the preceding chapter, he should do this repeatedly until it descends.
The work in the wound should take a portion containing fat and hair and the amount covered by a covering in its middle, pierce in that middle and put the instrument in it, then draw out the wound and put a little moisture in the mouth and close the mouth until he knows that the wound has reached the ring
If the clot descends to the position and one does not feel it coming out, he should repeat the wound process and remain patient and abstain from food and drink. One must not force it out, for this will cause this remedy to fail. This is the image of the instrument which attracts the clot from the throat should it happen to reach it.
It is like a shuttlecock, except that this one has an additional appendage which enters the throat and its tip resembles the beak of a bird in which there is cold roughness if it bites on something and does not leave it
Another instrument which grasps the tongue is a broad ring of iron which can fit into the mouth alongside the tongue. It remains in the mouth without the patient being able to close their mouth and does not come out until it is removed manually
The description of the instrument which opens the mouth to this extent is as follows:
The Section on Wounds.
There is plenty to say regarding wounds and their treatment
Wounds are of various types and are differentiated according to what is mentioned later in this book. They differ in their bulk and severity from one type to another, depending on whether they are wet or dry in nature
The second type is more severe in areas where bones are located because the head wound is different from the buttock wound or the wound in the limb from the wound in the joint. Each one of them requires different management.
Some wounds do not necessitate dressing until the discharge has subsided and others must be dressed and these are those that have not matured like those which are close to the joints
Because if it happens close to a joint and prolongs its presence around it, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint. This will result in weakness or deformity of that limb or organ
If you remove the dressing until it has matured, you may damage the main organ or if it is close to the buttock, leaving it uncovered will result in exposure of the cavity and its contents, which will become infected
And it is important to learn the time when a wound has matured, which is when rest, the cessation of bleeding, reduction of swelling and redness, and the subsidence of fever.
It is better to drain the wound from a lower point if possible, or from the furthest point away from the wound and the nearest point to the wound. But do not drain towards the body as this may be more harmful
In all areas where tissues, nerves and blood vessels are not liable to displacement, remove the tumor according to the anatomical location. If the tumor is in an area where displacement is possible, leave it in place for the time being.
Until the tumor has subsided as we have mentioned previously, do not remove it before that if it is causing excessive bleeding, is large in size, or if it has penetrated the skin or surrounding structures.
Small tumors should be removed in a single piece, while large tumors should be removed in sections or fragments as necessary. Some tumors may require skin grafting or excision if they have become ulcerated
There are tumors which, as is common in many abscesses and wounds, may necessitate excision in the form of a triangle with three angles or cutting out a piece like a sheet of paper from the abscess or tumor.
These include the spiral incision, the crescent incision and those which do not have a head like squamous cell carcinomas which only require superficial excision. If the tumor is large and has been present for a long time, leave it partially in place until sufficient drainage has occurred
Gradually remove some of the tumor, then tighten the tumor again the next day and remove some discharge. Repeat this process gradually until all of the tumor has been removed
Especially if the patient is weak, a pregnant woman, a young child, or an elderly person, the vital spirit often faints with the discharge of purulent material. Be cautious in this situation and do not neglect this warning
Once the tumours have been extracted, the wound should be washed and dressed. If the wound is small or the tear is simple, use a fine gauze or cotton swab. If the tumour is large and there are many tears, use more extensive dressing.
The wound should be closed with sutures until some of them reach the surrounding tissue. If some part of the tumour has been separated from the skin or weakened, it should be padded with cotton wool or covered with gauze without tension and secured for three days.
Then remove the sutures and apply poultices until the bleeding stops. If blood continues to ooze during the process, use cold water and vinegar after having soaked the cotton wool in it and place it over the bleeding area several times
If bleeding persists, use astringents and treatments and methods described in many parts of this book and other texts. If it is winter and the site of the tumour is sensitive, apply cold compresses with wine and oil
and place them on the area. If it is summer and the area is sensitive, apply cold compresses with wine and oil until the third day as mentioned earlier.
and use various treatments until the wound heals. This is what is required of a surgeon who is well-versed in the treatment of tumours in general and specifically detailed in this book.
Chapter 40.
Regarding the incisions made for tumours on the head.
Small tumours that are of the variety that contain sacs, such as chickenpox or those containing moisture resembling blood.
Among these there are some substances which have a consistency like that of blood and pus and like that, and some of them are solid but readily fractured; all of these are safe in cutting and extracting without danger to the blood vessels.
The operative procedure in cutting is that you should first use an instrument which presents a resemblance to its shape afterwards; then comes the one which is called the needle until you have learned what it contains. If it contains blood, then cut it through and through simply on its length with a slight incision on this side
Begin by cutting from line ~b~ to line ~g~. If blood leaks out, remove the sac which contained it and remove it entirely. Do not leave anything of it remaining. Many times if anything remains, it will return again.
Then wipe with a piece of cotton in greasy ointment if it is present or in salt water and fill the wound with it and leave it open until tomorrow. If it has eaten up what remained of the sac, then repeat the procedure with a second and a third piece of cotton if necessary.
Until it is certain that nothing remains of the sac, then wait until the wound has healed in the ointments until it is cured, and if the swelling contains greasy matter, then cut it through on this side
The vein and nerves in the vicinity of the wound and extract it from all sides and exert your utmost in extracting the abdominal contents which contain it, for if a blood vessel is obstructed during the process, make an incision as I have described previously and also in the swelling if it is fractured.
Treatment in this case is as I have mentioned previously, and the incision on the swelling is easier because it contains little blood and pus and in some of these swellings in the head there is no blood or pus at all due to the fact that I have cut into the swelling on this side
A woman's head has many swellings like solid stones. Some of them are white and cannot be covered, even when thrown at them. The rest of the recent swellings in the head are not like these swellings which are common in young boys.
When dealing with ear discharge, make an incision at their base. This will facilitate the discharge of pus and make it easier for the medicine to reach the lower part. Then treat according to the nature of the discharge.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 24.</start_of_turn>
In the armpits there are many swellings that often appear in the neck. These swellings can also appear under the arms and in the groin. Sometimes they appear in other parts of the body. The swellings that appear in the neck are usually solitary, but sometimes there are many of them. Some of these swellings are caused by other swellings.</start_of_turn
Each swelling in the armpit has its own pouch or sac as is the case with the spleen and head swellings as we mentioned previously. There are many types of these swellings. Some of them contain fluids and some are solid containing no moisture and do not respond to treatment.</start_of_turn
I have not seen any swelling that looks good on palpation and whose appearance is close to the colour of the skin, which moves freely in all directions and does not adhere to the jugular vein, bone or artery, and is not deep.</start_of_turn It is necessary to make a small incision from above to below the body in this manner from line ~j~ to line ~b~.</start_of_turn
And separate them from all sides and stretch the skin with a pin or two or several pins as we mentioned previously in head swellings and remove them little by little. They are usually on the neck and do not break the vein or bone or artery. But they are soft and not hard like bone.</start_of_turn
Do not increase the number of cuts unnecessarily, as this may cause excessive bleeding. Cut only what is absolutely necessary. If you cut a vein or artery, seal the wound with powdered sponge or some small clots.
Close the wound and leave it until the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes. Pay attention to breathing if bleeding persists. Once the bleeding stops, resume your work until the wound is empty. Then, close the wound with small stitches and remove them later.</start_of_turn>
If the vein is large, do not cut it from its origin. Rather, ligate it with a strong suture and leave it until it naturally descends without causing harm. Then, pack the wound with cotton wool and apply a plaster dressing and treat it.</start_of_turn>
If you have already cut through the entire vein, gather the edges of the wound and suture them from that point onwards. Wait until you are certain that no blood remains. If you see that there is still blood, leave the wound open until the bleeding stops. Then, pack the wound with cotton wool and apply a plaster dressing.</start_of_turn>
Do not cut from the origin of the vein. Stitch the wound and use the sutures we mentioned previously. Leave the remaining clotted blood in place as it will naturally descend.
Then apply plaster dressing and ointment to the wound until the remaining blood clots have disappeared and the wound has healed effectively.</start_of_turn>
The third and forty-fourth section.
In the throat, when an abscess occurs inside the larynx.</start_of_turn>
The first part of this section deals with the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has sutured it with this technique. As for those who suffer from hiccups, they must abstain from suturing the epiglottis, as it will be of no benefit to them.
In order that all the organs and lungs may hang limply, and as for those who have a burning tumor in the mouth, throat or tonsils without any cause in the chest, it is necessary to perform an incision of the epiglottis to escape from these diseases.
It must be performed under three diameters from the margins of the chest or four small incisions in the width between two diameters as much as the incision is in the fat and not in the cartilage, and this is the correct position for the incision
Since it is devoid of fat and blood vessels, if the surgeon is cautious, he must wipe the mucous membrane of the throat with cotton wool before incising the skin until it reaches the chest cavity alongside the blood vessels if he sees anything of them
Then he incisions the pericardium which we have described, and rests the incision on the epiglottis from mucus which comes out with what is cut away and from hoarseness and leaves the wound open for a while. If the time that was reckoned to be sufficient for the cessation of the strangulation has elapsed, the edges of the wound are closed from the skin
It is one step from the cartilage and then we use the medicines which cause fat to swell until it is healed, as this writer has interpreted, this is to say that if they see little of it they consider that one of these tumors which we mentioned has closed the loop.
And he observed the little one and himself that he must cut the epiglottis so that the little one can breathe more easily on the position of the wound some air and save him from death, even though he leaves the wound open until the decree of sickness has passed and becomes three days and we lift it up
The wound was cleansed with vinegar and treated until it healed, and I myself witnessed that a servant had taken charcoal and applied it to the throat only, and it affected some of the lung lobes. It caused them to swell up like those suffering from consumption.
I found blood draining from the wound, and I ceased it, for it did not break the vein or bone, and the air escaped from the wound. I bandaged it and treated it until it healed, and the servant did not suffer anything except for a slight noise that did not increase
And after some days it returned to its best state, so that from this we can say that the tonsils are not dangerous in this case
The fourth chapter and forty.
On the surface of the swelling which appears in the throat from outside and is called tonsillitis.
This swelling is called tonsillitis and is large in size like that of a grape and is common in women. It is of two kinds
It is either natural or pathological. The natural kind has no treatment, while the pathological kind is associated with congestion of the blood vessels and is dangerous in its place It is not permissible to treat it with iron except for a small one if you cauterize it and open it with a needle, for it resembles consumption and is not related to any of the arteries. It comes out with what is in it if it is in a sac, or you cut out all of it, then treat the remaining area as is appropriate
Chapter Fifty-four.
On the Slit and Its Varieties.
The wound has various types and all of them have been mentioned in the classification. We will mention here the difference between the wound and the fistula because it is a problem. A fistula is accompanied by heat, swelling and pain that persists until the abscess softens. And the abscess thickens when the heat subsides. The wound does not have heat, swelling or pain and contains a fluid-filled sac that has a specific location and appears pale like blood and starts as a small wound that becomes bigger and smaller
It is of two types: either dry or moist. The moist type has many colors as mentioned in the classification. If the wound is suspected to be a fistula, it must be opened and drained first with the instrument called the dilator as described later in the book.
The size of the abscess can be known. Then the dilator is inserted and the contents are observed. If fluid of any color comes out, the wound is a fistula. A simple incision is made as described previously for other abscesses if the dilator does not extract the fluid
The wound is closed with sutures as described previously in this book. The skin is separated from the surrounding tissue and the abscess is removed if possible.
If the sac is ruptured during the process and the abscess cannot be safely removed, it should be gradually removed piece by piece until nothing remains. If some remains, the wound will become infected again
If the swelling persists despite simple measures, widen the opening of the wound with some larger needles and tighten the edges. Leave the wound open until the swelling subsides. If the swelling is large, ligate the surrounding vessels and treat the wound accordingly.
If there is persistent bleeding or oozing from the wound, widen the wound with powdered charcoal and leave it closed for two or three days until the bleeding stops and the swelling subsides. Then remove any remaining swelling
Sixth Forty Section.
In the images.
When the swelling is in the limb, there are three types of clamps used for it: large, medium, and small
Large clamp image
Medium clamp image
Small clamp image
Clamps are made of iron and are square-shaped at the ends to facilitate entry into the tumors. These are the images of clips and are called clips because they are of three types: large, medium, and small. Large clamp image: Medium clamp image: Small clamp image:
Medium clamp image
Small clamp image
These are sutured to open the wound and remove the tumor or other contents. A smooth needle is used with a needle holder made of tin or bone or steel or copper or silver. The best is the gut needle made of silk or steel
These can also be made of black lead and are used to ligate the vessels. There are three types as there are long, medium, and short
The extent to which the bandage should be applied should be such that it embraces all the circumference of the wound and maintains its tension without being excessively tight.
The bandage should be as wide as the wound and as long as necessary to provide adequate support
The bandage should be neither too wide nor too narrow.
There are various types of bandages depending on whether they have one, two, or three folds. Each type of bandage has its specific place and should be used accordingly for optimal support The large bandage The small bandage
The large-folded bandage The medium-folded bandage
The small-folded bandage
The bandage with three folds and multiple layers The bandage with three folds and multiple layers of reinforcement The bandage with three folds and multiple layers of reinforcement for smaller wounds
The large bandage with three folds
The medium bandage with three folds The small bandage with three folds
The aforementioned types of bandages are used to secure and support various lesions and wounds, depending on their size and location
The medium-sized bandage
Foreign bodies lodged in small parts of the body.
Foreign bodies in small parts of the body are limited in size, while those in other areas are not limited. This facilitates the removal of clots when there is fear of cutting vessels or nerves, and it alleviates the pain somewhat.
These images are deceptive as they are of three types: large, medium, and small
It is made of a substance similar to a honeycomb which fills up one limb like a wide pocket with two layers, in its head there is a small incision which is hidden and resembles the tongue of a bird which runs inside and outside as it pleases
The pockets which are placed between the fingers when tumours are present are of three types: large, medium, and small. The large pocket image is shown above
The images of bleeding vessels which are cut during surgery are of three types: large, medium, and small. The large bleeding image is shown above
It is made of soft or tough substance which is long and slightly flexible as seen, and it is used when necessary to quickly cut blood when other methods fail.
However, it is not used to cut blood in all parts of the body but is used in urgent situations such as the bones of the leg and arm, the breastbone and the abdomen, and around vital organs such as the kidneys or liver
Various smaller instruments can be fashioned from pieces resembling pistachio shells in shape.
These instruments cut blood, and if blood spurts from the wound or at the severance of an artery, they may be made into cauteries of this shape
Seventh and forty-fourth chapter.
Within the belly of the thigh
The one resembling a woman's breast may swell in some people up to the point of resembling a woman's breast, and becomes soft and slippery. Whoever dislikes this must make an incision on the breast with a sickle-shaped knife of this kind
From line ~b~ to line ~j~ Then remove all the fat and fill the wound with absorbent dressing. Then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat until it heals. If the breast did not descend and became relaxed as women, as is usual.
One must then make two incisions on the upper part of the breast resembling the shape of a sickle, each connecting to the other at its end. This makes a larger circle encompassing the smaller one of this shape From line ~b~ to line ~j~ then peel the skin between the incisions, remove the fat and use the sutures and dressing mentioned above until it heals
If it does not yield pieces after these measures have been taken for the preservation of the limb or in case of bleeding, it is necessary to pack the wound with absorbent cotton soaked in fat and leave it until the remaining fat has eaten away, then treat until it heals.
Eighth and fortieth chapter.
On wounds of the limbs exposed under the armpit.
The wounds of the limbs exposed under the armpit are of the stab variety, containing a sac and possessing moisture. That which contains moisture must be opened with a sickle incision in this manner.
From line ~b~ to line ~j~. If the moisture from the sac is evacuated through the wound, pack with cotton and leave for a day, then remove the cotton.
And treat with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the wound is of the kind of solid stab wound, make an incision as we mentioned concerning stab wounds, whether the wound progresses until the purulent discharge appears, then use the cautery as we mentioned previously.
Chapter 49.
In the incision of the wound which is revealed by the artery or vein and is called an aneurysm.
If the artery and skin above it are incised, there is much that is exposed from that and the wound also exposes the vein that there is swelling and swelling in it
The signs that indicate whether the swelling and swelling is from the artery or the vein are that the swelling is continuous and located deep in the body. If the swelling is caused by the artery, it will feel like there is a pulsating sensation
And if it is from the vein, the swelling is superficial on the surface of the body. The incision for these wounds is dangerous, especially if it is in the armpit, the groin, the neck and in many other parts of the body where it is very dangerous.
And what is not from these, in the limbs or in the head, where it is dangerous. What is from the artery must be incised in the skin with a long incision, then open the incision with forceps and ligate the artery from its fat.
Until it is exposed, insert the needle under the tissue and pass it to the opposite side, and tighten the blood vessels with a ligature in two places where you suspect there is a tear in the blood vessels. Then withdraw the needle from the place between the ligatures until blood escapes from it.
Once the swelling has subsided, use the treatment that produces pus until the ligaments are severed. Then treat them with appropriate medications until they heal
If the swelling was caused by a tear in the vein, grasp the swelling with your hand as much as possible. Then insert the needle under the tissue from below the swelling and pass it through to the opposite side. Tighten it with a ligature until it comes out from the other side. Then tighten it with another ligature as much as possible at two points on either side of the swelling, as you have described concerning the ligation of the arteries with the loop of thread. If you fear that the ligatures will slip, insert another needle with another loop of thread under the swelling in its entirety when the first needle is withdrawn
Tighten the threads in four places and make an incision in the middle of the swelling until blood escapes. Leave what remains of the skin and its contents intact, and apply an adhesive dressing to the area Then use the treatment that involves incision and medication until it heals
The five stages.
In the swelling which exhibits tension of the nerve.
Similarly, it also exhibits swelling in the arteries and veins as well as the nerve if there is a blow or excessive tension or any other cause which would be more severe in the sensitive areas
In every location where joints move, and a fatty tumor resembling the color of the rest of the body occurs, and is more common in its entirety than other swellings, and if pressure is applied with force, a sensation resembling pain is felt without the swelling being deep within the body.
It remains under the skin and moves in all directions, not towards the front or back. What is in the joints should not be fixed, for it may cause time and what is in the head or the brow may be affected
The skin should be opened with a curved incision, and if the swelling is small, close it with sutures and remove its root if possible. If it is large, perform it with a knife and drain it, then suture and rejoin the wound until healed.</start_of_turn>
Urgent and severe case.</start_of_turn>
In the sections of the intestines that are exposed in the abdomen.</start_of_turn>
It often happens with some people in their abdomen and throughout their bodies, intestines called the mesentery, which resemble the intestines of their origin, are thin and their heads are thick, their lips have become small and there is much of it.
I have seen men with swelling in their abdomen which resembled intestines, but they were not like the white, thin intestines of their origin, for their lips had become small and there was much of it. Only when I opened them and discharged their contents did they become lighter, weighing around eight or ten pounds in one case, and six in another.</start_of_turn>
The work in cutting them is that if the cause is moist and the color of the swelling is white and moist like the original intestines, cut it with a wide incision and keep your hand steady, for there is much blood loss when they are cut.</start_of_turn
If blood spills and pools, and you see little clots and fragments of tissue in the incision, take a strong suture and tighten it securely. Leave it for two days and then gradually reduce the tension of the suture until it is no longer taut.
Whenever the tissue is thick and liable to tear and slip from itself without advantage, if the tissue is of a tough origin in the belly, there is some fear and risk of its breaking through. This is especially the case if the intestines are involved. However, sometimes it may be necessary to cut through half or a part of it.</start_of_turn>
Then make an opening and do not close it until the wound has healed. Take care that there is no slipping of the tissue. Be aware that excessive tension of the suture may cause discoloration of the surrounding area, which may be cancerous. I will remind you of this when I discuss cancer later.</start_of_turn>
Chapter twenty-five.</start_of_turn>
On the treatment of tumors.</start_of_turn
A tumor may be caused by various factors, either by an ulcer in the abdomen from which blood or intestines protrude, or by a tumor in other parts of the body, or by blood that leaks from a vein or artery, or by wind that collects under the skin.</start_of_turn
If the ulcer is from the perforation of the abdomen and the evacuation of blood, it appears pale like the body and has no color. Various positions of the tumor become evident.</start_of_turn If it is from the intestines, it is more prominent and when you grasp it, it feels soft and often causes severe pain when entering the water and remaining in the bath.</start_of_turn
If a swelling appears in your hand and does not increase or decrease, and if it is caused by blood, it will appear black in colour. If it is caused by fat that has become necrotic, it will be a solid swelling and will be located on one surface only.
If it is caused by air, it is sufficient to look and see if there is a clot of blood or fat from an artery or vein or air, and if so, treatment must be discontinued, as there is danger and swelling as I have mentioned in the chapter concerning swellings caused by arteries and veins
If it is caused by a tumor from the intestines or the liver, treatment must be advised that he should grasp himself firmly and remain still for a while, and then learn by palpation around the tumor Then he must place his hand between his palms on his back and learn by palpation around the tumor. Then he must order that a broad bandage be applied around the swelling at the point which it was learned and be tightened from above the swelling to below the navel, and be secured with strong thread or silk thread.
The knot must be loosened, and the swelling should be opened up from above and your fingers should be put into the swelling and the doctor should be asked if the swelling has already been taken up by the knot. If the swelling has already been taken up by the knot, the swelling should be released from the knot and the doctor should be informed. If there is fat, it should be pressed down into the abdomen
The suture must be cut. If there is an artery or vein that has been caught, leave it for now and continue your work. Take two needles and pass them through the swelling four times at the point where the knot was made, and then tighten the knot firmly.
If the needle slips and leaves the tissue without cauterizing the surrounding fat, it will either encapsulate within itself or tear it. It should then be treated with suitable sutures until healed, provided the surrounding fat does not contain any foreign bodies.
Or if the swelling is large, it should be drained as we have mentioned, and blood or fluid should be removed from it. It should then be treated with substances that promote healing of the area.</start_of_turn>
Chapter Three: Bleeding.
In the Treatment of Wounds.</start_of_turn>
We have previously mentioned different types of wounds and how to treat them with medication and precautions to be taken in their treatment. We have also mentioned the types of wounds that occur in the womb and the precautions to be taken in their treatment.</start_of_turn>
The first part stated that if the wound is in a location that allows for its complete excision, such as those located in the armpit or thigh, and if it is small, it should be completely excised without hesitation. However, if the wound is large, it should not be approached carelessly.</start_of_turn
If I am unable to cure it or if I have not previously seen anything like it and reach that stage, and if the work is arduous as we have mentioned, it should be abandoned and a black salve should be applied several times before dissecting it if it is in a vein or filled with fluid.</start_of_turn
Then the black salve is applied to the wound and the surrounding area is massaged. The wound is then closed with sutures that will dissolve naturally without causing damage. The surrounding tissue is separated from the wound without tearing the blood vessels or nerves.
If blood flow is obstructed by a swelling or a clot, grasp the area firmly with your hand or any available instrument. If this interferes with your work, a great bleed may ensue from a severed artery or vein, causing clotting. Cut off the blood supply and apply all available treatment until the bleeding stops.
Grasp firmly with the hand or any instrument.
In the treatment of the wound
We have been informed regarding the classification of swelling types and how water and signs relate to each type, as well as treatment and medication. The treatment is specific to the type of swelling and does not involve ironing out any of the types.
If that is the case, if you have treated this type of swelling with medication and it has not improved, then perhaps the cause is weakness or another disease other than the swelling, such as an infection.
A spasm or swelling like that, if you treat it with medication and it does not improve, then perhaps the cause is weakness or another disease other than the swelling, such as an infection. If you see the cause and do not find weakness, do not proceed with the work until you have identified the cause and confirmed that it is only the swelling and not another ailment. The assistant behind him grasps his abdomen with both hands and drains the water downwards to the navel area, then takes a thick paste from this image
The extent of the incision is long and limited to the tip, like the thick paste, except that there may be a little pus. Do not go beyond this during work to the bowel, as it may cause damage, and remove it if it comes from the intestines
The incision should be made from the navel to below the pubic bone, approximately three fingers in length. If the bleeding comes from liver disease, the incision should be smaller, around three fingers in length. If the bleeding comes from spleen disease, the incision should be made on the right side, approximately three fingers in length
The incision should be made on the side where the cause of the ailment necessitates its placement, without compromising the surrounding vulnerable tissue. Then, grasp the skin with forceps and enter the incision with the instrument and elevate your hand.
The incision should be made on the side where the ailment demands it, without injuring the surrounding delicate tissue. Then, grasp the skin with forceps and enter the incision with the instrument, and elevate your hand.
It is like making a tube from a thin vessel, made of silver or copper or lead, with a small hole at the bottom and three holes on the sides as you see.
The tip of the instrument can be placed like a pen on this shape
The higher loop of the instrument, if the instrument reaches the water, will fall from its handle. It will drain the water gradually because if you drain it too quickly, the ailment will suffer from the loss of its vital spirit.
Or shows him swelling close to death, but its vital spirit remains strong. Then the instrument is withdrawn and the water is evacuated from the wound, for it has grasped it from its handle
Because of the skin which grasps the opening made in the abdomen which was informed to be closed by this mark, then the instrument is withdrawn again if you see the ailment closed thereby
It also evacuates a little water which is done in any case and protects from error until there is left only a little water remaining. If it is left in excess, the ailment becomes enfeebled and settles in the sand like dust
Heat is abundant in baths and the sun, and is applied to the pulse and the affected area with dry drugs until the pain subsides. It also soothes the stomach and liver after water is expelled, as described previously.

If the belly is large, extend the palm of your left hand over it and grasp the head of the uterus with your thumb or index finger as if sculpting something to make the navel prominent and the hole in the middle to match the navel.
And preserve yourself from blood clots by keeping the bleeding under control. Cover the wound with something that will stop the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals
Sixth chapter and fifty-fifth.
In the boil that appears in the groin, belly and thigh, swelling and pus, and adhesion of the thigh to the belly
This boil often appears in the uterus and is like a tumor of fat and becomes harmful and harmless. The harmless kind should be treated with a soft bandage
And cut it out until it is all gone, then cover it with coarse sponges soaked in oil, and then treat it with the balsam until it heals. As for the harmful tumor-like boil, it is necessary to use the needle after it is cut out and drained, to prevent recurrence
If the boil is in the groin and some of the boil is inside the groin and some is outside, then remove the part that is inside first, even if it fills up, as this facilitates the excision from outside.
Because if you treat them both together you will not be sure that the groin is not perforated, and there may also be swelling and pus in the groin, so you must remove everything that is black and bad and that which is swollen or rotten
Then cover it with honey and mustard seeds and lead plaster, and treat it with all treatments until it heals. If there is bleeding, use sponges moistened with alum to absorb it in this way
If the nosebleed and wound are severe, and the clot has detached and gone away at some point, it is necessary to insert a tube through the vein of the lip to reach the aorta. As for the packing of the wound with the clot.
The packing [of the wound] must be removed if the covering [of the wound] is intact, as it may cause infection. It should be loosened by puffs of opium until the clot is released and the clot is freed from all sides.
If its redness is discerned upon excision, it should be loosened somewhat, as the covering is thin and may easily tear. Then differentiate between the clot and the packing with a fine gauze soaked in cold water, so that it does not also adhere to the clot
...and be treated with astringents until it heals completely.
Seventh and Fifty-seventh Chapter.
On the purification of infants and the treatment of their ailments.
Excision is not merely the cutting away of tissue like other surgeries, for it is specifically with infants that we must be particularly cautious and meticulous in our work.
The easiest way to ensure safety is to abstain from excision altogether, as it is not mentioned in any of the earlier texts due to its absence from their practices.
Experience has shown that there are some physicians and surgeons who perform purification using various methods such as the use of sponges and scissors, and who employ sutures and ligatures and cutting with forceps. All of these methods have been successful
The best method is to cleanse with vinegar and bind with silk, for vinegar is often too strong for the covering of the wound and the upper layer of the covering has often been severed by the lower layer.
It is necessary to cut further and remove the surrounding tissue, and do not use vinegar as a cleansing agent, as it may enter the wound, and as for the sponge, it may leave the wound raw and spoil your work, or the patient's tissue may be thin by nature.
Indeed, these matters are not without consequence, and in my experience, I have seen many instances where such cleansing methods have been unnecessary. As for the sponge, it is often too rough and may leave the wound raw, and as for the vinegar, it is often too strong for the covering of the wound and the upper layer of the covering has often been severed by the lower layer
When you stretch your hand to grasp the edges of the wound, you should cut at the same time so that the silk will encase the entire circumference of the wound without leaving any gaps, and thus prevent any displacement of the tissues. The aim should be to minimize damage to the surrounding tissue, and for this reason, the upper and lower layers of the covering are often severed together with the lower layer
Certainly, if you are able to understand a little, you can tie the silk only around the circumference of the wound and leave it for a while, then remove it and stretch it out slowly. This is what you should do with your hand and not with your mind, then stop your hand from your shoulder
Do not be hasty and place the scalpel either in your palm or under your foot, for this will not benefit the patient. Instead, grasp the wound with your hand and gently stretch it outwards until the edges are brought together.
Then he removes whatever is inside together from the wound and ties up the surrounding tissue with a suture like this. Then he ties below it a little less tightly. He grasps with his thumb and index finger the lower attachment and pulls it inwards so that it is taut. He cuts between the sutures. Then he raises the swelling quickly and removes the tip of the vein. He leaves the blood to flow slightly. This is better and causes less swelling of the vein. He then closes with a wet dressing and covers it with burnt alum. This is better than anything else or the skilled surgeon's needle.

He then closes with a wet dressing and covers it with burnt alum. This is better than anything else or the skilled surgeon's needle. Then he supports the swelling from above in an egg-shaped incision filled with beaten egg white diluted with rose water and covered with fine rose water. He leaves it on for another day and treats it with all treatment until it heals completely
This image depicts the process of cleaning the wound
The vessel is cut through without any ligature. The length of the two branches is equal to the length of the graspers. As for the suture line of the cleaning, it should be deepened so that the swelling will go down completely, either by pulling out all of it or some of it when cutting. You should lengthen it from your forearm with your thumb and index finger before cutting
You cut it straight across. If you are unable to grasp it with your thumb and index finger, grasp it with forceps and cut it. If there is still swelling under the tip of the vein for three days and the swelling does not go down, leave it open and let it heal naturally without any packing.
Cut it as needed. Preserve the tip of the vein. If you cut any part of the vein, this will not harm the healing of the wound. This is better than what is recommended in the chapter on wounds
If pieces of brain extend above the amount and contract above the skull, this does not harm. It is much more harmful when it contracts below the skull.
The Eighth and Ninth Chapters.
In the treatment of urinary incontinence associated with spasms in the bladder
Urinary incontinence associated with spasms in the bladder is due to obstruction of the flow of urine by stones, blood clots, pus, fat or other substances. If these are treated as described in the previous sections, the groups of treatment mentioned will be effective
Urine does not pass even though it is obstructed by the stones in the bladder. This necessitates that the patient be raised up and supported by two attendants. One should place his hand on the patient’s chest and his other hand on the patient’s abdomen and gently massage the area around the stone until it passes
Sometimes the bladder neck needs to be forced to expel the stone backwards. In this case, if the stone does not pass as described previously and the condition becomes more severe, then it may be necessary to use a device called a catheter to remove it
A catheter is made from a piece of fine, smooth glass tube, like a bird’s feather quill, with a rounded bulge at one end. The end with the bulge is directed towards the bladder opening and is connected to a tube or bag of urine collection
The catheter is inserted through the lower part of the catheter and is connected to the patient’s urine collection bag if there is still urine remaining in the bladder to fill the tube. Then the catheter is oiled or greased or dipped in egg white and the patient is placed on a chair
The patient is instructed to urinate and then the catheter is inserted into the urethra following the bladder opening and passing through the neck of the bladder until it reaches the bladder. The catheter is then secured in place.
Until the wound has closed and the discharge has been brought inwards, until it comes close to the seat of the bone which leans downwards, and the discharge within it is then expelled inwards until it reaches the bladder and causes it to swell.
Until the wound has closed and the discharge has been brought inwards, until it comes close to the seat of the bone which leans downwards, and the discharge within it is then expelled inwards until it reaches the bladder and causes it to swell
Until the wound has closed and the discharge has been brought inwards, until it comes close to the seat of the bone which leans downwards, and the discharge within it is then expelled inwards until it reaches the bladder and causes it to swell. The reason for this is that the bladder is full of urine, and when the thread is tightened somewhat, the urine follows the thread, and is then expelled, and the urine returns, and the discharge is expelled once more.
The ninth and tenth chapters.
How to ligate the bladder with silk thread.</start_of_turn>
And this image shows the instruments that are used for this purpose, which are made of silver or ivory, and have long handles. The water and medicine are put into the container at the top of the handle.</start_of_turn
These are made of silver or ivory, and have long handles. The container at the top of the handle has three holes at the top and two at the bottom, as you see.</start_of_turn>
And the inflated bladder is placed over what it covers without adding anything else, until if it grasps anything of the fluids, it grasps and if it is expelled, it is expelled beyond what has been done to cause the wound to heal.
And if you wish to drain the fluids from the bladder, you insert one end of the silk thread into the fluid and grasp it with the forceps, and the fluid is squeezed into the container as described in the discharge. Then the thread is expelled from the wound according to what we have described in the discharge, and the fluid is expelled with the forceps.</start_of_turn>
If the moisture reaches the bladder, it does so gradually until the sensation of fullness is noticeable. This is a delicate injection also performed into the bladder.
A tube is made of gut or silk, its head is wider and resembles a small bladder. It has a neck with a knot that holds it in place. The bladder is then filled with the desired moisture and the knot is tightened securely.</start_of_turn>
The moisture is warmed slightly and enters the end of the injection through the urethra. It is then tightly held by the hand over the bladder until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.</start_of_turn>
If the bladder is not filled, take a piece of silk and form a circle with it and pass a needle and thread through it as if sewing. Then pass the needle through the bladder as if sewing and gather the circle as if gathering a wound after filling it with the desired moisture, oils and water.</start_of_turn>
Then secure it with an instrument and perform the injection as described for the bladder until the moisture reaches the bladder.</start_of_turn>
The Stone Chapter.</start_of_turn>
In the Chapter of Stone.</start_of_turn>
We have mentioned in the division of types of stones and their treatment and medications and have mentioned the difference between stones that form in the kidneys and those that form in the bladder and their signs.
Those that form in the bladder are special and appear in the urethra and I will explain it clearly and concisely.</start_of_turn
I say that the stones that form in the bladder are more prevalent among patients and their sign is that the urine flows from the bladder like water in a stream.</start_of_turn
Sand appears in the wound and causes it to harden, and it is necessary to wash it out frequently. Many patients suffer from this, and it is common for children to recover from it by the age of fourteen, while adolescents and adults take longer.
Those with large amounts of debris in the wound will recover more easily. If we proceed with treatment, it is necessary to first instill a solution that will expel all the debris from the wound, as this may prevent the presence of stones upon examination
Then take the syringe and draw up the solution and pour it down to the bottom of the wound to expel the stones downwards. Repeat this several times until the stone has descended to the pelvic region. Then place your thumbs between the buttocks and your palms under your knees to make the pelvis tilt downwards, and then examine the wound.
And if you feel a stone in the cavity, then immediately cut the wound open. If it does not come out on its own, then grasp the edges of the wound with the ring and middle fingers of your left hand if the patient is young, or the ring and middle fingers of the right hand if the patient is an adult.
If the wound is wide, insert it into the patient's buttocks and open the wound until the stone comes out. Then grasp the stone slightly and pull it downwards towards the pelvic region. Then close the wound with your fingers and push the stone outwards towards the desired location.
Command the servant to hold the pelvis with his hand and command another servant to grasp the veins above and below and grasp the skin under the veins at the site of the wound. Then take the needle and suture the wound as usual
The wound should be closed between the buttocks and the veins, not in the middle. The incision should be made alongside the vein and the fingers should be placed in the buttocks. The wound should be closed from outside and inside as much as possible in order to expel the stone
There is no greater swelling than that which presses upon the intestines in a stone-filled bladder when split and discharges without difficulty. Know that sometimes the stones have angles and letters that impede their discharge.
There is no greater swelling than that which presses upon the intestines in a bladder filled with stones when split and discharges without difficulty. Know that sometimes the stones have angles and letters that impede their discharge. Smooth stones resembling lentils and fragments that are easily discharged are harmless. But those that have angles and letters must be split or grasped firmly, as the case may be
The abdomen swells more from the pressure of stones in a bladder split open and discharging without hindrance. Know that sometimes stones have angles and letters that hinder their passage. Smooth stones resembling lentils and those easily passed are harmless. But those with angles and letters must be split or grasped firmly. If these cannot be removed, widen the incision slightly or if blood appears, wash out the wound with an antiseptic solution.
If there are more than one stone, evacuate the larger one first through the mouth of the bladder, then make an incision and evacuate the smaller one afterwards. Do the same if there are more than two. If there is a large one, do not attempt to make a large incision, as this may endanger the intestines.
Or the bladder may rupture and urine may leak out permanently for fear of damaging the intestines. Attempt to evacuate the stone until it passes or break it with instruments until it passes in pieces
When you have finished your work, wash the wound with vinegar and water, oil or balsam, and a cold compress. Keep the wound covered with a bandage and do not remove the dressing for three days.
When the intestines have relaxed and urine has stopped leaking, cover the wound with plenty of oil and balsam. Keep the wound covered with a bandage until it heals. If there is still blood in the urine, this is an indication that the bleeding has not stopped and the wound must be reopened
Insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood. If it persists, it indicates contamination of the intestines and their swelling. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water and salt. All types of treatment are permissible until the wound heals.
In all types of treatment, it is essential to bind the limbs and gather them together to stabilize the medications placed on the area. If the stone is small and passes through the urinary tract and causes obstruction to the flow of urine, this must be addressed effectively before it becomes a perforation
Indeed, many treatments have failed to address the perforation. This has led to the widespread use of iron nails in such cases.
Like placing a sharp hook in the limb, then passing a thread and tying it under the stone to prevent it from returning to the intestine. Then insert the iron nail through the opening until the stone reaches the same level as the nail
And rotate the stone slightly with your hand, and when you have reached the perforation, you will feel the blood flowing from the wound. Then close your hand over what remains of the stone outside the urinary tract, and it will rupture and come out with the urine, healing the wound
If this treatment does not suffice for you due to some obstacle that hinders you, tie a knot under the stone and another knot above the stone, then make a cut in the stone within the urinary tract between the two knots and remove it.
Then release the knots and drain the blood that has accumulated in the wound. If the knot under the stone is not removed, it may return to the intestine. The other knot should be kept in place until the stone has passed and the skin has healed over the wound
If you have tied the thread too tightly and lifted the skin too high, when you release the tension the skin will recoil and cover the wound as we have said.
The sharp division and the stone.
In the discharge of stones from women
A little of what is said concerning stones in women; for if one of them is large, it hinders the cure and brings on many evils; and perhaps a woman will be unwilling to be treated for it.
If she is a virgin or one of those who has covered herself and is modest, you will not find a woman who will consent to this treatment, especially with the hand and the elbow involved; for the position of the incision on the stone in women is far from the position of the stone in men, and requires a deeper incision
In this case there is danger; for if necessity compels you to do so, then you must take a skilled woman physician, and there are few of them. If you do not find one, ask for a virtuous and learned man, or take a woman who is capable and skilled in women's matters, or one who can interpret this art for you.
Open the wound and command her to make every preparation for the exploration of the stone. This is because if she is a virgin, it will be necessary to insert the fingers into her place and explore the stone, and if you find it, press it down under your finger
She will command you to make an incision on her, and if she is not a virgin, command the capable one to insert her finger into the upper part and explore the stone after she has placed her left hand on the hip and clasped it tightly
And if you find it, you must draw it out from the mouth of the hip to the lower part of its extent, and then make an incision on her at the side of the hip, at the origin of the thigh, from any direction that suits you, and feel for the stone in that place
The stone remains stuck beneath the impacted stone. Make a small incision first, then introduce the instrument into that small incision. If you feel the stone, increase the size of the incision to the extent that you believe the stone will come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones.
Some are small, others are large, some are smooth, some are rough, some are long, some are round, and some have veins running through them. You should know the different kinds so that you can distinguish between them. If blood clots, leave them in the powdered area of the wound for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone comes out, and be mindful of the instruments you mentioned that are used for removing stones from men, to assist you in your work. If you see blood clotting, and you know that it is from a severed vessel, put the ligature on the area
and tighten them firmly without causing harm. Leave them for a while and do not move the stone or attempt to remove it. Perhaps the patient will recover, and you can then treat the wound. If the bleeding stops after some days and the area is cleansed, return to your work until the stone comes out naturally.</start_of_turn>
The Second Section: On Stones.</start_of_turn>
In the incision on the bladder area.</start_of_turn>
The bladder is a collection of fluids in the white sac which is located under the testicles surrounding the testicles and is called the peritoneum. It may be in a special membrane called the mesentery.</start_of_turn
Until it appears that it is another testicle and is between the testicles and the white sac which we mentioned previously, and this happens only in the wound. This bladder is formed from weakness which exposes it to women so that they may suffer from it, and it is filled with this material which is sometimes struck by men.</start_of_turn
The colours of these humours vary, sometimes being yellow, sometimes red, sometimes black, sometimes white.
When water is mixed with the white fat which we mentioned previously, if it is in the abdominal cavity, the swelling becomes extended to the extent of the abdomen and appears egg-shaped, without any particular bulge since the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If it is in the serous membrane which covers the abdominal organs, the swelling becomes extended on one side like an egg
And if the moisture is between the fatty substances of the flanks and the white fat, it lies under the sense, and if you wish to know the colour of the moisture, pierce the swelling with a pointed instrument which has passed an image of the contents.
If we proceed to treatment with iron, it is necessary to order the evacuation if possible, and if you see the body filled, then let it lie on its back on something slightly high and put under it many incisions and sit beside it on its left side
and order the servant to sit on his right side, put his hand on one of the flanks and on the region of the abdomen, then take a large syringe and make an incision in the middle of the flank from the upper part to the lower part near the navel
The incision is made parallel to the line which divides the flank into two halves until it reaches the white fat of the abdomen and its contents are released, preventing further infection by grasping the surrounding area more tightly and cutting off the supply of blood to the infection
Then drain the abdomen with a large container and remove all the fluid, and separate the edges of the incision with sutures and spread the abdomen above without touching the abdominal organs which contain the fat and cut the omentum as much as you can either completely or in sections
Do not touch the delicate parts. If you fail to remove a piece, water will not return. If an egg has protruded outside the skin during your work, and you neglect to remove the piece, gather the surrounding skin with sutures.
When the operation is complete, treat all the wounds until they are healed. If an egg has burst due to another disease, tie off the vessels in the vicinity to prevent bleeding, then cut the spleen from the vicinity and remove the egg. Then treat the wound as described earlier.</start_of_turn>
If water has collected in both cavities, know that it has been doubled in quantity. Split the other cavity open as you did in the first instance, even if it appears that the work has been completed. Then wash the blood.</start_of_turn>
Insert cotton soaked in oil or ghee into the incisions. Make an opening from outside with another piece of cotton soaked in wine and fat. Spread it over the abdomen and place a bandage on top. Secure it from above with a bandage that has six corners like this image.</start_of_turn>
Then take two incisions and tie them together with cotton wool around this example. Make the corners that you will bind from the loin or cotton wool and gather them with a belt around the waist. One of the corners should be placed on the buttocks.</start_of_turn>
The second one should be placed towards the navel and the lower parts of the thighs, and the upper parts on the buttocks. Gather all the strings together in a belt around the waist. This bandage can also be made with silk instead of steel wire.</start_of_turn>
And take a soft sponge and scratch the lower abdomen. It is a protection on what we have mentioned until the white spleen exposed to water take another sponge like this one.</start_of_turn
It resembles the eye of the Greek, then it joins with that sac and it empties all the moisture, then it dilates the sac with the teeth and tears down the mucous membrane layer and cuts it according to what you are able to reach until you have obtained all of it and preserved from the yolk, without harming it.
And know that this work is harmless and protects against bleeding, better than the work of the incision. If it hinders you in the joint of the fracture or at a time of heat and swelling or bleeding or anything else that hinders you, then treatment which is appropriate for that which hinders you is to be reached
If the ailment is painless and you do not endure this work because you have become acquainted with it, then do not work on it on what I have described and which is better for you if it is as I have said, and if it is well with you from the matters that I have mentioned previously.
For the bladder is watery, so you must sit the patient on a high chair and join the swelling at its lowest point with a broad bandage and make a wide opening until the water has drained out completely, and then put on the place a piece of cotton and tie it.
Leave him to urinate the rest of the water, and elevate it until the wound is healed, for if you do not do this and the white membrane hinders the opening of the wound in preventing the escape of the water.
So it is necessary to insert into the wound a ball of lead or an instrument which brings out the urine which has advanced in its shape or lessens the opening of the wound a little
And know that urine will return and gather after six months or thereabouts, and if it gathers, bind it to its place and do not move the patient at all
The Third Chapter and Stone.
The Third Chapter and Stone. In the area of the testicles, their treatment and management.
Know that the swelling of these testicles originates from great harm, leading to their destruction in most instances. We see that leaving them alone and preserving their integrity is better than interfering with them. We shall speak of the work involved and the various kinds of swelling.
And we say that there are many swellings of various compositions which may exist in the body, some of which are composed of female elements and this is due to many causes, either from excessive fat deposited in the testicles or from injury, and the colour of the swelling is like that of the body and there is no water in it
The swelling is like leather and may be dark red in colour and cause no pain. It may be from obstruction of the arteries or from congestion of the veins, or from any other cause which makes the swelling obvious.
If you grasp it with your fingers and it does not cause pain, and if what is causing the swelling is congestion of the veins, it will not be relieved by pressing on it with the fingers. This type may need to be incised on all sides
And that you should make an incision in the scrotum, then draw out the testicles and remove them from the white sac, freeing the vessels and tying them off, and cutting the membrane after freeing it from all sides of the testicles. If the testicles have become united with those surrounding tissues.
The testicles must be extracted and cut out, and if there is adhesion between any of the sacs or the vessels, all of that adhesion must be freed and cut through decisively
If the meat of the wound is in a position of adhesion which is behind, all of it must be cut out and the yolk must be evacuated as we have mentioned. If you have performed this operation, wash the wound with wool soaked in oil and wine and then apply all the usual treatments until the wound has healed.
The meat of the wound and the stones.
In the treatment of wounds with stones.
The swelling is like a tumor which contains some twists like beads with relaxation of the veins which speeds up movement, exercise and walking. In the treatment of this ailment from the depths is close to what has been mentioned before
But it is necessary to mention what was done at the beginning. I say that it is necessary to sit the patient on a high chair and push the ankles of the veins downwards and grasp the genitals with your fingers with the vessels which are close to the penis.
And hold it up by someone else and stretch it out for a while until the vessels are exposed and then remove them from all sides as I have mentioned in the large veins of the buttocks then tie a thread in it
And tie it up in the first place where you have seen the swelling and also tie it up at the other end. Then make a cut in the middle vertically along the body and evacuate what is contained within it of the yellow pus and foul matter.
Then treat the wound with all the usual treatments which you wish to give. Do not be afraid to cut out any veins which are feeding one of the veins, for if the swelling has reached all the veins, it is necessary to evacuate one of the veins with the vessels to prevent the yolk from being eaten. Before cutting vessels, let them be at rest and do not harm them.
The incision is finished and the stone is gone.</start_of_turn>
In the treatment of abdominal pain.</start_of_turn>
This pain originates from a tear that reveals itself in the abdominal cavity towards the flanks of the abdomen where the intestines are, and the intestines are escaping from it through that tear to one of the large veins.</start_of_turn>
This tear may be either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its expansion, and there are many causes of this, either injury or swelling or disease or the elevation of something heavy, and its sign is that if it is from the expansion of the peritoneum it occasionally occurs over a long period of time.</start_of_turn
It does not happen immediately and the swelling is usually deep before the peritoneum tightens the intestine, and its sign is if it is from the tear in the peritoneum that it occurs from the front and its course is upward and outward and the swelling appears different superficially under the skin near.</start_of_turn
And thus the intestines and mesentery come out outside the peritoneum, and sometimes with clots of blood, and this pain is called abdominal and bloody, and there may be vomiting and there may be stool in the intestines and it will be stuck there, and there will be great suffering.</start_of_turn
Because it happens suddenly and with great pain and especially if it is at night, and the treatment for these ailments is difficult and dangerous, so it is necessary to be cautious in its occurrence, and the physician must order the patient to return the intestines into their abdomen if it is possible.</start_of_turn
Then he grasps on the edge of the abdomen between his hands and lifts his legs, then he separates the skin that is over the flanks and stretches the skin of the navel to the navel and makes an incision along that line as much as is necessary to open the incision.</start_of_turn
The wound should be as wide as can be without causing damage to the intestines, then the abdominal sacs under the loin should be opened until the white tough membrane of the intestines is completely exposed from all sides. Then insert your index finger into what follows the intestines.
Between the white membrane under the loin and the second sac and the adhesion behind the intestines, then grasp with the right hand towards the inside of the loin and with this the white membrane will be stretched upwards with the left hand and the intestines and the sac will be raised to the level of the wound.</start_of_turn>
And command the attendant to stretch the intestines upwards and release the adhesion behind the incision completely and explore with your fingers to ensure that there is nothing of the intestines remaining in the white tough membrane, for if any is left it will be brought down to the abdomen below.</start_of_turn>
Then take a needle with a thick thread which has been cut from ten threads and enter it at the end of the sac under the loin which is near the wound and pull it out until there are four threads remaining.</start_of_turn> Then complete some of them with some other in a stable manner and bind them firmly with the sac which we mentioned is under the loin with a strong knot from two sides and also tie the ends of the thread firmly so that nothing can reach them.</start_of_turn> So that there should be no swelling or pain and also a second knot outside the first one at a distance of less than two fingers. And after these two knots the intestines will be released as much as the breadth of two fingers.</start_of_turn>
So that there should be no swelling or pain and also a second knot outside the first one at a distance of less than two fingers. And after these two knots the intestines will be released as much as the breadth of two fingers.</start_of_turn> And cut the rest of it in a circle and remove it with the intestines. Then make an incision at the bottom of the loin which will discharge blood and pus as we have described previously, and cover it with oiled cotton wool and tie the knot which we described.</start_of_turn
If a white abdominal sac is suspected after a portion has been resected due to bleeding, it is left untied until it naturally ruptures. If its spontaneous rupture is delayed, heat water is applied to it and whatever is causing it is held until it ruptures.
The wound is then treated with all the usual surgical procedures until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 6: Stones.</start_of_turn>
In this rural area, this rural area, I have not seen anyone treat their ailment with iron. As we mentioned earlier, I will make as before concerning the first [instance], since after cutting it, we tie the blood vessels below.</start_of_turn
Then we cut in the middle and treat the tumor until the vessels are released and the wound is treated as we mentioned until it heals.</start_of_turn
Chapter 7: Stones.</start_of_turn
In the flank where there is a stone.</start_of_turn
It may show a cut in the flank as we mentioned previously, where the stone is located and does not descend into the intestines. If it descends, it does so slowly and returns every time.</start_of_turn
But if it persists, the cut in the abdominal cavity increases until the intestine descends and fills the cavity, and this is evidenced by the expansion of the abdominal cavity as we mentioned previously.</start_of_turn And thus it extends, then relaxes and returns to its place, and its treatment is as I have mentioned previously.</start_of_turn
It may be treated with iron in this way: he places a little on his back between his hands, then cuts the area where the wound is formed with a cut three fingers wide, and ties the surrounding veins.</start_of_turn
Until the white peritoneum is uncovered, take a loop and place it over the resulting opening, then close the opening to the depth of the abdomen. Then, tie the two resulting ends on the edge of the peritoneum and secure them with sutures.
Then, tie off the loop and do not cut the white peritoneum, do not touch the liver or other organs as I have informed you in the treatment of abdominal abscesses, and then treat it with surgical treatment.</start_of_turn>
If the sutures are cut, we will tie off the wound and leave it until it heals. The peritoneum will contract and will not increase in size.</start_of_turn>
And the best thing in this situation is peace.</start_of_turn>
The eighth and ninth chapters.
In the relaxation of the testicles.</start_of_turn
Often the testicles relax in some people without relaxing the tissues inside them, which causes them to appear large. Whoever wishes to treat them should lie down on his back.</start_of_turn>
Cut all the skin that has relaxed over the thick skin, then gather the edges together. If you wish, tie a knot with three or four sutures and secure them with the sutures. Then cut between the sutures.</start_of_turn
Then treat it with all the surgical treatments until it heals and the sutures are removed.</start_of_turn
The ninth and tenth chapters.</start_of_turn
In the testicles.</start_of_turn
The testicles in our religion are forbidden.</start_of_turn
It is appropriate not to mention it in this book, as it has already been mentioned for two purposes. Firstly, in the science of medicine, when asked about it. Secondly, we often need to specialize some animals for our benefit.
As for animals such as camels, dogs and cats, and the like, I say that specialization is upon two things: either by incision or by cutting and excision. As for the incision, we place the animal in hot water until its limbs relax and its muscles soften and become limp.
Then you should grasp it with your hand until it becomes limp and does not feel sensation when touched. As for excision by cutting and slicing, it is necessary to grasp the animal and immobilize its veins with the left hand, then cut around each pulse with a knife and suture the vessels together.
Until such time as two eggs appear, then cut them out after they are loosened and do not leave anything of the fat except for the thin membrane which is on the vessels. This incision is better than that which is by incision from the beginning
because it may leave some of the female organs still attached to the animal, which may cause it further harm, and then you must treat the wound until it heals
The Seventh Section.
On the treatment of wounds.
Wounds are of two types: one that appears in the belly or in the groin between the female organs, like a torn garment with hair and urine escaping from the groin.
And as for women, one type is above the navel on the abdomen like a small man with genitals protruding like two men, and the treatment for the three types is different
Different types of men and women should cut the intestines until their effect is gone, and then treat them with the treatment of other surgeons until they are healed. As for the second type of men from whom urine comes out through the scrotum – there is no action or sign of disease in them.

The Seventh Chapter
On the Treatment of Swelling.
Swelling is when a woman's limb becomes unfilled or when there is a small hole and either a natural or foreign body is present, for the foreign body may be an excess of fat from the limb.
It may be fluid-filled or blood-filled, and may be either in the abdomen or in the flanks or above or below the navel, and may prevent coitus, menstruation and childbirth, and perhaps even cause infertility.
If the swelling is close and does not appear externally, it is grasped with the fingers or with forceps. If the swelling is from fluid and is close to the flanks, it is to be pierced with the thumb and two fingers of both hands together
The woman should raise her hips and extend her flanks with force until the fluid is pierced. Then she should take cotton wool and soak it in oil and put it on the wound and change it every day so that the wound does not become infected again
If the swelling is thick and hard, it should be cut with a broad knife that resembles a sheet of copper. If the swelling is from fat, remove it with forceps and give medicine that will stop bleeding such as alum, saffron and vinegar together with egg-white.
Then use a wide tube of lead to prevent the wound from opening again, and keep it clean with lint, then apply all kinds of healing medicine until it is healed. There may be other plants in the abdomen like fat, so it is necessary to cut off this part also
If a tumor is not palpable and cannot be felt by digital exploration, it is not evident in the abdomen.
Third and Seventh Chapters.
In the treatment of dysentery, fistula, and the hemorrhoids that appear in women's loins
As for dysentery, it is excessive discharge of blood from the veins until it becomes copious, and if it progresses, it becomes fistula. We have mentioned its types and signs and will elaborate on them later on.
What precedes it is incurable, and what does not precede it requires treatment. I say that if the dysentery and fistula are deep in the womb and do not cause pain, there is no treatment for them. That which is in the mouth of the womb is what causes them pain. This is what is treated
The woman should enter the bath-house, then dilate the fistula with a blunt instrument or a rough poultice and cut it off from its roots. Then she should be left alone when there is bleeding from one of the arteries that has been cauterized without causing further bleeding
Like the vomit, feces, urine and blood, and we do the same with them. Then she should elevate her legs to the wall for an hour, and then bathe her in cold water. If the bleeding persists, she should be placed on a cushion and covered with blankets and urines. Then take a fine needle and tie it with honey and put it in the vein.
She should lie on her back. If the bleeding does not stop and the surrounding tissues are not solid, then cut the vein and tie off the surrounding muscles and veins without haste. Then take a sponge soaked in vinegar or in a decoction of pomegranate seeds or in strong chamomile with chamomile juice and hold it over the wound.
And if the tumor is active, massage the area with ointment until it subsides. As for the red bruise, it is like the head of a coarse hair. Cut off whatever appears of it as mentioned in the fistula, whether it is large or small, and treat it until it subsides.
The abdomen and the flanks.
The abdomen and the flanks. In the abdomen are the intestines which are revealed in the womb.
The intestines may be revealed in the womb in various forms such as cancer, abscess, hernia, ulcer, infection, polyps, tumors, and tumors of various types. All of these diseases and their signs are mentioned in their classification
It is necessary to mention in this section the abdominal tumor that appears in the womb, and if it is from the tumors that accumulate over time, how it should be determined in its entirety, and where it is necessary to look if it is associated with severe pain, swelling and fever
Or if there is a red mark on it, do not be hasty with its treatment, but rather let it stabilize until these symptoms disappear. If they do not disappear, it is necessary for her to sit on a chair with two legs and rest on her back.
She should gather her legs towards the lower abdomen and keep them apart, and let her arms rest under her armpits and be bound together with a bandage that reaches the navel
So then sits the patient on the right side and uses the instrument that opens the mouth of the womb, which appears later. It is necessary that if you intend to use this instrument that you advance it deeply into the womb so that what enters through the instrument does not exceed the depth of the womb
The ruler should be placed over the edge of the womb to prevent the instrument from entering too deeply, and the loop which is carried out by the instrument should be from the higher side.
You hold the instrument and the servant runs the loop until the mouth of the womb opens. If the tumor appears and touches the hand, and there is a lump, it is necessary to cut it off at its root with a wide incision, and if the entire mass is vomited
The wound should become wet and slippery with fat from rose oil or green oil, which should contain some clots. It should then become external through the opening in the neck of the uterus and emerge outside the uterus and on the abdomen, covered with clean wool soaked in boiling water.
Then it should be treated after two days with ointment which is suitable for this and will eventually heal it.</start_of_turn>
It is possible to wash the uterus and wound and to instill water and honey, then with boiling water, and then to return to the ointment if the abscess is remaining inside the uterus.</start_of_turn>
It is not permissible to treat with iron but rather with what we mentioned in the section.</start_of_turn>
Chapter Five and Seven.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the teaching of clot management as to how to treat living foreign bodies if they deviate from the normal course of action.</start_of_turn>
The clot should be aware or recognize the normal mode of birth, for its signs are if a woman feels herself descending to the bottom and gasping that she is unable to breathe properly.</start_of_turn
And it is easier for the clot to exit if you know that this birth is normal and that its exit is on its head and the placenta with it or attached to the umbilical cord, so if you see these signs, you must immediately grasp her abdomen to expedite delivery.</start_of_turn>
If, however, it has descended to its head, the placenta is also descended and will be cleansed from that filth cleanly, and this is not a normal delivery because the fetus may be born on its legs and its hands may precede its head and legs.</start_of_turn
If one hand or foot is alone, or if the head comes out and the hand or foot comes out, or if the brain comes out and the shoulder turns over, the container must be adept at handling all of these things without error or flaw.
I explain every form of it and its technique, so that you can rely on it and be confident. If the fetus comes out on its head naturally, strengthen the woman and support her. If you see her strength has waned, put her on a chair and order the women to attend to her.</start_of_turn>
And be mindful of the laxness of her womb and the fullness of her belly, and put your hand between her fingers lightly, so that you may grasp the navel or grasp it with your finger until the moisture comes out and she stops bleeding from her belly until the fetus comes out.</start_of_turn>
If it does not come out, then instill in her the teeth of the cord with oil of sharg and order her to move and give her a purgative to open her bowels and soothe her. If the fetus comes out naturally, support the hands or arms of the fetus slightly so that the fetus comes out smoothly.
If she does not open for the procedure, put the woman on a platform and raise her legs above the ground, then shake the platform on the ground and the woman grasps to prevent her from falling. If her hands or arms do not come out and the fetus does not come out, cut them slightly and grab the rest of the fetus.</start_of_turn>
Or bind her hands with a bandage and grab them gently. If it comes out, withdraw the fetus slightly. If the fetus comes out on its legs, support it slightly and turn the fetus slightly until it is aligned, then grasp one of her legs slightly and extend it slightly.</start_of_turn
If the [foreign object] comes out towards the thigh, command her to relax and bathe it with lint. If it comes out, praise her. If it does not come out as described, and a limb is left behind, reduce it slightly until it is restored to its natural form. It will then come out smoothly.
If the [foreign object] comes out towards the thigh, command her to relax and bathe it with lint. Praise her when it comes out. If it does not come out as described, reduce it slightly until it is restored to its natural form. It will then come out smoothly.
If you see that the [foreign object] has gone down towards her [genitals], make her a bundle from silk thread and hold it. If an hour passes, seat her on a chair, bathe her with lint, seal her mouth and nose, and press down on her abdomen firmly. The limb will then come out at that time, with her legs and arms.
If it comes out like this, slightly open her hand and hold it. Seat the woman on a cushion and pull down her skirt. She should be strapped to the bed and her arms clasped together. Press slightly on her abdomen. Then the limb will come out from under her thighs until it is straightened out. If the limb does not come out, grasp her thigh firmly and move it vigorously. Press slightly on her abdomen until the limb comes out above the navel. The limb will then enter the vagina and the foreign object will be expelled slightly
Command her to relax until the limb comes out. The limb will come out naturally with one hand outstretched. If she is unable to stretch out her hand, make her walk. If she is unable to walk, force her to lie down
Treat the patient and straighten her legs. Then apply the sponge which has been described from the teeth and take hold of it with your thumb and index finger and place her on a chair. Then treat her in return and restore the limb to its natural position and dress the woman and command her to move until she comes out.
Treat the patient and straighten her legs. Then take hold of the sponge which has been described from the teeth and grasp it with your thumb and index finger. Place her on a chair. Then treat her in return and restore the limb to its natural position. Dress the woman and command her to move until she comes out, her face towards her mother. Grasp the patient's hand firmly and turn her slightly, then straighten her limb along with the fat and other matters which we have described previously
Then command her to move slightly. If she does so, place her on the chair and command her to lean towards the right side. Then command her to move and give her some ointment when she comes out, as the patient comes out sideways from the flank.
If she descends towards the navel on this manner with the catheter, split the catheter with your thumb until it is discharged from the moisture. If it is attached to the face of the patient and her neck, remove a part of the catheter from the secret so as not to cause her death. Then bring the patient inside until she is placed where it is appropriate.
And command the woman to move several times until she comes out easily. The coming out of twins or many fetuses is often. Know that twins are often born and may be three or four, but this is something beyond nature and they do not live long.
And there is surrounding them, even though they are many, one catheter and it passes between them, related to the secret of each one of them. And they may come out as the single fetus comes out easily and naturally, and they may come out mixed as we have described previously.
If some of them are born with deformities and acquire forms other than the natural ones which we have described, and if these prove flexible and capable of conforming to the surrounding parts and moving smoothly without causing harm, then they are to be left alone.
Mention what is conceived in the womb of the offspring, for they may be conceived in one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or more than ten. And I have seen that a woman has aborted seven and another fifteen, all of whom were conceived in this manner
I praise the knowledge which God has bestowed upon us, for all this is but a part of the learned art that we possess. As for what befalls them like this today, it may recur tomorrow, and we are not to be afraid of it, for there is nothing which we have not learned that may be useful to us in this matter
The Sixth and Seventh Chapters.
On the Expulsion of the Dead Embryo.
If you are treating the dead embryo as mentioned in the previous division concerning treatment, and you do not expel it by hand, then you must observe her. If she is healthy and of strong constitution and there is nothing which threatens her, then you must place her upon her back on the bed
And her head will be inclined downwards and her legs will be elevated, while a servant will hold her hands from both sides or bind them to the bed, so that her body does not slip from the bed when the embryo is expelled
Then apply unguents of soft fat, with cloves of garlic and pounded alum, and smear butter over the vulva and insert the finger into the womb along with the palm of the hand, and then request a place where the nails of the embryo are not exposed, and put her in that place.
If the limb is swollen and hangs low on the head, the carpal bones pierce the eyes, in the palm of the hand, in the mouth, in the elbow, under the armpit, or in the regions close to the ribs or under the scapulae.
If it hangs down on the legs, it is in the loin or the middle ribs. The carpal bones must be grasped by the right hand and its wrist must be placed between the little finger and ring finger of the left hand, and the hand must be pushed inwards so that the carpal bones penetrate some of the places mentioned earlier.</start_of_turn>
Until it reaches something empty, then insert another or third carpal bone, if necessary, so that the grasp is even and does not incline towards any side, and that the hand is stretched out horizontally without being cramped only, but rather moves in all directions.</start_of_turn>
It will be easier to extract it as when you pull out a nail at its root. And it is necessary between this that the hand should be relaxed, for if you hold it firmly in one direction, it will cause some of the nails to slip out. So you should lubricate some of the fingers with oil and insert them from the side to rotate what is grasped, and when some of the swelling comes out, transfer the nails to other places.</start_of_turn>
A little more and it will come out. If the hand comes out before the swelling is fully extruded, and it is not possible to retract it due to its swelling, then it must be cut off. Then grasp it until all of the swelling comes out.</start_of_turn>
The same applies to the wrist or the elbow. And so it is necessary in the other hand and in both legs. If the head of the swelling is large and there is pressure on it during extraction, or if there is fluid in the head, then you must insert something between the fingers cautiously.</start_of_turn
It is not possible for me to provide a translation as the provided text is not included in the prompt.
If the head is large, the surgeon should drill a hole in the cranium or use forceps as we have mentioned, and then extract the bone fragments through the holes. If the head is large and the fracture is close to the chest, the surgeon should drill until the chest cavity is exposed.
If the chest does not close after the evacuation of the fragments, the surgeon should cut the abdomen or flank, or the buttock, until the chest cavity is exposed
If the limb is below the ribs, and its fracture is slight and its displacement is to the navel, or if it is fractured near the abdomen or chest, the surgeon should grasp it with forceps and cut the abdomen or chest until the fracture is exposed
If all the organs have been removed and the head and shoulder have been immobilized, if the abdomen is open and the hand can enter the abdomen, grasp the head with the thumb and pull it towards the navel, and with the other hand grasp the scapula or ribs and pull them towards the navel.
If the navel is closed and the abdomen is distended, it is not necessary to ligate the blood vessels, but rather to use sponges and sutures and sit in water that is lukewarm and apply pressure
If the limb is on the side and can be easily repositioned, do not perform the procedures mentioned in the living patient. If this is not possible, cut away the fragments and evacuate them. It is not permissible to leave any fragments inside the abdomen. After treatment, use the methods mentioned for treatment of tumors in the abdominal cavity.
If blood flows out of a vein into the gut, it descends into the water of the intestines and all other treatment is used. I have seen a woman who had swallowed a fetus alive and afterwards swallowed it again.
Then the other fetus also died. She displayed [the fetus] afterwards for a long time and put it in her vomit. It became so swollen that its belly burst and the mucus went out to her treatment. She used some strong medicines for it, but it did not heal.
It came out of its place and remained for some days. Then another bone came out of it. She was amazed at that because there was no bone in the place where the fetus's head had been. She opened the wound and took out many bones from the fetus's head
And she has not been following up on it until she took out many bones. The woman is now in the best of health, and she has lived for a long time after that.
Because there is knowledge and support from the physician's hand in treatment.
Seventh and Eighth Chapters.
There are images of the instruments needed for extracting the fetus
Image of a clamp that opens the cervix
This clamp is similar to the one mentioned in the books, whether for fetuses at the root of the umbilical cord or for those in the intestines. The length of the clamp should be such that it can grasp both ends of the cord, and its width should be equal to the thickness of two fingers.
And its handle is towards the fingers and its length is such that it reaches half way up the cord and its width is about the thickness of two fingers. And this is what is most useful in it, that it is of the same kind as the cord itself, and that its length is half a span or more, and its width is about the thickness of two fingers or more
The two that enter the mouth of the womb to dilate it are like another instrument similar to that which is used for the tonsils and the epiglottis.
The two that enter the mouth of the womb to dilate it are like another instrument similar to that which is used for the tonsils and the epiglottis. It is made from acacia wood or hippopotamus horn in the shape of nails, except that it has two grooves at the end of each nail, as you see in their length. And if you wish to dilate the womb with it.
And you sit the woman on a raised bed, with her legs spread apart and her abdomen between her thighs. Then you insert these two nails, which are like nails with grooves at the end, into the mouth of the womb. And you grasp the lower part of the instrument between her buttocks and open your hands with the instrument, as you do with nails, whether you want to dilate the womb as much as you like as much as you like, until you make the membrane that you want, as was mentioned at the beginning
The image of the instrument that is used to dilate the womb.
The image of the instrument that is used to grasp the lower part of the womb
It is like a pair of scissors in the end, as you see, and it may be made straight like nails in this image, as you see, and it has teeth like the teeth of a saw that cut with it and holds
The image of the dilator also
The image of the uterus
This dilator should contain little toughness so that it does not break when grasping the fetus with it, as the dilator has two holes/grooves.
The image of two wide pins to cut the fetus
All of these instruments, as well as other types, were available at the time of the author. It was faster for the craftsman and more expensive for the people, for it was not necessary for everyone to have them.
The Eighth and Seventh Chapters
On the Excision of the Uterus.
If the uterus is tight after delivery, the ruler must command the attendant to hold her still, then cut through the cord and grasp her mouth and [anus] with the hand. If it comes out thus far, well and good; otherwise take hold of it.
Grasp the covering with a hole and put in it herbs that are opened for the mouth of the uterus like figs and dates and chamomile and rue and vinegar and alum. Put some of these medicines or some of them in water and boil them and put a tube of silver on the hole of the covering and the other end in the mouth of the uterus
Fix it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus, then release it as we have said. The uterus will then come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and has not come out, command the attendant to smear her left hand with ghee or mustard plaster
Then put your hand in the belly and feel the uterus. If you grasp it and pull it slightly, it will come out. If it is firmly stuck in the depth of the uterus, put your hand as we have described until you find the uterus and pull it slightly on the navel cord.
Do not pull it violently, but rather shift the uterus to the sides right and left, then gradually increase the degree of pulling. The uterus will then respond and be freed from the adhesion. If the mouth of the uterus is wide enough, we have described the treatment of cauterization and herbs
If it does not come out as we have described, do not despair. Bind what comes out to the mouth of the uterus to the woman’s thigh and apply the cautery. It will clot after a few days.
If it becomes loose and comes out, except when it has been softened by heat, for then it will rise from it an offensive odor to the abdomen and head, which is harmful to the patient. Therefore, it is necessary to use appropriate incisions.
Therefore, some of the ancients used to make incisions with the knife and scissors, as an instrument which women use when they are in the throes of childbirth, for the retention of the placenta and the navel cord.
It is made from lead like a weight or made from copper, the narrow end is put in the belly and the wide end on fire and smoke is generated over the tumor, which holds it until the smoke has gone and the rest is expelled
The Ninth and Tenth Incisions.
In the treatment of a fistula not of the perforated type.
Many young men and women with fistulas not of the perforated type block them with a thin layer of fat, so that the intestines are unable to pass through them, and therefore it is necessary for the surgeon to grasp them with his fingers or to ligate them with a strong ligature that does not injure the surrounding tissue
Then a greased sponge is placed in the drink and oil, and it is treated with medicines until it is cured. If it is feared that the fistula will obstruct, a tube of lead is placed through the opening at any time and it is withdrawn whenever desired
The fistula may also be obstructed by a tumor or wound, in which case it is necessary to dissect that tumor or wound and then treat as mentioned above
The Eighth Incision
In the treatment of tumors which occur in the lower parts of the body
A tumor which occurs in the lower parts is a complex and dense one that occurs near the fistula from outside or inside and is one or more tumors.
If the incision remains closed and fluid is released, it may be pure or mixed with pus. Sometimes these purulent discharges may extend outwards to the skin and intestines, while at other times they remain confined. The confined discharge is known for what emerges from it in the feces and flatus when using little pressure.
The discharge may also contain worms. Sometimes these purulent contents may extend outwards to the bladder and rectum, or to the knee joint and thigh bone. The discharge that remains confined is known for what emerges from it in the feces and flatus when little pressure is used
Insert your fingers into the rectum and insert a handful of coarse powder into the purulent area, if there is no obstruction. If there is an obstruction, insert some coarse powder of lead or hair into it.</start_of_turn>
Until you feel the powder or hair in your fingers, and until you see no discharge of feces, urine or worms as we mentioned, know that it is not spread and proceed to treatment.</start_of_turn>
If the discharge has extended to the bladder or rectum, let the urine come out of it and do not obstruct the medication. If it has extended to the knee joint or thigh bone, mark the place and bring the powder there.</start_of_turn>
If there is no obstruction to the bone and there is pain in the area and discharge comes out, it is always better not to treat it and these spread discharges are all harmful without benefit.</start_of_turn>
Treatment for it is in the hands of the physicians who know how to treat it. As for what is not spread and is not harmful, please mark what I have mentioned and what you suspect, and do not do anything that may cause you to lose your finger.</start_of_turn>
If the thigh bone is displaced above the knee and the knee is flexed towards the abdomen, insert the hook of the needle or the clip if there is a fracture, until it reaches the end of the bone. When the needle or clip reaches its end, if you feel pain, move your fingers backwards into the seat.
If you feel pain in your fingers during the procedure, it means that the bone has slipped out of place without you realizing it. In that case, you must know that the bone has slipped and must not tighten it further as before.
It has been said that in some people it is necessary to place a thin pad over the fracture and gradually tighten it from within the fracture until it reaches the seat, and then release it several or three times
Until you learn that all the soft tissues that resembled the plumes of a bird have been burnt out, and then treat it with a tight bandage around the fracture until those tissues have come out, and then treat it with moist and adhesive bandages
And do not treat it except by other treatment, and if you insert the needle and it does not slip into the fingers, and there is a thick layer of flesh or fat between it and the bone, you will see the fracture from the surface of the skin. While you are perforating with the needle and it is in the fracture until it reaches the perforation, and the bone slips out of place and comes loose, then remove the soft tissues that resembled the plumes of a bird that are over the bone and do not leave anything of it
Then treat it with adhesive bandages until it heals, and if there is blood in your wound and between your work and your action to cut it, it is better that you do not do this and leave it as it is or take strong medicine because the fire of the medicine collects the two pains and burns those soft tissues that were burnt out.
Closure of blood vessels and swelling of moisture, then treatment with soaked sponges in vinegar or powdered gypsum mixed with oil until the area is cleansed and those burnt tissues are evacuated. Then, the wound is treated with the sutures of fine silk or gut.
These are medications which hold clotting and swelling, and if they are not given they will not heal and the swelling will not subside. If the cause of the swelling is deep in the tissue, after the surface of the body, put your finger in the swelling and open it up.</start_of_turn>
If you feel the spleen or intestines and you see a membrane of fat or meat which is close to the influence of the infection, do not do anything except to follow the path of the food and drink. This is because you may use one of three things: either you cauterize it as we have said.
Or you may cut it until it reaches its base to enable the insertion of sponges and treatment from nearby without damaging the surrounding tissue which would cause the evacuation of the bowels involuntarily. Then you treat it as we have mentioned before. Sometimes it heals as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Or you may remove that membrane and close it after you have cut it near the root as we have mentioned before, or with an instrument of sharp point then you evacuate those burnt tissues which are in the incision as much as you are able to.</start_of_turn>
Then you suture the wound entirely with the incision and surrounding area until it is closed and the swelling subsides. The patient should remain open in the abdomen for some time to reduce the swelling, and the patient is advised to remain in bed in this position.</start_of_turn>
And if you insert the finger into the abdomen and it is on the side of the abdomen towards the surface of the body with the skin and the edge of the wound, take out the sponge whole as if it were a needle on this image.</start_of_turn>
Insert a silk thread freely from five threads or thereabouts, then insert the needle with the thread into the anus until it reaches its base. If it is necessary to withdraw it from a sitting position from the inside of the rectum.
Insert the silk thread freely from five threads or thereabouts, then insert the needle with the thread into the anus until it reaches its base. If necessary, withdraw it from a sitting position from the inside of the rectum.
If the anus is not lax, do not force it, but if it is deeply congested, do not attempt to do this lest you tear the tissue. Then make as we have mentioned until it heals
The swelling caused by the abscess is severe at the front but mild at the back. Do not therefore attempt to grasp it lest you tear what does not need to be torn
The front is severely swollen, while the back is slightly swollen.
The abscess is full of blood, and it must be cut and treated for the wound
The abscess is located in two positions, either inside the rectum resembling large or small grapes, and there is always blood flowing from it
One abscess and many. It is outside the rectum except for these which are inside the rectum and are yellow or slightly bloodstained.
The treatment for the one inside the rectum is to order the patient to defecate until the rectum is evacuated and the pain subsides. Then grasp the fistula with forceps or graspers and cut it at its source. If it does not relax or soften, do not force it.
Perform an incision with a sharp knife or a lancet on the edge of the wound or grasp it with your fingers and cut it off. Then, burn the area around the cut with some intense sparks to remove any surrounding nerves.
Then, treat it with all available means until it heals. If it does not close by itself, ligate the small vessels with a ligature. This will cause the surrounding tissue to swell somewhat, which will wash out the remaining blood and facilitate healing. When the bleeding stops, the wound will naturally close.
Hold the tissue with your thumb and index finger, then cut through it. Then, treat the wound as mentioned previously until it heals. Do not use needles to close the wound as this may cause infection. Instead, use silk thread and a needle to secure the wound.
Then, tie off the bleeding vessels above and pass the needle through the tissue from one side to the other. Wrap the ends of the thread around the needle below and above, exerting tension. Then, secure the knot and withdraw the needle. Do this with all the bleeding vessels and leave one untied.
To drain the blood, place a wet swab or piece of lint over the wound and apply pressure with the palm of your hand or forearm. Keep the pressure on the wound until the bleeding stops.
When there is much purulent discharge and offensive odor, and the wound has not healed after a long time, it is necessary to drain the wound with a sharp knife or hook, and keep the dressing dry and clean to promote healing
Treat the wound until it heals. If it does not heal effectively, perform a deeper incision to remove the infected tissue. Then, keep the wound clean and dry to promote healing
The Third and Eighth Chapters
On the treatment of inward and outward hernias, as well as swelling of the belly and the scrotum.
A hernia is a swelling caused by an inward bulge in the abdominal cavity or scrotum that resembles a small head of a spear. It is most common in the lower limbs and toes, and is visible on walking, causing pain and discomfort
The swelling should be opened up around the hernia and held with a needle or bandage, and its root should be cut out. As for swelling of the belly, the simplest of it is a small, rough, solid growth that is fixed over the surface of the body
This often happens in children, and its treatment is to let the swelling go, cut it out, or tie it up with silk or hair until it falls off. It is treated with fire or medicine.
The inward and outward hernias can be treated with the instrument mentioned in the treatment of the swelling, while the swelling is a small, rough, solid growth that lies deep under the surface of the body, and if it is exposed to cold, it feels like a bite of an insect
It is common in all bodies, and most frequently in the limbs. Its treatment is to take a tube of barley or strong thread and make a circle around the hernia, and then turn the tube until the hernia is completely enclosed.
It is pulled out from its origin and its root is severed. If desired, the procedure can be performed with an iron or steel hook of this kind:
The tube should be placed over the root of the hernia without tightening it too much, so that the fingers can easily pass under it and grasp the hernia, and if desired, the hernia can be removed from the opening in the abdomen
The Third Chapter and the Eighth Section.
Regarding the instruments used for the retention of stool in cases of obstruction and prolapse of the rectum and colon.
The surgeon may make the [catheter] from silver or gold or from horn or gut, and of varying sizes according to the needs of the patient As for the [catheter] used in the treatment of young children who are constipated or have prolapse, it should be small, while that for adults who are obstructed or prolapsed should be large
The loop of the [catheter] which joins the bladder is wide in this respect and has a narrow opening through which the urine passes. The lower part which enters the rectum is smooth and flexible so as not to irritate the bowel in any way.
The capacity of the bag at the base of the bladder or slightly less and the urine which makes the bag of urine from the kidneys or from the large intestine is made into small pouches like lentils
There are many holes like this which are made to pass the urine, and between each two holes there is an interval of an inch or so. Then a thread and a piece of gut are passed through each of these holes and the urine is collected in the bladder like lentils in a bag If you put medicine at the head of the [catheter] between the two stones, tighten it and tie a knot, this is the shape of the full bladder and the closed bag
The method of its [catheter] instillment is that it should be filled with medicine so that the bladder or the intestines are filled with medicine, and it should be neither too hot nor too cold, and then the urine should be directed over it and the legs should be elevated above the level of the heart
He places a plug of cotton or linen under the wound, then washes the area with vinegar or urine or saliva or the like, and then inserts the instrument into the opening. He grasps the instrument with his hands and exerts force until all the matter in the wound is evacuated into the bowel.
Then he removes the instrument and directs the patient’s leg towards the wall. If the dose of the medicine is great for expulsion, let it be loosened as much as possible. If it does not evacuate even after repeated attempts, the dose should be increased until evacuation is complete
If there is swelling or tumors in the cavity, let the instrument be thin and blunt rather than sharp as is usual with the children. This is because of the swelling
The tenth part and the eighth part.
In the treatment of surgery.
It has been mentioned in the division of treatment that there are various methods for treating diseases, and I have mentioned here the treatment by hand and by medicine in its entirety. I say that surgery is different according to the thing that is contained in the surgery and according to the location of the wound
There are many things that are contained in surgery, such as a stone container or a sword fragment or a knife or a hook or a thorn or an arrow and the like of these things
And as for surgery according to the location of the body, it is different for a wound on the head or neck or chest or abdomen or liver and the like of these organs.
I describe the treatment of some surgeries to make them a measure and a law for all surgeries. I begin with simple head surgeries because their composition will be mentioned later in the third chapter of this book
When a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no bone fracture, if it is due to a stone or something similar, and if the skin has only been pierced and the wound is large, the swelling that ensues will be significant. It will not be delayed by blood spurting out in great quantity, for it will not stop until the cavity [wound] is opened from the side of the injury.
And if it is associated with swelling and vomiting, or with eating and drinking, it is not to be delayed, for it will not stop until the cavity is opened from the side of the injury.
If swelling occurs with vomiting, it is to be borne on the wound if it is soft with blood and has not been altered by air, which I will explain later. And if it has been altered by air, bear some ointment.
Until the swelling subsides and the air is expelled, if the wound is large and was caused by a sword or something similar and its edges have not approximated each other, gather it with sutures as I will explain in the suture of the abdominal wound.
If the skin has been stripped of the bone and is not stitched except for a little space left open, and the wound is treated with medicines that promote the formation of solid tissue instead of skin, and the swelling is reduced, let him feed on solid food such as heads of garlic and onions and the like.
If there is swelling in the skin and the bone has not been fractured, split the swelling completely and hold it together, for if there is a vein or artery that has been bleeding from it and has not been stopped by the medicines, open the vessel.
If a vein has not recovered after constriction, then cut it out of the place where it was bound and ligate the surrounding veins. If this does not suffice, then leave it severed until the blood supply is cut off. If these operations are small and simple, then they are easy to perform and require only the treatment of the wound.
Before changing the air, the description of the wound describes that it takes from buttermilk, some silk and from pounded or unpounded gypsum three parts which are equal in weight and put into the wound and covered and pressed firmly until it is firmly fixed and the wound is closed securely.
It is bound by blood and is held from above with silk, and is left without being closed as long as it does not swell. It may be that the plaster alone is sufficient if there is no buttermilk or other material available.
It may also be done in many large operations if its position is convenient and if the surrounding area is well-circumscribed by blood. As for the summer months, when the air is hot and dry, this should be taken into consideration especially when performing such operations.
Therefore, do not apply this remedy without taking into consideration the fact that it contains some pungent materials or applying some ointment composed of flour and honey until the swelling subsides, and then treat it with all the other treatments until it heals completely
Also, if there is a fracture of the bone and it is mobile, bind it with the dressing and do not neglect treatment of the fracture of the skull or neck, for the treatment of the fracture of the neck is different from that of the fracture of the skull if it is simple
And if a piece of bone has broken from the neck or an artery has been severed, there is no remedy except to bind them firmly with tight ligatures such as zinc and lead, for these cause the nerve to slip and become paralyzed.
Nothing cold should be placed on the wound, because the essence of the nerve is cold and it is connected to the brain, which is the most important organ. The medications which are commonly used for treatment such as camphor soaked in fresh water, or olive oil, or the application of rose water and alum.
If the wound is also washed with fresh water and other metallic substances on this property and moist bandages, and if the wound is large, stitches should be used or the edges should be bound together with silk, and then the wound should be dressed until it heals
If there is pus in the wound and it is deep, there is likely a fracture in its lower part. If there is a break in the vessel in the wound and blood is dripping, it should be cauterized or ligated or clipped if necessary.</start_of_turn>
If some of the tonsils or all of them have been severed and the blood vessels have been cut, gather the edges of the skin together with stitches on the collarbone. Do not touch the tonsils but tie the vessels in their normal place and tighten them securely and leave them for a while.</start_of_turn>
Then bandage the wound with moist compresses and leave it until it heals. If there is a fracture in the bone, remove it if possible. If there are pieces of bone remaining, hold them together or leave them until the wound heals and becomes easy to extract.</start_of_turn>
If the wound is soft, sprinkle on it the herbs that we have mentioned. The healing of the wound will be active in the chest and between the shoulder blades.</start_of_turn>
If a wound is inflicted by a sword or knife and appears to be severe, if air escapes from it, know that it is a serious wound. If it is not severe and is soft with blood, do not put any powder or herbs in it, and do not tighten it, for this will obstruct the blood in its cavity.</start_of_turn>
If the ailment is in the chest, insert a remedy there but make it thick and adhesive and solve it over several days. If it has not yielded, make in the mouth of the wound a small ball of lead to absorb the humors issuing from it and make the wound sleep.
If the ailment has persisted for three days or more, and there is no swelling, no palpitations, no distress or loss of appetite, and you have seen all the other conditions are normal, then know that the wound is healed and effective treatment has ceased.</start_of_turn>
If the swelling and pain persist, know that the wound is now healed and no longer requires treatment. The ailment of the chest or back is not cured by its outward symptoms, but by its inward progress as seen in the healing of the stitches.</start_of_turn>
If the wound is large or has fractured bone, and if it has exposed fragments, open the wound and extract the fragments if they are complete. If they are incomplete, leave them in place until they become detached.</start_of_turn>
The wound should be opened if it is easy to extract the fragments. As for other recent surgeries in all organs, judge them by their treatment as we have mentioned.</start_of_turn>
Fifth and eighth sections.</start_of_turn>
In the surgery of the abdomen and the evacuation of the intestines and their sutures.</start_of_turn>
The abdominal wound may be large, medium, or small. The large wound may expel intestines or other organs, making its entry and suture more severe and arduous.</start_of_turn
The small wound is also sometimes difficult from another side, so it is necessary that its response be severe with the intestine if it does not return to its place from its place at the time of inflation and distension. In this case, the large wound is better than the other two because it does not cause the intestine to be drawn with it.</start_of_turn
The closure of the abdomen is performed on four surfaces of the sutures, two of which are general and apply to the closure of the abdomen and other surgical procedures, while two are particular and apply to all surgical procedures except those involving the abdomen.
I shall explain them to you one by one, with elaboration and description. I say: if the wound is small and something from the bowel has protruded through it, and its protrusion is small, as we have already mentioned, or because the bowel has been distended by air beforehand, in such a case...
...in such a case, one must cool it and cover it with wet sponges or a wet pack or soak it in cold water alone or with vinegar and alum and bind it to the bowel until the air is dissipated
...it is better to use vinegar which contains alum than water alone in the dissipation of the air. If you see that the air has gone, remove the intestines from the water which has been boiled with cloves or alum, for it is soft and easily enters the intestines
If it is still not possible to extract it after this treatment, make a small incision in the wound slightly with the instrument which cuts nerves. The first treatment is better than the incision, but if necessary, the incision must be made. This is the form of the instrument: ...
The one end is fixed and the other is not fixed. The lower part is not tense but is slightly floppy. It is like a small spool as you see. If the wound is widened and the bowel enters, its protrusion should be in its natural form
And its place is specific to it. If you are able to do so, it is better. But if the wound is wide and is in the lower abdomen, you must assist it from behind and make its head higher than its foot. And if it is in the upper abdomen, you must make its head and chest higher than its belly.
If the wound is in one side of the abdomen, make your incision always toward the side where the surgery is higher than the other side. Thus it is better for great surgeries and intermediate surgeries.
As for small surgeries, you place it according to what you are capable of, then hold between your hands a helper who grasps the wound with both hands and sutures it together, and uncover it gradually from the person responsible for stitching.</start_of_turn>
This is a general rule of stitching that you take a needle or several needles of the size of the wound and leave from the edge of the wound as much as the thickness of the skin and then pass the needle through without inserting any thread into the edges of the skin.</start_of_turn> With the fatty layer under the skin from inside until it comes out from that side and has gathered the layers of skin and the layers of fat, making four layers, then it is tied with a fine thread around the needle several times from both sides until the edges of the wound reunite harmoniously.</start_of_turn>
Then leave some space also and insert another needle and then tie it with the thread as you did with the first needle and do not stop doing this until you have emptied out all of the wound and leave the needles of medium size between the thickness and the softness.</start_of_turn>
Because the fine needles are very quick and do not cut fat or tissue easily, it is advisable that they be of medium size between fat and lean, and do not insert the needle too close to the edge of the skin otherwise.</start_of_turn
Otherwise, it will cut the tissue quickly and open the wound before it is closed and will also delay the healing by not allowing the wound to adhere properly, and then cut the ends of the needles so as not to cause discomfort when sleeping and to make it easier for the wound to heal from all sides.</start_of_turn>
When the wound has closed, this type of stitching with needles is suitable for small incisions as it requires only one or two needles to secure the stitches.
Generally, the technique for closing a wound involves gathering the surrounding tissues with one or two needles, passing the needle through the skin and tissue layers in one continuous movement. The needle is then withdrawn from the opposite side of the incision.
The thread should be drawn down from above the wound so that the stitches are as strong as the larger stitches that are usually used to close the wound. This method is known to all people
The wound was on the man's abdomen. The wound had been caused by a knife and was deeper than a scratch. The incision had split the intestines and protruded outwards for about two inches from the middle of the abdomen
The patient was brought in after six days with the wound still open. The surgeon worked on the wound for approximately 15 days and it finally healed. The patient survived for many years thereafter and was known to be in good health. The doctors who treated him concluded that the wound would not heal without treatment
It is remarkable that I did not use any medication to treat him because I was in a place where there was no medication available. So I would put on the abdomen wound twice a day and would wash it with vinegar until it healed
As for two specific types of stitching, I recall what Galenus wrote about them, which is that one should begin the stitching from the skin and enter the needle from outside to inside. If the needle is withdrawn from the skin and the underlying tissue is parallel to the length of the abdomen, it will be successful
The incision is opened from the abdomen in the side where the needle has entered, and the needle is withdrawn from the abdomen through the opposite side, through the muscle. If the needle breaks, it should be withdrawn once more through the muscle from the outside inwards.
The incision is opened from the abdominal cavity in this side and the needle is withdrawn from the abdominal cavity through the opposite side, through the muscle. The needle is reinserted into the abdominal cavity through the muscle from the outside inwards until all of it has been withdrawn
The incision is made from this side of the abdomen and the needle is withdrawn from the abdominal cavity through the opposite side through the muscle. The needle is then reinserted through the muscle from the outside inwards towards the abdominal cavity until it has been completely withdrawn.
The incision is made from this side of the abdomen and the needle is withdrawn from the abdominal cavity through the opposite side through the muscle. The needle is then reinserted through the muscle from the outside inwards towards the abdominal cavity until it has been completely withdrawn, and this is repeated until the entire wound has been closed.
The incision is made from this side of the abdomen and the needle is withdrawn from the abdominal cavity through the opposite side through the muscle. The needle is then reinserted through the muscle from the outside inwards towards the abdominal cavity until it has been completely withdrawn, and this is repeated until the entire wound has been closed. This is how Galen describes the second type of suture mentioned previously
The incision is made from this side of the abdomen and the needle is withdrawn from the abdominal cavity through the opposite side through the muscle. The needle is then reinserted through the muscle from the outside inwards towards the abdominal cavity until it has been completely withdrawn, and this is repeated until the entire wound has been closed. This is how some physicians suture the wound and gather all the parts together. In doing so, they join the abdominal cavity to the opposite side and the muscle to the opposite side
The needle should be inserted through the closer margin from outside and passed into its interior alone. Then the fatty margin should be evacuated and the needle should be passed from outside into the interior of the fatty margin on both sides and then withdrawn once more.
The needle should be passed from inside to outside through the opposite margin which is on the opposite side, and this method of stitching is better than the common easy stitching which is mentioned earlier. This is what Galen has reported, and some people have said that the stitching of the abdomen with two needles is sufficient.</start_of_turn> And thus, one thread is sufficient. The needle should be introduced from you and passed to the other side, and the other needle should be introduced from the opposite side and passed to you. The needle should be withdrawn according to the stitching of the sacs, whether simple or complex.</start_of_turn>
And know that if the defect is in the middle of the abdomen, its stitching is more severe than that of other parts of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its rule is like that of all other wounds. If you have closed the wound early with blood before the air and the intestines have expanded and become taut, and if you have tightened it firmly, it will bear the burdens of the swelling.</start_of_turn>
If the wound has been filled with air, it will bear some of the swelling which is inherent in it until it collapses and drops the sutures and the fatty margin and then it is treated like any other wound until it heals.</start_of_turn>
If you do not give it any medication, it will bear some swelling from the start until it collapses several times a day as I have mentioned until it heals. In most cases, this is sufficient and there is no need for further treatment if the wounds are simple. But if you are afraid that the wound may involve the major organs in its pain, then you should take precautions.</start_of_turn>
If wool is wet with lukewarm oil or rose butter, and is applied around the area between the navel and the ribs, and if pain or stiffness is felt in the abdomen, this often indicates that there is an underlying cause which has not yet manifested itself.
Otherwise, if the swelling has reached the intestines and caused them to rupture within the abdomen, and you know that the intestines were not thick, they are easier to relieve than if they were thin
As for the large intestine, known as the colon, it does not tolerate surgery well because of its abundance of blood vessels and bones, and its tough consistency. If, however, what protruded from the wound is soft and you perceive its progression, remove it according to your assessment of the condition of the intestine whether it is alive or dead.</start_of_turn>
If it has been a while since the wound was made and has become black or green, you should tie a thread above the blackened area to prevent bleeding. If there are blood vessels and nerves, cut away everything except the main vessels and nerves, and then tie off what remains securely.</start_of_turn>
And make the two ends of the thread pass outside the wound so that you can easily remove them when the bleeding has stopped and the wound has healed, mentioning the wound which is showing in the abdomen, for if there is a break in the intestine and it is small.</start_of_turn
It may be sufficient in some people for one to see a person who has had an incision in his abdomen with a knife and the wound is to the right of the navel, and the wound has become necrotic and pus is coming out of it, making the patient think that the situation is not serious.</start_of_turn So do not be hasty in your judgment until you have carefully examined the area and are certain that there is no serious underlying condition in the abdomen which would make the situation worse.</start_of_turn> When the body is healthy and well-nourished, it naturally defends itself. Experienced practitioners have observed that when an injury appears in the belly of a small patient, it is often best to leave it alone.
When large worms are seen on the surface of the wound, they should be removed first. Then, the edges of the wound should be approximated, and a worm should be placed inside the wound with its head protruding. If it grasps and tightens its jaws, cut off its head. Then, another worm should be placed near the first one.</start_of_turn>
Do not repeat the process after having placed several worms in the wound, then closing and stitching it. If those heads remain grasped within the abdomen until the abdomen swells and relaxes without any discomfort, it is possible to also ligate the intestine.</start_of_turn>
One of the Egyptians has a living animal which he ties to a needle when it enters, and he lets go of it when he has grasped it, then he ties it securely with a thread and enters the needle once more.</start_of_turn> He ties the intestines with the Egyptian thread and pulls them out, then enters the needle once more. This is the way of stitching, tying and the worm, for it is on the way of healing and hope.</start_of_turn>
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in the small intestine, there is no remedy or any method to prevent the discharge of pus, except by ligation.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 6 and 8.</start_of_turn>
On treating ulcers and swellings.</start_of_turn>
Know that every wound or swelling that has remained unhealed and has become a ulcer, and which has always discharged pus, is called a fistula in any organ in which it exists.</start_of_turn
The truth be told, there is great difficulty in treating the white swelling of the belly, and there is no remedy for it except for an incision like that of the feathers of a bird.
Indeed, there is great difficulty in treating the white swelling of the belly. Some call it a feather, and at times it becomes thick, stretching the discharge indefinitely, and sometimes the discharge ceases and at other times it becomes abundant and sometimes thick and sometimes thin.
There is no healing to be found in incisions which leave flesh unhealed, for indeed this is the case with nine causes, among which are either a deficiency of blood in the body, or a sluggishness of the humors, or because there is flesh of the belly remaining within the wound. Or because of excessive pus and filth, or because of its size, or because of the infection which exists within it, or because of the incompatibility of the remedy with the condition, or because of gangrene that has occurred in the bowels from the pus, or because of some specific matter in the bowels.
Or because of excessive pus and filth, or because of its size, or because of the infection which exists within it, or because of the incompatibility of the remedy with the condition, or because of gangrene that has occurred in the bowels from the pus, or because of some specific matter in the bowels. As was mentioned in the city of Seville, where there is a scarcity of nourishment and an abundance of tumours, and where the doctors there restrain tumours by nature, or because of the vastness of the bone, or because of several bones. All of these causes and their signs and treatments are discussed in the division
It is necessary to know here the treatment of boils and carbuncles, which is by the work of the hand. I tell you that boils may occur in all parts of the body, as in the head and large veins, or nerves.
Or in the liver or spleen or stomach or intestine or bladder or ribs or backbone or shoulder or hip joint, with many other variations like the hand and foot, and some of them are close to vital organs and some are far from them
Whatever of these lesions does not respond to treatment and remains constant despite application of the utmost care and attention, is beyond the power of our remedies and methods.
Whatever of these lesions does not yield to treatment and persists despite our utmost care, is beyond the reach of our remedies and methods.

If the tissue does not heal properly, do not be hasty to repeat the procedure. If it still fails, do not advance to more advanced methods. If the cause of the lesion is a bone fracture, address that first as instructed.
If the bone, nerve or major organ is exposed and there is some decay and swelling, uncover it until the decay has gone, then cover it with what will hold it until it heals, if it does not heal and the swelling persists as before.
Do not neglect any portion of the infection; uncover all that is affected, then wash the surrounding area and remove the discharge completely, then cover it again. If it does not heal, know that the infection is far from the original infection, uncover all that is affected once more.</start_of_turn>
And remove the discharge completely from the surrounding area. The fractured bone may be large or small; you can grasp it with clamps that are suitable for that.</start_of_turn>
If there are many bones, grasp them all and do not leave any of them undone. If anything hinders you from tying them, do not cut them. Break those ligaments without danger and save the bone.</start_of_turn>
If you are unable to extract the bone promptly, carry on the wound what protects it and leave it for some time until the surrounding tissue has healed. Preserve the wound without tension, which may cause the suture to slip from the work you have done.</start_of_turn><end>
Do not put anything on it if you fear that. Put a soaked cotton pad in powdered sulfur with oil or a soaked cotton pad in Egyptian resin or any other ointment. If it becomes infected, those ligaments will become loose and the bone will be easy to extract.</start_of_turn>
If a large bone, such as a thighbone or a femur, is fractured and only the surface is affected, cauterize the surrounding area until the blackening and putrefaction have subsided. Then, close the wound. If a large portion of the bone is affected by the fracture and putrefaction has spread throughout the bone, it is necessary to expose the fracture.
Expose the entirety of the fractured area until the putrefaction subsides. Then, perform dressing changes until healing is complete. I inform you that this method was utilized for a man with a leg fracture recently.</start_of_turn>
Approximately three days elapsed before the condition reappeared in the leg due to an internal cause that prevented movement. Material protruded from the leg and caused significant swelling, without any external cause. Treatment was delayed by the actions of the physicians until the swelling subsided.</start_of_turn>
Many materials were introduced and the treatment was poor, causing significant swelling in the leg. Many physicians were involved over the course of two years, but there was no skilled craftsman among them.</start_of_turn>
Until recently, the leg remained swollen and material continued to exude from the wound. The patient developed severe pain and his complexion became pale. A sponge was placed inside one of the wounds and the sponge was pulled out, along with the surrounding tissue.
Some of the material had migrated to various parts of the leg. An incision was made on one of the wounds to expose some of the fractured bone. The fracture was badly damaged, blackened, putrefying and bleeding profusely. The hole was enlarged until the fracture was completely exposed.</start_of_turn>
The exposed fracture was blackened and significant putrefaction was observed. The remaining bone was deemed unfit for healing. The wound was closed and additional medication was administered for a longer period of time. The dressing was changed once again.</start_of_turn
The pus has spread throughout the bone and has burst forth what was also visible of it. Then it was lanced, but it did not yield, neither did it abate. It was then stripped away also, but it did not break off a portion of the bone. It was left open, and did not yield until a piece of the bone was chipped away towards the marrow.
It was evacuated with the bone fragments, then bound with drugs. It subsided quickly and healed. However, this repetition was necessary in this work due to the weakness of the patient and the small probability of success, and the fear of death because it often happened to him during excessive vomiting, which caused swelling of the vomit and healing was achieved only after evacuation of a portion of the bone fragments
It became fixed in the place of the bone, and reached its limit in his body and became weakened in his condition and suffered from his condition, but did not stumble due to the edema caused by the vomit, which did not cause him any harm, except that if a piece of the bone in any place of the body had fractured, it had broken.
Therefore, one should grasp it with a bandage and tighten it at the fractured end, and order the one who brings it to bring it up and make another bandage of finer wool than the first one.
Then it should be bound to the fatty tissue under the bone and pull down its end so that the fatty tissue is drawn downwards, and uncover the area where you wish to grasp to prevent the saw from injuring the tissue, and put a splint or board under the bone from below to support it
For if you did that, the saw would not deviate from cutting the diseased bone, and it is necessary for the grasp to be above the site of the pus somewhat so that it does not penetrate the bone and that it appears in the vision, and you will be forced to grasp it again.
If the bone is swollen and rigid, and some of it is affected by decay in the middle or in some of it, then uncover the meat from all sides. Then place the sliver from beneath and expand it from the first side where the decay is.
If you have finished expanding it and it is still rigid from the other side, leave a little space away from the decay. If the decay is in a joint, cut through the affected portion of the joint and expand the bone from the other side.
If the decay is between two joints, there is no remedy except excision. If the decay is in the forearm or the leg, the treatment is difficult but you must remove the decay completely and dress the wound appropriately.
And in any case that it does not impede you, when there is no vein or nerve, and you know that the cutting of these bones is many in number according to the position of the bone and its ligaments and tendons and their breadth and thickness and their distance from each other. Therefore, one must use an appropriate instrument for each type of work.
You must know that these works themselves often indicate the type of instrument you need if you have sufficient expertise and are familiar with the arts of this profession, for indeed, proficiency in surgery and awareness of diseases is one of the greatest arts For indeed, you can learn from yourself what is suitable for each disease, and in the end of this book there are many instruments mentioned
Therefore, they become examples to each other and a measure of each other, as God wills

Major Suture
This major suture is performed with a hook-shaped needle and silk thread, and the knot is made in the shape of a clove. It is used for closing large wounds or fractures of bones and joints, as well as for wide and deep wounds. The final suture is usually smaller in size than the others.
The final suture is usually smaller in size than the others.
It is made with a higher arch and a wide loop from iron and is secured with a nail from a seasoned stick with a blunt tip, so as to cause no harm
The final suture is usually smaller in size than the others
The final suture is usually smaller in size than the others and is secured at the tip
The final suture is usually smaller in size and resembles a needlepoint
The final suture is usually smaller in size
The knot at the end of the suture is like a clove and is used in many places on the limb, so as to prevent what has not been closed from opening again
The knot is like a clove that is made from iron wire and also should be made from all that we have mentioned of needles and sutures, so as to cause no harm
The Seventh and Eighth Chapters.
On the cutting of limbs and the spreading of bones.
The limbs may become stiff either from an external cause or an internal cause. If this is treated with medicine only and the swelling does not go down, and if the swelling increases in the limb and does not regress, then it is necessary to treat the wound again and prevent its recurrence
It is better to amputate the diseased limb at the point where decay has reached, rather than to risk death or great suffering. This indicates that the disease is widespread and that the limb will ultimately succumb to the fire of decay.
Or it is better to cauterize after the decay has spread, until it reaches that point where the limb can be amputated. This includes cases where the source of the decay is a swelling such as a tumor, or worms like sea worms or snakes, or boils, and the like.</start_of_turn>
If the decay or swelling is in a finger, amputate only the finger and do not allow the decay to spread to the hand. Similarly, if the decay is in the hand, amputate only the hand and do not allow it to spread to the arm.</start_of_turn>
And if the decay has reached the arm, amputate only the arm at its joint, if that is where the decay has reached. If the decay has spread further, do not amputate the arm to the shoulder, for that would be unnecessary and might cause death.
Similarly, if the decay is in the foot, amputate only the toe at one of the joints, and if the decay is in the leg, amputate the leg up to the knee joint.
If the decay has reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to leave it and allow the patient to die. Describe the amputation of the limb or cauterization, and tie a band around the lower part of the limb that you wish to amputate and another band above the limb that you wish to amputate.</start_of_turn>
And tie one band down and another band above, and remove all the fat between the bands with a broad blade until the fat is completely exposed, then amputate or cauterize, and tie from all sides with gut.</start_of_turn>
If the sharp instrument is placed accurately in the area of little pain and swelling, and blood vessels are opened during the procedure, immediately withdraw the instrument or clip off some of the blood vessels and then continue the procedure until the bleeding stops.
Then bind the wounded part securely with a bandage and treat it until it heals, and I will tell you about a similar case in which the limb was exposed with redness resembling fire.
That was the lesion which occurred first in his toe until a man took hold of all of it when he did not see that the lesion was spreading in the limb with intensity, except for the pain and swelling only which appeared at the joint, so it healed.
And so, when a long time passed, he saw that the lesion had spread in his hand, so he abandoned it and made an incision and applied some medicine after cleaning the wound, and the swelling subsided and the bleeding stopped
until he cut off his hand, and he left it with only hope that the lesion would subside, and also with fear of death because of the strength of the pain in his hand, so he did not despair and went to his home
I heard that he healed his hand completely without any amputation, and I tell you this story as a warning against this kind of disease and as a proof to work on it
Chapter Eight and Nine.
On treating abscesses and the way of injecting medications.</start_of_turn>
If an abscess occurs in some organs that are painful and prolonged swelling continues until a period of time has elapsed, then it should be opened and all the pus should be discharged, and the remaining tissue should be left empty as if it were a vessel
All skin which has become like a burn has become inflamed and does not remain quiescent, and does not affect bone or nerve or tendon. From this it is worthy of being called a wound, and not an abscess, until it persists to such an extent that it affects any of these structures.
Skin that has become like a burn is called an abscess or wound. Its treatment is to excise all of the affected skin as it rotates, especially if it has become like a burn and is inflamed, and it is evident that it will not adhere to its place due to its infection
If it is thought that the skin will adhere, and it is not evident that the infection has reached a great extent, and if the fatty skin is thick and active, it is sufficient to look at the wound and if it is large and the foul discharge which comes from it is offensive, it is treated with the local medication.
It is composed of olive oil, honey, cinnamon, and parts of either cloves or dates, which are cooked over a fire until the medicine is thick. Then take some of it and apply it to the wound with honey and water, and inject it into the abscess and close the mouth of the wound and leave the medicine inside for two hours.
Then remove it and renew it every day until the abscess is healed and the discharge has gone away. It is also possible to inject with lukewarm water if this medicine has not been prepared. This is done by taking lukewarm water of carob or pomegranate and adding water to it.</start_of_turn>
Then cleanse and inject it until it is evident that the abscess has subsided. If there is still a possibility of the infection not being eradicated, it is possible to add some powdered cinnamon to water and vinegar.</start_of_turn>
Or mix honey with vinegar because honey will cleanse and vinegar will soften the abscess, especially if there is excess fat and pus in it. If you do this several times and are certain that the abscess has gone, then mix vinegar with honey in it.</start_of_turn>
If the opening of the wound is too tight to permit the passage of the needle and suture material, or if the opening is in a difficult location, one may remove some of the surrounding tissue and then re-approximate the wound with finer material.
If the wound is too narrow to admit the needle and suture material, or if it is in a difficult position, some surrounding tissue may be excised and the wound closed with finer material. If the mouth is also wide, its edges may be approximated by sutures without further tension
If the lip which is being sutured is high, it should be placed below the level of the wound so that the fat does not obstruct healing.</start_of_turn>
If the wound is too deep to reach the lower lip, do not suture the lip toward the lower portion of the wound as this could trap fat and impede healing.
As for the medications which are applied externally to the wound and those which are placed inside, it is recommended that you take some of the common medications which have been shown to be effective in treating wounds and apply them to the wound surface without causing excessive tension. Then, using forceps, grasp the lip of the wound slightly wider than the opening and suture from the inner aspect of the wound to the outer aspect with fine sutures that do not excessively tension the wound.
Several days later, and as for the lip which was sutured, remove any discharge which may be present at any time to determine the amount and type of secretion which is escaping from the wound.</start_of_turn>
If the hidden pocket itself is affected, assess whether it contains pain or not, swelling or not, and whether there is any tumor or not. If treatment persists and the material ejected easily escapes through the hidden pocket's orifice.
If the pocket is firmly adhered or slightly detached, leave it for a day or two before performing a revision. When the wound has healed, exchange the dressing and apply new ointment. If the material has not escaped after a long period of time, do not be afraid of its accumulation.
He is close because some people delay the discharge of fat from their wounds and others hasten it. If the material escapes from the pocket after a number of days, it is not thick or viscous. Know that the pocket has not adhered and that the delay in its discharge is not harmful
The matter is prolonged because of the drying of the medications and because the medications are thick and viscous like beeswax. If there is an excess of fat, do not be afraid to increase the number of stitches. As for what alleviates the pain, know that the application of beeswax is beneficial
He will solve it with water and urine and sprinkle on it old wine. Mix them together and apply. He will do the same even if he has not applied beeswax, or if he has applied but it has dried and become unusable. Then he will apply it to the orifice and bind it to the pocket or apply beeswax that has been cooked until it is thick and let it dry. He will put the dressing on the wound and bind it securely
He may use long barley, poppy seeds, chamomile flowers and saffron individually or together. Apply them to the wound and bandage securely. If the condition of the pocket has not improved with this treatment, know that there is an underlying cause.
The treatment may influence the bones or other solid organs or active ligaments in the management of the disease as it progresses.
The Tenth Chapter.
In the treatment of tumors and fractures, the disease process is stopped and bones are fractured and the joints are opened.
A tumor is a large piece of flesh that grows under the nail of the thumb or finger and sometimes in all the joints, and if it is prolonged and neglected, it swells and becomes painful
Or it becomes soft and slushy until it consumes the nail completely and sometimes reaches the bone, causing it to have a foul odor and the tip of the finger becomes swollen and dark, and if you treat it as we mentioned previously and the treatment does not improve.
It is necessary to cut off all the tissue that grows from the nail and then suture the wound afterward. This is of great benefit, and if the bone is sound and the nail is also sound
and if the corner surrounding the nail has adhered to the flesh and caused it to swell, it is necessary to place a foreign body under the corner of the nail and raise it up and cut that tissue along with it
and put on the rest of the flesh antiphlogistic medications and cover it until it heals, and if the infection has affected the bone, it is necessary to cut that bone and remove it if it does not heal even after treatment of the infection
If you see swelling and infection spreading in the joints, do not delay treatment until it is too late. Treat it immediately until it heals, and if the nail is struck or fractured and causes severe pain, remove the nail or piece of bone immediately
If the swelling is deep and severe, make an incision from above the swelling to below it, preserving the surrounding tissue from excessive damage. If you do not do this, the swelling will reach the underlying muscle, which will cause excessive swelling in the area.
As for the swelling which sometimes accompanies certain limbs, it may be due to fat, bone, or swelling. Some of it is due to the root of some joints of the fingers
Or it may be due to some swelling in the joints of the fingers which is fixed and cannot be moved, and which is at the root of the joints of the fingers, perhaps it is due to fat which has become too great in that place.
And as for the swelling which is at the root of the joint, its treatment is to cut away the excess tissue and uncover the bone, and to spread the bone outwards in the appropriate place
Then the wound will be closed, and as for the swelling which appears on the fingers from time to time, it is due to the accumulation of pus which is discharged from the wound, and which is what causes man to feel pain and discomfort, and which is like the result of a burn or a wound. In this case it is necessary to make an incision in the swelling to drain the pus.
Until the fingers regain their natural shape, and then you place between them a layer of fat or silk thread soaked in oil, in order that they do not adhere to each other or become infected, or that you place between them a thin sheet of lead until the wound has healed
And in like manner if the swelling of the finger-tips becomes visible on the palm of the hand, make an incision in the swelling according to its condition and shape the limb to its natural position.
Chapter Nine.
In the section on wounds.
Wounds are blood vessels that have become torn, filled with blood and having black spots. They are most common in the limbs and especially in the veins of the forearm, the calves and the buttocks, so it is necessary to immediately apply pressure from a black dressing and maintain strong pressure for a while.
Then remove the owner of the wound and as for treatment, there are two methods: one is to cut and let out the black blood, and the other is to apply pressure with a bandage and let out the fluid with pressure. As for cutting, do this only if the limb is immersed in hot water, otherwise do not do it
until the thick blood has clotted and then tighten the limb from above the knee to the ankle with a bandage and cut the vein in one place or two or three wide incisions.
Then drain the black blood from the limb from below the ankle to above and from above to below until it comes out from the wound enough or until the limb is strong and the pressure is released.
When the veins are full and this causes pain in the limb, and as for the wound it is like this if there is much hair in the limb then put in the bath and pull out the limb with hot water until it softens and discharge the urine or do physical exercise vigorously.
If it has not been bathed until the limb is hot, then cut the skin opposite the vein with a knife either above the knee or below the ankle and open the skin with stitches and drain the urine from all sides until feeling sensation returns
When the tip of the instrument is inserted, one will see the vein turn red. When it emerges from the skin, one will also see that it resembles a cord. The vein then enters downwards until it reaches the level where it rises and emerges from the skin, leaving behind a hollow, smooth cavity. Then one makes another incision beside that one, leaving space for three fingers.
The skin is then loosened from the neck until it is visible. The vein is then lifted up as before and the surrounding area is sutured as before. Another incision is then made beside the previous one, or several incisions if necessary.</start_of_turn>
The vein is then severed at the end of the incision at the elbow. It is then ligated and cut out until it emerges from the second incision. It is then ligated to the incision above it and this is repeated until it is ligated from the highest incision of all.</start_of_turn>
If there is no need for further ligation, a strong needle is inserted with strong thread and the vessel is ligated and cut out. A probe is then introduced downwards and the surrounding tissue is grasped with the hand until it emerges and is preserved without cutting through. If cutting does occur, it will delay the process of ligation.</start_of_turn>
A sponge moistened with water is placed over the surgical area. If the bleeding is copious, pressure is applied to the wound with a wad of cotton wool, lard, alum or oil until the bleeding stops. If the bleeding is severe and persistent, it is necessary to rotate the affected area.</start_of_turn>
If the bleeding is not controlled as we have mentioned, a further incision must be made at every area of congestion and the surrounding tissues must be rotated. The area is then sutured with sutures until the bleeding stops. Care must be taken during the incision to avoid cutting the vein or causing further bleeding, as this will delay the process of ligation.</start_of_turn>
The wound which has been caused by a fracture.
The compound fracture
It does not have a complete fracture as the other bones, and the extremity is not fractured to the point of causing the breaking of the blood vessels. It is rather that it is slightly fractured, so that the blood vessels are not completely severed, but are rather pressed together by the swelling.
The severe fracture and swelling.
Within the marrow of the bone there are blood vessels
This blood arises in the leg in the hot regions such as Baghdad and Syria, and in the regions of the sparse and dry scrub vegetation, and perhaps in other parts of the body except the legs, and is caused by an infection occurring under the skin
It also occurs in living bodies, in abscesses and boils, and in the swelling between the skin and the flesh. The sign that this infection has occurred is that it begins in the lower part of the leg, then spreads to the surrounding area, and finally the blood vessels burst from that area of infection
Like a plant or an animal. If one side of it appears, it must be bound up with a small piece of lead that is equal in weight to two drams and that is fixed and left in place.
Whatever comes out of it must be bound up with lead and held in place. If you leave it for a long time, some of it will break away and you will wrap the rest without cutting through its root before all of it comes out, for if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing blood and pus to form in the place and a bad wound
Therefore it is necessary to drain it cautiously until it comes out completely, and there should be nothing left of it in the body. It sometimes comes out of some people measuring five or six inches in length
If a man has sustained an injury from ten wounds, and you are treating him while an antidote is being prepared, insert a probe into the wound and fill the cavity with a long tube containing the antidote until all the material and medication has been expelled.
Then deal with the tumors, for they may be numerous. This is especially true if they appear in the hip or in the chest, causing many ulcers and discharging from every orifice like effective medicine as we mentioned earlier.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 2 - Expansion.</start_of_turn>
The section title is: "On the Incision of the Gangrene That Lies Under the Ribs and Is Called the Bull's Disease.
This disease is called the bull's disease in some countries because it often occurs in bulls and is a small worm that lies between the skin and the flesh and spreads throughout the body, causing swelling and pain.</start_of_turn>
Its sign appears from organ to organ until it breaks out where it does not go out in the skin at a place and comes out and causes swelling in the abdomen, infection of the spleen and kidneys, and vomiting blood.</start_of_turn
And indeed, when it spreads in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it often opens in it and comes out, causing blindness. Many times when we attempt to treat it and expel it, the eye is opened and the sight is lost, and this is often seen.</start_of_turn
Therefore, bind what is above and below firmly and securely, then make an incision and expel it. If it has penetrated the flesh and you do not find it, carry on the procedure until you burn it, for the greatest thing is to avoid its damage to the eye as we mentioned earlier.</start_of_turn
If the head of the patient has become swollen near the eye, make an incision under the eyebrow, slightly beyond the bridge of the nose. Then open the wound and remove the foreign body. The physician should then instill soothing medications to cleanse the body, facilitate the elimination of bile, and preserve the appetite.
The Third Chapter: Swelling and Incision.
On the swelling known as the nafer
The swelling known as the nafer in our land is one that appears in some organs and then spreads to others. I have seen it on...
I saw a woman who was ill in some parts of her body. She had a swelling in her arm and I put a compress on it. The swelling grew and went up to her armpit with great speed, like the buzzing of bees going up to her armpits.
When it comes from one place to another, the pain is left from that place and settles in the armpits. I sat for an hour and saw that it had spread throughout the whole body, even reaching the other arm. Then she told me that it had been rotating all over her body like this
I was amazed at the speed with which it spread from one organ to another, and I had never seen anything like it before. But in this woman's case...
I do not know except that perhaps the woman was from the countryside and was used to being exposed to the elements, so that is why the feeling of the wind is transmitted and appears like this in people who are affluent and well-off who are accustomed to covering their bodies
If you wish to treat her and her pain is severe, appear with the wound open above and under the eye, and cut until the wind comes out.
If the eye is not moist with active blinking, the hum of the body will not be expelled and the wind will not be driven off. Love for mint and cinnamon and similar medicines will drive it out like a strong breeze.
The interval between blinks and the dilation of the pupil.
In the discharge of the arrow
The arrow may differ according to its kind and the place where it is located in the body. As for the difference between them, there are those that are large and small, those that are spherical and those that are quadrilateral and those that have three angles and four angles
Some of them have tongues and some of them have barbs. As for those that are located in the organs, they are on two surfaces. But as for the organs that are major and joined together like the brain and the heart and the liver and the lung and the kidney and the spleen and the marrow, etc When an arrow falls into one of these organs and you see the signs of death which I describe to you afterwards, then you must avoid extracting that arrow from it. For death will follow the owner of that arrow in most cases When the arrow does not appear to have penetrated the organ and there is no bone fracture or opening of the abdominal cavity, which is on the brain, and if there is bleeding from the brain, it will cause severe headache, vomiting and dizziness.
When the arrow does not appear to have penetrated the organ and there is no bone fracture or opening of the abdominal cavity, which is on the brain, and if there is bleeding from the brain, it will cause severe headache, vomiting and dizziness. And in the eyes and the tongue and the cheek and the brain and the ear, and there may be bleeding from the nose or the ears or cutting of speech and loss of voice and coming out from the wound a white frothing resembling bile that proceeds like vomit.
If these signs appear, then grasp the treatment of the lesser and do not extract the arrow if it has not already been extracted. And as for the sign of the arrow if it is close to the left rib and you feel something as if it has been embedded in something solid not in something empty.
If the wound resembles the pulse in its movement and blood flows steadily from the wound, black as night, and is followed by swelling of the limb and cold sweat, know that death is inevitable. If blood like olive oil escapes from the wound when the lung is injured, this is a sign of a serious wound.
The veins near the neck dilate, the face turns pale, and breathing becomes rapid and shallow. The patient should be given cold air. If the wound is close to the ribs and breathing becomes labored with a severe cough, this is an indication of a serious wound
All abdominal and chest organs become rigid, and if the liver wound follows this with severe pain and blood resembling the liver in color escapes from the wound, or if the stomach is injured and blood appears from the food, this is not normal.
The patient becomes pale and sweaty, and blood escapes from the wound along with feces, bile or urine. This is not normal in any case, regardless of the wound's location or the nature of the arrow
The patient is pale and sweating profusely, and blood escapes from the wound alongside feces, bile or urine. This is a sign of imminent death. All organs, including the face, eyes, throat, chest, shoulder, back, thigh and leg, are in danger.
When the arrow does not strike a vein or nerve, and is not venomous, and I tell you some of the things I have seen with such arrows to guide your treatment. Indeed, the majority of people who have been struck by arrows in the chest have died at their origin
I have extracted it from the other side under the earlobe and it was healed without any deformity, and another arrow was extracted from under the lower eyelid without causing any harm, and the tip of the arrow that remained stuck had only grazed the bone.
Three large arrows were discharged from the central pocket of the iron helmet, without any deviation. The Jew did not suffer any injury, and no harm befell his eye. Another arrow was extracted from the nape of the neck, the projectile being of Arab origin.

The swelling persists despite repeated applications of the bandage. No accident has occurred during this time. The wound remains closed and the cause of the swelling has not been eliminated until today.
Until it opened and was cleansed, the wound continued to swell. Then the slight wound sustained by the arrow remained open. The medication was applied to the wound, but the swelling did not subside until it became apparent that the arrow remained lodged in the cavity.
Then, when the wound expanded and allowed access to the cavity, the arrow was grasped and extracted. It did not respond to expulsion until it was grasped with instruments until it was finally grasped one day with all its might.
The physicians were in agreement that the bone of the nose must not be fractured, and that the closing of the wound and healing of the cause of the swelling would be sufficient to restore complete health without causing any discomfort. I tell you this because I recall having extracted some arrows as an example of this.</start_of_turn>
Because the parts of this craft are not known in detail in the description and are not covered in the book, and because the experienced craftsman makes an estimate of little and great things, and what is omitted and what is added are new techniques and tools at the hands of skilled physicians.</start_of_turn>
If one departs from this craft, I say that the arrows emerge from two places: either by their attraction from the place where they entered or by their resistance against the other side, and they emerge from the place where they entered.</start_of_turn>
If an arrow has penetrated a fleshy part and is unable to be extracted immediately, it is permissible to leave it in place until the surrounding tissue becomes softened, facilitating its removal.
If it is not possible to extract the arrow immediately, it is permissible to leave it in place until the surrounding tissue softens. In the meantime, the area should be kept clean and bandaged, and the patient should be advised to move around. If the arrow does not eventually come out on its own, it will be necessary to perform a thorough exploration of the wound and remove the arrow using appropriate instruments.
If the arrow has penetrated a bony structure and caused damage to a brain cavity, and symptoms have appeared indicating such, the arrow should be left in place until healing has occurred.
It is permissible to leave the arrow in place if it has not caused significant bleeding or other symptoms. A bandage should be applied around the arrow and the area should be treated until healing occurs If the patient is unconscious and the wound is narrow, the arrow can be grasped with forceps, and if the wound is wide or there is suspicion of fracture, bone or nerve damage, or excessive bleeding, the arrow should not be removed
The surrounding tissue must be softened before attempting to extract the arrow. If there are fatty deposits around the wound, these must be displaced before attempting to grasp the arrow
If you attempt to extract an arrow from any location, grasp the hand with all your fingers until you have stabilized it and reached the tip of the arrow. If you do not do this, the arrow may break, making it difficult to remove. If you are unable to do this within a reasonable amount of time.
Wait until the surrounding tissues have become taut, then attempt to remove the arrow. It is easier at this point. If bleeding persists, use the treatment mentioned in the previous chapter. Conserve your strength by avoiding the cutting of nerves, veins or arteries, and use any available techniques.
Use all your strength to grasp the arrow and remove it without causing additional damage. This should be done quickly and carefully, as described previously. When grasping the arrow, maintain the same position as when the arrow was originally lodged
If you are unable to do this, use any available methods. If the arrow has exited the body through another part, or if there is something protruding from the skin near the tip of the arrow, grasp the arrow as close to the tip as possible and remove it whole.
Grasp the hand firmly with all your fingers and rotate it until the arrow exits the bone without causing further damage.
Do not leave the arrow in place any longer than necessary. If the arrow has penetrated the bone, grasp the shaft and pull until it exits. If the shaft has fractured, insert an instrument through the wound and grasp the tip of the arrow to pull it out
If the arrow is embedded, grasp it with an instrument that will pass through the wound. If the arrow is poisonous, remove as much of the surrounding tissue as possible, if possible, and then apply the appropriate treatment
If the arrow is in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis or in the groin and is close to something that might cause damage to the surrounding structures, you can dissect around it and remove the arrow without harming the surrounding parts.
Then make an incision if necessary and suture it when finished, so as to prevent any swelling or bleeding around the wound site.</start_of_turn>
The extremities of the wound will be like a bird's feathers, which have grasped the arrow or something else that has not been left behind. This will make large, medium, and small types of wound depending on the size of the arrow, the size of the wound and the width and depth of the wound.</start_of_turn

This is the end of the arrow, like the stopper, which does not allow it to penetrate the wound.</start_of_turn
The fifth part is the expansion.</start_of_turn
In the division of blood vessels.</start_of_turn
The blood vessels which are usually divided in the body are three: two veins from the head, sixteen veins from the neck, and the two carotid arteries and the two popliteal veins in the groin.</start_of_turn
And the artery that runs in the middle of the forehead, the artery which is at the tip of the nose and the veins which are in the neck, the veins which are in the upper jaw of the mouth and the veins which are in the lower jaw, these veins are known as the frontal, jugular and lingual veins.</start_of_turn
As for the veins that arise in the arm and hand, there are five of them. One of them is the cephalic vein, which is on the lateral side and is named the general vein of the head and neck. Another is the median vein, which is composed of the brachial and cephalic veins and is named the general vein of the body.
The brachial vein is on the inner side and is also called the axillary vein and is named the general vein of the abdomen and the arm, and the radial vein is on the elbow and joins it.
There are two veins in the forearm, and three in the leg. One of the leg veins is below the knee on the lateral side, another is the popliteal vein which is at the knee on the inner side, and the saphenous vein which is at the ankle on the lateral side.
There are three veins in the other leg like those behind the ears. As for the veins that arise from the temples, they are useful for long-term conditions such as the spleen and the thyroid, and their condition is similar to that of the head and neck veins
The head of the ulna rests on the olecranon process of the humerus and the elbow crease is located below the head of the ulna. The elbow crease is about two finger-widths below the level of the head of the ulna.
Then she takes a pinch of fat which is known as the scalenus and inserts it under the vein in the skin until it reaches the bone. Then she raises the arm with the vein and the skin above and cuts the vein with the skin together. The length of the incision is as long as two fingers lying side by side
The blood supply to the parts that you wish to dissect should be closed off. Then, the incisions should be made and the tissues should be separated until the vessels are detached. This matter has been discussed previously in other books, and I have explained it in detail there. As for the two vessels that are in the flanks, they are of great benefit in cases of prolonged sitting, severe abdominal pain, permanent swelling, and severe head injury affecting the eyes.
Their importance in these matters is such that if you grasp them by the root and pull them up to the navel, their sweat will appear as foam over the surface and their pulse will be perceptible under your fingers. When you learn this with the needle and lift the skin from above the sweat to below your fingers, you will perform the operation successfully.
The needle enters from below and comes out at the top, drawing out the sweat along with it, just as it is done with the other incisions. The blood supply to the desired area is closed off, and the vein is ligated at the root, while the thumb is placed on the sweat gland for an hour.
Then a bandage is placed over it, pressure is applied and the tension is increased, and it is left until it heals. This matter has been discussed previously in other books, and I have mentioned it in detail there. As for the vessels of the forehead, their benefit is especially great in cases of facial swelling caused by prolonged sitting, severe headaches, and tumors.
Their importance in these matters is such that if you grasp them by the root and pull them up to the navel, their sweat will appear. Take the instrument that is called the forceps and this is its form...
You place the hook of the forceps on the same sweat gland and grasp it with a clamp or something else in this way, and you leave the blood supply to the area that you desire. Then you ligature the vein at the root and tighten it until it heals
If the bone is close to the limb, the incision should be small and precise, since the bone is near and any excessive incision will fracture it.

When the nose and its surroundings are congested, and the palate is such that it rests low before you and tightens the back of the tongue, then turn your tongue to the right and left and observe the two pharyngeal secretions which you see: one is on the right side of the epiglottis and the other on the left.
And also when the congestion is about them, there are dark blood vessels around them which cut them into pieces; if you do not know what to do and leave them whole, they will swell up in the pharyngeal secretions beneath the tongue.
And as for the two pharyngeal secretions under the tongue, they are of use after the palate has been split from the tonsils which are in the throat from the disease of the tonsils and the diseases of the mouth, and the way of their use is that they should rest low between your hands like the shade of the sun and lift up the tongue and look under the tongue from one side a secretion and from the other side a secretion, and their color is black.
And they should be split and preserved without meaning in their pieces, for there are three veins which are usually split in people and their splitting is on both sides
Or by a blunt hook curved upwards or by a lancet and this is its method [its image].
The vein is wide as you see to reach the congested veins filled with prominent clots which contain thick blood like drops of rain, and this is the method of the olive hook
This is the method of the needle which is less wide and has a finer tip to reach the congested veins which contain yellow bilirubin-stained blood, and this is the method of the lancet
The swelling that accompanies fracture is of various kinds according to the size of the vessels and their narrowing or widening.
The swelling associated with fracture is of various types depending on the size of the blood vessels and their narrowing or widening
The swelling resulting from bleeding is of various types depending on the size of the blood vessels and their narrowing or widening. In the event of severe bleeding, the vessel should be tightly ligated rather than loosely sutured. If the swelling does not visibly diminish after ligation, it is necessary to repeat the procedure or request additional assistance
Or if the limb is fractured and bleeding profusely, the vessel should be firmly ligated rather than loosely sutured. If the swelling still persists after ligation, it is necessary to repeat the procedure or request additional assistance in locating the source of bleeding.
Then tightly ligate the limb and make a wide incision around the swelling as we mentioned previously. Ensure the fracture is distal to the vessel. If you see swelling when tightening the ligation, this indicates that the vessel has been injured.
If you see blood during the incision or when tightening the ligature, and the blood is dark red and thick, then know that it is blood from the artery. In this case, tighten the ligature cautiously and leave the finger on for an hour before removing it. If bleeding persists, do not remove the finger immediately.
Leave it like that and do not move the limb. Do not move it at all until the bleeding stops. If bleeding does not cease and pain persists without relief, then cut the vessel if necessary, as its two ends will contract and the bleeding will stop
If you take a quarter of a clove of garlic, pierce it and split it in half, and apply half of it to the waist, secured with a bandage and a cloth, until tomorrow, it will stop bleeding and make ineffective whatever causes bleeding from fractured bones. Cutting off the blood supply is not difficult in most cases.
The wound is small and the bandage can be applied to the arm without difficulty, but as for the abdomen, it is large and its contents can attract blood from the head downwards to the belly, as it is composed of parts of the intestines and parts of the liver as we have mentioned
It is necessary to apply the dressing to the neck from the flank, and if you lift the intestines slightly and tighten the dressing more tightly, and if the vein is not obstructed, there will be a sensation of relief in the head and the pain will probably disappear altogether. This vein is often the cause of pain.
If it is hidden in some people and appears pale, it is necessary to make the wound wide with an incision and avoid the vein. If the abdomen is between two veins, the wound should be made wide, and as for the ileal vein, it is useful for its ability to attract blood from the head.
It is useful for eye diseases and it is particularly useful for this vein; if you wish to ligate it, you should do so with fine sutures or broad sutures of silk or linen, as these will not damage any vessels or nerves.
It is necessary to avoid only the root of the vein and ask for the position again, as it does not harm if it is not struck in the first strike; perhaps it will become evident in subsequent strikes.
However, this swelling does not harm him in any way. As for the method of incision and its consequences, and what should be advanced in its repair, the first thing that should be learned is that incision is to be used only for the preservation of health.
...or for the treatment of diseases which are used for the preservation of health and maintenance of well-being, and for the prophylaxis of the occurrence of diseases, incision should be employed in one of the three veins which are in the groin, the armpit and the elbow, and should be made at the earliest sign of congestion.
Incision should be performed on either the first or third day after the swelling has persisted for three hours. As for the incision used in treating diseases, it has no fixed time limit, but should be performed when necessity or the urgency demands it, day or night
At every hour and at every time, incision should not be performed on children until they are fourteen years old, nor on adults who have passed the age of sixty. If anyone forces anyone to undergo incision for any reason, it is unlawful
The belly should be emptied beforehand by an enema if there is much thick mucus in it, lest it be drawn into the veins during incision and cause infection of the vital organs. Incision should not be performed on the constipated or diabetic or the paralytic until the cause of their condition has disappeared
Incision should also be avoided after menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and excessive vomiting, diarrhea, fever, fatigue, travel, sexual intercourse, sleeplessness, and fasting of all that which weakens the body or mind, and then look at the color of the blood if it is thick.
If possible, let food and drink be taken, and then take a warm bath if this does not conflict with any prohibition, and perform some mild exercise to make the blood flow more rapid and facilitate the healing of the incision on the following day, as we have mentioned, and let the patient rest from all physical and mental anxieties.
Pain and fear affect all physical organs, including the limbs, chest, and abdomen. Many things which people have become accustomed to using, such as perfumes, unguents, and medications, can cause these feelings.
Then the surgeon sits on a cushion which is higher than the cushion on which the patient sits. He then raises the arm and grasps it with his hand several times or thrice. He then tightens the ligature with the forceps and relaxes it several times or thrice, but not too tightly
For if the tension is too great, it may obstruct the blood supply, or if it is too loose, the bleeding will not be stopped. After tightening the ligature, the surgeon should then move his hand over the entire circumference of the limb several times
until the vessels dilate and the sensation returns. Then the surgeon should apply a little pressure with his thumb from the left hand on the same vessel under the point where he wishes to ligate it somewhat so as not to obstruct the blood. Because some veins are tense and will obstruct if ligated, while others are filled with air and will collapse under pressure. So when you apply pressure to them, the vein collapses and the surgeon does not open the vein, and if he does open it, the opening will be narrow.
Thus the surgeon must be careful and attentive to all these matters. Then he should withdraw his hand and if he has opened the vein, he should do so once more under that point or slightly above or below it urgently if he did not obstruct it the first time
because if the swelling or split is great, leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the ligature. For it may bring about a hot wound and will not enter the wound. Then repeat the ligation if you wish, but if the pressure was previously applied too tightly and the bleeding was considerable.
Blood should not be allowed to escape from the wound. I therefore put a plug of material into the opening and press it firmly to ensure it is secure. This must be done urgently, for if the material is delayed, the surrounding tissue will swell and become inflamed. In many people, delay in closing the wound will cause swelling.
If the wound has swollen, it is of no use to add butter. Rather, olive oil should be applied, as it makes blood flow easier. This is better in this situation than butter or any other ointment.</start_of_turn>
Olive oil should be used for all wounds and ulcers when blood flow is difficult. This can be achieved using sponges or strips of silk, which should be applied to the wound. If any of these are placed on the wound, the blood will flow smoothly and the swelling will subside.</start_of_turn>
If there is swelling in a wound and a large swelling appears, do not be afraid. This is especially important if the wound has not been opened or if the opening is small. In such a case, put a wetted sponge over the swelling and press it firmly for an hour. The swelling will subside.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary to do this after the blood has drained from the wound, with its discharge or pus. If it remains in the wound after days, something black or green is harmful. If you like, wait a while before closing the wound.</start_of_turn>
Or something of barley gruel and the like. Often there is swelling and pus at the incision of the bladder. I put my hand over it and if I find it soft when I press on it, that is pus. This is harmful. Be cautious not to put anything on it as we have mentioned.</start_of_turn>
Perhaps some blood vessels have bled. But I bind up the wound and leave it alone until treatment is complete. It is necessary for everyone to bleed to their full capacity and for the colour of the blood to change.
If the blood is black, let it be evacuated until it becomes pale. If the tumor is firm, send it until it ruptures. If it is hard, evacuate until its limit is reached. It is desirable for one who is strong and in need of evacuation to do so promptly.
Expand the evacuation and make it gentle for one who is weak. If he is frail, resist this. Evacuation should be performed in stages and the opening should be small. The best instrument for evacuation is a sharp, curved lancet rather than a needle
This blow of evacuation is safe from bleeding and from cutting nerves. It is Ahmad and is safe from evacuation by exposure and length. If he is accustomed to it during evacuation of the tumor, let him be given something of bread from the date-stone or dates before evacuation
If he is bruised and blood is evacuated three or four times, or if his temperament is cold, let him be given before evacuation some dates from the date-stone or honey or in strong wine or in strong vinegar.
If there is bleeding during evacuation and a great amount of blood has escaped, let him be given broth and faint drink of vinegar and strong medicine. Use all the means mentioned in the section on tumors.
Whoever is suffering from pain and wants to relieve his limbs and rest his blood a second time, let him who has evacuated his tumor be given much to drink and his strength be weak that his blood be evacuated little by little as much as his strength allows in any successive days.
Whoever wants to relieve his limbs and rest his blood a second time and whose body is strong, let him do so within seven or eight hours of his first evacuation. As for him who wants to withdraw blood from his body against the area that has protruded, let him do so on the second or third day.
If there is much blood in the body, it has spoken and become agitated, causing fever. It must be expelled from the body in a single spurt and a great amount must be expelled, widening the opening until the tissue is fully exposed after all the conditions for excision have been met. And place your hand on his pulse when bleeding to prevent death in the area of the incision. Much blood may be exposed if the surgeon is unskilled and neglectful, and it is not permissible to leave it exposed if you wish to solve the arm and rest the blood a second time.
The mouth of the vein and the passage of blood must be tightly closed with great force, or be ligated with great strength, for otherwise the bleeding will not cease. It is either that the vein is ligated a second time or that the clot is removed from the mouth of the vein.
Or place over it something of salt which has been dissolved in water or something of farcicles of alum and soak it in vinegar, and press it firmly until the blood stops flowing. If the vein has swelled up, leave it alone
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides, for if necessity compels you to rest the blood a second time, it is not permissible to do so except by removing it from above or from the arm or the vein on the other side
And if you must ligature the arm, do so in place of the artery and vein if they are not evident or hidden because they are composed of both, and the way to ligate them is to insert the needle into the water of the blood until the mark of the bone appears, then pull the thread tightly over it with a little slack.
Then expel the vein over slight elevation without revealing or stretching the skin and with a wide opening, and if blood does not issue, repeat the procedure with the hand in the basin of hot water, allowing the blood to flow in the water
Until your need is met, if you are in any days of summer, you may abstain from washing your hands in hot water and more than that which makes the blood flow in hot water in winter, and the sweating of this will protect you from all the other sweats. Since there is no bad sweat or nerve, and as for the sweating of the right hand, it is useful from the bile and the way it is excreted, so it will bind the wrist of the hand with the binding or with your hand after you have dipped it in the hot water until the sweat has bubbled up.

If you perforate the vein with the needle it will contract like one that is being cut and will become limp and swollen. If blood does not flow out, leave the needle in the water and allow the blood to flow through it until it empties. If you make a mistake with the needle in the vein on the first attempt.
If you withdraw the needle a little further, if the tissue is sound it will not cause it harm. If you preserve the nerve as we have mentioned, and do the same with the vein of the other side, as for the vein of the woman, its place is as we have mentioned behind the bone on the lateral side.
Its advantage is that if the pelvis was previously filled with blood, it is sufficient for the vein to enter the pelvis, speed up and tighten the limb from the knee down to the ankle with four fingers in a long sweep, and it does not show except for that
And if you see the swelling on any case, whether you perforate it or cut it open, if its place is sound, it is better to leave it alone or cut it through a slit, for its place is hidden in most people except in some cases.
And the sensation of the limb does not appear when you perforate some of them, such as those that appear on the back of the foot towards the heel and protect the nerves and send blood in the quantity that you want.
Then the tension of the limb is released at the place of the perforation and the place is tightened up quickly, and it is quick to recover
The sixth division and expansion.
In the abdomen and its manner of use
The intestines may be of horn or wood or bone or glass, and the abdomen is on two faces, one for the introduction of blood and the other for the discharge of blood.
These wounds are without exception to be dressed on both sides.
The instruments used in this condition and the blood that comes out of them are in fourteen places in the body: the nape of the neck from both sides, the jaw below the lower lip, the armpits, the bones of the forearm on both sides, the hands, the thighs, the calves, the armpits, and the genitals
The wound draws blood from superficial and deep veins in the muscle, so do not tighten the dressing too tightly to prevent bruising or excessive pressure. It should not be used with fire in any disease until the whole body is evacuated of its contents.
If the need for surgery arises from a disease or by custom, we use it at all times in the first month and in the last month and in the middle and at any time.
So some people have too much blood in their body that it requires evacuation, and the surgery causes them to have a headache and dizziness. Others have swelling and inflammation in their face and head and back and chest and calves. Some have bites on their face and nose and swelling in their eyes and some have pain in the area of their wounds and genitals
Some have too much urine in their body that it requires evacuation. Others have a bitter taste in their mouth and swellings under their tongue, and vomit blood. Others have excessive sleep and sleepiness, and see blood and pus in their urine and swelling and bruising
Specifically, if in the middle third of the month menstruation persists for two or three days, cupping is appropriate. As for the benefit of cupping, it alleviates the weight of the head and water that accumulates in the eyes.
However, it is important to perform this after emptying the body of its discharge. This cupping may be an alternative to cautery and caution should be exercised if used by those with cold brains or a hernia, as it may harm them greatly
It is also inappropriate to perform it by those with cold fevers or amnesia.
The cuppers should be commanded to keep their hands slightly below the navel in order to prevent the possibility of fainting, and cupping of the head is better than cautery or the incision of the belly and the flanks
It is beneficial for hiccups, mental distress, headaches, and vomiting, and it is better to raise the cupping slightly rather than to lower it too much, as this may weaken the heart and stomach
As for cupping of the veins, it is beneficial for the severe headaches, swelling of the limbs and abdomen, toothaches, and it is an alternative to cautery of the intestines, and the cuppers should be commanded not to deepen their hands excessively lest they sever a vein and cause bleeding
It is beneficial for the spasms in the jaw and the loosening of the teeth, for the swelling of the gums and the lips, and may take the place of excision of the tonsils which are in the cheeks, and the cupping of the shoulders is beneficial for hiccups which are caused by heat and swelling.
It is beneficial for what is beneficial in excision of the three veins of the belly and the intestines, because it draws blood from all of these superficial veins and from deeper veins up to the three large veins.
Surgeons should be commanded to desist from surgery in cases where the location is known to be fatty tissue and nerves and blood vessels are present, as well as when the sole remaining organ is the one that is being operated on.
Surgeons should be commanded to perform a large incision and use broad-based instruments, as the location requires great force and there is a great likelihood of fracture of the glass vessel and many conditions of the case. As for the leg vessels, their emptying is deficient in us today due to our scarcity of means.</start_of_turn>
The location attracts blood from all over the body and is useful for chronic pain in the kidneys, intestines and bladder, and it also benefits from swelling and congestion, and it is a substitute for cauterization of scars and styptic pencils, except that it causes great damage to the body and there is often bleeding in most people, and the incisions of the armpits are of little benefit compared to the incisions of the leg veins.</start_of_turn>
The manner of handling the incision is that you should first make an empty incision and then gradually fill it with a substance appropriate to the situation but do not prolong the period of incision but rather put it quickly and remove it quickly so that blood can fill the place immediately and continuously without leaving any space empty. Repeat this until the location turns red and opens.</start_of_turn>
The blood appears pale and stiff when it is fresh, but as time passes, it becomes dark red and soft. As for people, if anyone has fatty tissue mixed with bones in their body, it is sufficient to make one incision without causing any harm.
Surgeons should be commanded to expand the incision slightly and deepen it a little, and to perform this while gently moving the soft tissues. If there is thick blood, it should be evacuated twice. If it is done once, the blood vessel will open, and if it is done twice, the thick blood will be evacuated.</start_of_turn
If blood is very dense and viscous, a single restriction is sufficient to achieve the desired effect. However, if a large amount of blood needs to be evacuated, multiple restrictions are necessary.
The restrictions must be placed deeply and moderately in the depth of the skin only, and should not be applied from the fats or from liquids or anything that hinders the flow. As for thick, tough, fibrous and solidified blood, do not attempt to restrict it with tight ligatures.</start_of_turn>
The wounds should be dressed with loose-fitting fat-soaked materials, such as butter, beeswax, almond oil, or olive oil from the dates.</start_of_turn>
And if it is winter, like beeswax from the honeycomb, poppy seeds, rue, or chamomile, or if the wound is hot, like butter from dates, mustard seed, or olive oil from the olives.</start_of_turn>
If the tissue is wide and there is abundant fat, do not tighten the ligatures too much. Wash the wound with water of rose, cold water, or water of fennel, pomegranate, or chamomile.</start_of_turn>
Wash the wound with vinegar or rose water, fennel or chamomile. As for thick blood, wash the wound with strong wine or mustard seed or alum or chamomile.</start_of_turn>
And do not use anything for an hour or two after the procedure. No one should sleep after the procedure. Do not leave the restrictions in place before or after the procedure.</start_of_turn>
If the abdomen is swollen or distended with bile and its contents are limited and inflamed, it is necessary to take refrigerants such as alum and rhubarb, and to apply external poultices of chamomile, rue, and prickly pear. One should also give soft foods such as barley, fish, and eggs, and bland foods like broth and barley.
If the patient is cold, one should administer honey and vinegar or the lukewarm broth of rue and barley. It is recommended to take fragrant broth that is between the old and the new. This will stimulate the appetite, and make food more palatable, such as barley, barley sprouts, eggs, and broth.
In some cases, it may be necessary for some people to take ginger tea or musk before or after meals or during them to strengthen the major organs and improve blood circulation, and it is not permissible for the feverish to take it.
As for the remaining parts of the body that are not mentioned above, such as the liver, spleen, kidneys and bladder, their condition is not mentioned in this text, so I cannot provide any information regarding them
We apply it to the chest in cases of fainting or use it to expel an air bubble that may be causing pain in the organ. This cools the organ, softens it and helps to evacuate the air bubble.
It can be applied to the kidneys if there is a blockage or stone in them. This will soften the stone and help to evacuate it from its position. It can also be applied to the liver and spleen when there is pain due to wind in these organs. These poultices are usually used without any other medication
The burn may be treated with either dry or wet materials. In the case of superficial burns, wet materials such as sponges or cloths may be used to fill the cavity and expand with hot water alone or with water in which some herbs have been boiled.
Then a dressing is placed over the area and bound firmly, and it is repeated as needed. This is the method of dressing that is used with fire treatment.</start_of_turn>
The size of the opening should be two fingers wide and be at the depth of half a palm, and it should be at the side of the wound, with a small hole at the bottom that the needle makes from the Chinese or yellow brass needle and the twisted hair.</start_of_turn>
A flat dressing is placed over it so that it does not injure the organ when placed on it, and there is an intervening space of hair between it and the wick of the lamp. The wick is made of beeswax or iron, and it is placed under the lamp, and it is made large or small according to the illness.</start_of_turn>
The wick used is that of infants and boys, and not that of men or camels. As for how to apply this lamp dressing to the wound, it is that you make a small hole in the cotton or wool and put a little bit of ointment on it, and then put it on the middle of the supporting stick that is in the middle of the dressing.</start_of_turn>
The flame should ascend towards the bottom of the dressing so that it does not burn the body, and then it is placed on the wound and the fingers on the hole mentioned above until the dressing has reached its desired level.</start_of_turn>
Smoke comes out of that hole and the dressing softens on the surface, then the wick is advanced forward and it is repeated if necessary. As for the dressing that is used for superficial burns with water, there is no supporting stick or hole.</start_of_turn>
When used and filled with water, and placed only upon the organ, this is its form.
This is the best when it is large enough to hold much water.</start_of_turn>
Seventh part and expansion.</start_of_turn>
On the intestines.</start_of_turn>
The suspension is used in most cases in organs where it is not possible to place the dressing or because the organ is covered with fat like fingers and nose and the like.</start_of_turn
And its sufficiency is that it be cleansed from the impurities of the intestines, then left for a day or two in pure water until it is evacuated and nothing remains in its belly.</start_of_turn Then the body is emptied either by vomiting or enema and the organ is washed clean.</start_of_turn>
Until it turns red, then you place it. If it fills, it drops. If possible, wash the dressing with the dressing and water and it will soften and the blood will flow freely. This is a good sign that the suspension has been successful and the clot has come out with the water.</start_of_turn
And you place it from above until the bleeding stops. If there is much blood, sprinkle it with powdered alum or sponges or something like that until the bleeding stops or put it on the wound the amount of cotton wool that covers two fingers.</start_of_turn
And leave it until the wound is closed. If the bleeding stops, it is good. If it is necessary to reattach the organ, do not reattach the organ if another one can be used. If the organ must be reattached, wash the wound with warm blood.</start_of_turn
If a needle is inserted into a tissue until something protrudes from the blood vessel, and the needle is then withdrawn, if the patient feels any blood at the site, the bleeding must be controlled. If the bleeding persists, the patient should be given time to recover or be treated with salt or alum.
Chapter Three.
In Surgery.
This chapter deals with the treatment of fractures and dislocations of bones
You should know, O sons of knowledge, that this chapter contains much that is unfamiliar to most physicians and the common people; for it deals with matters which have not been mentioned in books or read in their entirety by anyone before
Knowledge of this kind has become rare in our land, although it has always been a science with us. I have learned what I could from the ancient books and from my own experience over many years
I have set out in this chapter all that I know on the subject And I have added to it many experiments which I have performed after studying the matter carefully and omitting nothing from what I have observed and reducing it to the utmost simplicity and explaining it in the clearest possible way, and illustrating it with numerous images of the instruments which are used in this science
For this is from the increase of explanation as I have done in the preceding chapters, and there is no power except with God the Almighty
First Chapter.
Here are various matters relating to fractures and dislocations of bones, which we will discuss in detail later on. We will begin by mentioning the general principles of treatment and the various methods used for reduction of fractures and dislocations of bones You must first understand it and grasp its reality that you and those who are keen to learn this noble profession.
And I say that whenever a fracture, dislocation, wound, or fall occurs, it is incumbent upon you to swiftly address it, ease it, or address all of them together.</start_of_turn> Provided that these factors do not impede you, such as weakness of the limb or any other factor that may be due to youth or old age, or the severity of the injury or the passage of time is great, or extreme cold or heat.</start_of_turn>
Then, as for food, limit it to cold pulses, poultry, and legumes, and abstain from alcohol, fatty foods, and rich foods that obstruct blood flow until the swelling subsides and evacuation of material from the wound site has occurred.</start_of_turn>
Thus, do not return to the cause of your affliction until the first pain has subsided. If the fractured bone is rotated, it is necessary to feed the lesion with abundant food such as barley, wheat, barley sprouts, lentils, and fish.</start_of_turn And milk, fish, boiled drinks, and the like of these will expedite the healing of the fracture. Know that a fractured bone that is subjected to excessive tension or bending will never heal properly.</start_of_turn
Their swelling will subside and their union will take place and whatever was fractured among the bones of young people will unite in the same way that the nature of the fracture will cause some of them to adhere to each other like glue.</start_of_turn
Some of them will endure until the utmost strength and firmness, as was originally the case, without anything hindering their actions.
Some of them will persist until the greatest strength and firmness, as was originally the case, without anything hindering their actions.

If the limb is small, use your hand alone. If it is large, use two cords or with the cord and the hand. But place the limb in a position parallel to its natural shape until the broken bone has healed. Then reattach the fragments in their proper places with every possible care and kindness.
Strive diligently that there be no movement of the limb while you work and that you cause neither pain nor harm. And apply all your skill and care to uniting the two bones with each other in the best way possible. At that time you must touch and handle them with your hand, and if you see anything out of place, correct it to the best of your ability.
Beware excessive force and violent grasp as many fools and ignorant people often do, causing harm rather than benefit, and wasting time in the limb as you have often witnessed from their actions
Then when composure is achieved and skillfulness is perfected, keep the limb quiet and still, and be cautious that it not be moved when awake, asleep, or during its movements, and that no swelling or pain should occur.
Thus, when you feel that the limb is settled and painless, transfer it to its original position, so that it is neither painful nor swollen, and that it becomes stable and straight once again
And if there is displacement of the fractured bone, that is what I have explained to you before. Know that bones of different sizes and shapes are susceptible to this.
It is necessary for the supporting bandage to be wide and strong because the large bone requires support from all around equally without causing any displacement
After you have finished your preparation and settled, carry the instruments that are appropriate for the case. After you have finished your preparation and settled, carry the instruments that are appropriate for the case. In cases where the fracture is close to a joint, begin by wrapping the bandage around the fracture itself three or four times as appropriate for the part and tighten the hand slightly on the bandage. Then take it up to the higher side of the fracture site.</start_of_turn>
Wrap the bandage less tightly around the fracture site and gradually loosen the tension of the bandage as you move away from the fracture site. Take enough tension so that something substantial remains on the correct place, and then take another bandage and wrap it around the fracture site also.</start_of_turn>
Wrap the bandage, then take the bandage to the lower side of the fracture. Note that your action in tightening the bandage and loosening it is as we mentioned in the first wrapping. Place between the layers of the fracture what is appropriate to stabilize the fracture.</start_of_turn>
If there are any angulations or not, do not make anything of it. Then wrap another bandage over it and make it even with the other bands that you have made. If there is no swelling or inflammation in the part, close the incisions with fine sutures if necessary.</start_of_turn
If there is swelling or inflammation, carry on it what will calm that swelling and go away from the swelling and tighten the surrounding tissue when needed. Keep the surrounding area from being too tight around the fractured area, but also keep the surrounding area from being too loose.</start_of_turn
When making from silk or flax or wool or leather or gut and so on, and to make it as little bulky as possible in this manner and that way.</start_of_turn
The incision which is made on the fracture itself should be as large as possible and as narrow as possible compared to the rest of the incisions. And the length of the incision is made according to what is appropriate for the fractured bone from its breadth and length.
The incisions are secured with another bandage according to the degree of tension of the first incision. Then it is connected from above with strong sutures as mentioned previously concerning the tension, that is, the tension on the fracture site is greater. And the more distant from the fracture, the less the tension.
The sutures must be of medium thickness and flexibility and must be of the special kind that is used for wounds because if the sutures are too thick or stiff like what is done by the ignorant people, they will cause the wound to open, which is a great mistake
For the tension is outside the normal range and the flexible sutures are also not suitable because they do not reach the desired tension. Neither should the space between the incision and the bone be less than a finger width
If the little finger is injured after the tensioning in the healthy places, this will cause difficulty or soft cotton wool under it until it does not cause him any harm. And as for if the bone is fractured with a wound and there is a break in the skin, we will mention it separately.
And know that not every fractured bone necessitates incisions from the first day. For if the bone is large, it is not appropriate to place sutures on it until after five or seven days or more, according to your concern about the formation of swelling
These are the qualities of the sponges that were previously used for fractures and dislocations, a general salve that is rough and causes more pain and is not suitable for children and women because it is harsh and painful on them.
When you take from the thick of the caked bile which adheres to the precise opening in the vicinity of the uterus during the displacement of the membrane, it will irritate it as if from something external without causing its displacement and will make the urine dark without any residue or turbidity.
The description of another drug which compels fracture, displacement and adhesion, taking from barley, flaxseed, garlic, onions, resin and alum from each ten dirhams and half from each five dirhams, and from the best of these two dirhams from the aromatic earth or gypsum. It is pounded and mixed with cold water or buttermilk if the patient's condition is severe. This drug is useful as it quickly unites fractured bones and is more effective for most people due to its gentleness.</start_of_turn>
The description of another drug which is also useful for fracture and adhesion, taking alum, barley and white mustard from each ten dirhams and half from each five dirhams, cumin six dirhams, aromatic earth or gypsum twenty dirhams. It is pounded finely and mixed with water or buttermilk, and is used.</start_of_turn>
The description of a drug for the joints and bones which is used to soften them and relieve pain, swelling and fracture, taking wool which is washed and boiled in oil and applied to the place. This drug does not have any power to unite.</start_of_turn>
However, it is useful in relieving swelling and pain especially, the description of another drug which unites fractured bones, taking the leaves of henna and the leaves of chaste tree and pounding them together and applying two handfuls of this to the fracture. The description of another drug which is short and is used for dislocation of the bones.</start_of_turn>
Analyze the entirety of the swelling, taking from the root of the vein and the artery and the nerves themselves with meticulous precision. If none of the parts are movable, anoint them with paint. If any of the parts are movable, anoint them with olive oil or water and use it.
The most effective treatment for swelling is to analyze it thoroughly from its origin. This includes taking measurements from the root of the vein and artery, nerves and bones with meticulous precision. If none of the structures are movable, paint them. If any of the structures are movable, anoint them with olive oil or water and use it.
The above section discusses the process of analyzing and treating swelling, recommending the use of paint, olive oil or water, depending on the temperature and mobility of the affected structures. Albucasis does not provide any instructions regarding the application of plaster to broken bones in this text.
The ointment mentioned earlier is neither thick nor thin, but rather intermediate between the two extremes. Galenus, however, describes applying an ointment to the broken bone at its fracture site, including substances with some heat, such as alum, salt and pitch, as mentioned previously.
The ointment mentioned is useful for weakening and soothing, taking camphor, mustard, human hair or bird feather, alum, salt and henna as ingredients. Apply as much as is necessary to achieve the desired effect without excessive application
Then if no relief is found, and there is no swelling or pain or movement of the fractured bone from its place, do not attempt to move it for a long time. If, however, any of these things occur, it is necessary to reduce the fracture immediately
Therefore, do not delay treatment any longer. Remove any impediment and apply a bandage liberally moistened with cold water. Soak the area until the pain subsides and the swelling diminishes. Then leave the limb at rest for an hour
The soft tissue of the swelling is to be covered with wool that has been moistened in olive oil or beeswax and kept on for a night until the swelling subsides and the organ is relaxed. Then it is to be removed and the area gently massaged until it returns to its natural state.
The swelling should be covered until it subsides. If you see that the swelling, inflammation, pain, and swelling have all vanished and all symptoms have disappeared, then you should repeat the procedure as you did before. Even if nothing remains in the organ that I mentioned previously.
Do not remove it until three or four or five or seven days have passed. Leave it on according to what you see of the condition of the organ, as I have mentioned previously, until it is necessary to break it and drain the pus.
It has also been found more effective to tie it more tightly than before and to provide a nourishing diet for what has been mentioned previously. If you see that the place of the fracture has dried up and become soft, know that the food has become obstructed from reaching it
When it is washed with cold water every time you remove it and do it every three days and slightly reduce the tightness, this action will reach the organ and cause it to heal quickly. As for what is caused by the ignorant from the people of force who break the bone of the organ once more.
For if it had been treated as it should have been from the beginning and had been treated well from the start, it would have been a great benefit and no one has ever seen anyone do it like that before It is not correct to do it like that.
Second part.
In the treatment of head injuries.
There are many kinds of head bone fractures and they take various forms, and their causes are diverse. Some fractures are caused by a sword blow, while others may cause the entire bone to break through to the membrane beneath the bone. ...as in wood
...and this kind is called 'cadaverous fracture' because some of the bone fragments remain attached to the surrounding tissue. There are two types of this fracture: a complete fracture, in which the fracture breaks right through the bone, and a compound fracture, in which the fracture breaks through the bone and also breaks the membrane beneath the bone.
Some fractures are caused by a blow from a stone or a fall onto a stone or in some other way. This kind of fracture may either break the membrane beneath the bone or break the bone itself
...and the wound of these fractures may also be either large or small. Some fractures are hidden inside the bone, in the hair line, and are called 'creases'.
...and this kind is called 'hairline fracture'. Some fractures occur due to a fall or a blow from a stone or something similar, and the fragment enters the bone cavity and causes displacement as the piece of bone projects inwards.
...and this is more common in the fractured bones of children. All these types of fractures will be discussed in their proper places, and we will mention the treatment of all of them in their place.
...and they are exposed by palpation and removal of the soft tissue from them. As for the hairline fracture, it is known that it exposes the bone and involves stripping and stitching. If the fracture is black, treatment should first address the underlying cause of the fracture
If you perceive any symptoms that clearly indicate fear, such as vomiting of bile, abdominal distension, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, swelling, and severe fever, vomiting of blood and yellowing of the whites of the eyes with their protrusion and redness - these symptoms do not warrant treatment or a slight elevation of the condition. In such cases, death is likely to occur in most instances.
If you see symptoms that do not indicate imminent danger and suspect safety, then delay treatment for a while. This is because if an injury has occurred at the outset and it was in winter, treatment should be delayed until the following spring.
Avoid removing bones for fourteen days in any case. If it is summer, expedite the process of bone removal before the seventh day, as otherwise the membrane under the bone will decay, leading to these symptoms that we have mentioned
If the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and is associated with swelling and bleeding, then it is necessary to amputate the fractured portion of the bone immediately, as you will be dealing with the fracture of the skull itself.
Expose the bone on whichever side you are able to and according to the shape of the fracture and what is hidden from the vertex. This is because bleeding or swelling may be revealed upon exposure of the bone, which necessitates evacuation of these conditions
The area should be packed with moistened sponges in broth, fat, resin, and the wound should be closed until swelling subsides and bleeding is controlled. Then take up the fractured bone and remove it. This is done from one side only of the work
Or that you amputate the bone with a fine cut of the skin, as in this image
Then use another incision after this first one, leaving only a little exposed
Diverse sections of the wound are also used, some being wider and others narrower. Some are extensive and others limited in extent.
The edges of the wound are supported during incision to prevent displacement of the tissue and subsequent damage, especially if the bone is strong and solid. In such cases, it is necessary to perforate around the bone before using the sutures which are known as non-absorbable sutures or interrupted sutures.</start_of_turn>
Since the suture does not pass beyond the level of the bone cortex, there is a characteristic indentation at the head of the bone resembling a cusp or small ring, which prevents the suture from slipping and passing through the thickness of the bone.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary to take multiple sutures of varying lengths to accommodate the thickness of the bone. Each suture should reach a length that allows the sharp end to pass through the thickness of the bone without compromising the integrity of the surrounding tissue.</start_of_turn Large, medium, and small sutures.</start_of_turn>
The incision around the fractured bone should be made with the needle passing through the tissue and the bone simultaneously until the bone is adequately penetrated. Then the needle is transferred to another site and the procedure is repeated, ensuring that there is tissue between each suture and the bone.</start_of_turn
The sutures between each two punctures are then cut and the tissue is retracted as much as possible, as mentioned earlier, until the bone is adequately stabilized, either by hand or with the aid of instruments.</start_of_turn
Like fat and muscle, great care must be taken to ensure that the sutures or the incision does not contact any vessels or organs. If the bone is adequately stabilized and the surrounding tissue is not compromised, any foreign material that has penetrated the wound should be removed.</start_of_turn>
The remaining bone fragments are to be removed with instruments similar to those used for amputation, but they must be finer and more delicate than other instruments. If any small fragments or splinters remain, they should be removed along with the instruments.
The wound is then to be dressed with incisions and the recommended medications, as mentioned earlier. As for the other side of the work, it is a straightforward procedure, distant from the cavities Galenus has described and praised. It is essential that you first uncover the fractured part of the bone from the area of greatest and most prominent prominence until such time as you uncover the portion that will be fractured at this amputation. This constitutes the anatomical situation...
The fractured part of it is smooth and does not cut through anything. The prominent part of it on the lateral sides extends as far as the tip of the bone. It rests against the periosteum and the sharp face of the fracture is toward the segment.
With a small hammer until you cut through all the bone along with its surrounding tissue as you rotate it. You are in safety from the membrane without causing any significant damage, even if the surgeon is clumsy and people are forced to comply, even if they are obstinate.
If any piece of bone remains embedded in the membrane in some parts of the bone, it should be removed along with the fragment itself. It should be carried away with the fragment without causing any harm or discomfort.
And if the fracture has not penetrated the membrane and if what has been cut from the bone is only the fragment and there remains bone chips and splinters in the vicinity, it is necessary to remove these chips and splinters with the fragment itself. Various sizes of instruments should be used for this purpose so that you can utilize them appropriately in every situation and effect a proper repair based on your judgement.
The fractured bone and its shape, and it should be used in the first place among bones most exposed to these spaces, then use something finer afterwards. Do not stop doing this until it becomes the finest and most delicate of all of them.
As for the smaller cuts and delicate fractures, they should be treated individually according to their suitability, for this is something which anyone skilled in this craft will know. Attention should be paid to what has been written and explained regarding larger fractures
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, you should take two stitches on the amount of the wound and cover it with fat and wax, and place it on the wound opening. Then take another suture of the same size or larger. It is covered in liquid, fat, wax, and placed on the first dressing. This is done with the utmost care, lest it obstruct the peritoneum. Then it is used with a wide bandage and is not tied down except to the extent that it touches the wound only
Leave this treatment for a day or two until the swelling has subsided. Then remove it and use the aforementioned medications that are of great benefit, such as aloes, rhubarb, gypsum, alum, and pistachio, which is to make the greatest of these medications
Leave the wound as it is when it is dry and generally use a medicine that will not irritate, and do not strain yourself while you are healing. Keep the wound clean and free of dirt, fat, and pus.
For indeed, if pus collects on the brain membrane, it will damage and weaken it, and this will cause great harm, especially if it is left untreated and exposed.
The swelling on its surface has subsided somewhat, and the width of the wound has decreased. The symptoms mentioned previously have vanished. Know that the swelling is now healed and there is no possibility of recurrence, even if the swelling occurred from a medicine applied externally and was strong in that medicine.
Take from the vinegar a portion, from olive oil three portions, and mix them together well. Then apply it to the wound with a bandage.
Chapter Three.
In the case of a fractured nose.
Know that the nose does not fracture except for the upper part of it, for the lower part is cartilaginous and does not fracture, but it swells with injury, causing pain and discharge
If one of its parts fractures, then one should enter the small fingers into the hole of the nose and reduce the fracture from inside with the thumb and index finger from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape. But do this cautiously and carefully to prevent any further injury
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the fingers have not been injured, then make a soft pack with a little bulk, and if the fracture is in the two parts, do the same, and do not make a tight bandage on the first day of the fracture
If it is possible, wait until the seventh or eighth day after the injury when the swelling subsides, then enter the nose with a probe and remove the fracture from one hole if it is in one part or two holes if it is in both parts.
The ointment should be applied thickly to the hole of the nose and some of the attendants from the beginning should be told to change the dressing every day. I do not see that, but it is necessary that the dressing be changed in white wool with barley flour mixed in it.
If the bone is fractured and the cartilage is displaced, the surgeon may insert a splinter of reed into the nose at the point where the bone and cartilage meet. This will hold the bone in place and facilitate breathing.
It is not essential to perform this procedure. If you wish, you may make a small incision and insert a splinter of reed. Be sure, however, to widen the nose during the operation and to remove any clots or thick mucus from the cavity.</start_of_turn>
If there is no significant swelling, it is best to drain the cavity carefully with a needle and a syringe. Then, apply a plaster cast to the nose and do not connect the nose to anything.</start_of_turn>
Or, if there is a wound, you should make an incision and evacuate the contents with an instrument. Then, suture the incision and apply an appropriate dressing. If there is damage inside the nose, you should remove the damaged tissue with forceps and use sutures.</start_of_turn> Until it heals.</start_of_turn>
End of excerpt.</start_of_turn>
Compulsory for every physician if the fracture be displaced.</start_of_turn>
If the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not associated with any wound, if only the fracture is outside and not inside, this is known. Knowledge of this will facilitate treatment.</start_of_turn
It is necessary if the fracture is on the right side to insert the index finger of the left hand into the mouth, and if the fracture is on the left side to insert the index finger of the right hand and elevate it to the height of the fracture from inside outwards.</start_of_turn
The external forces which control the movement of the limb are also effective in fractures of the jawbone. If the fracture has split the jaw into two pieces, two nails should be used to stabilize it until the fragments reunite. In cases where the teeth have become loose.
If the fracture has split the jaw into two pieces, a thread or gut may be passed around the fractured area and secured to the overlying fragments. Then an elastic dressing should be placed over the fracture and a pin inserted through it. A large plaster cast should be applied over the pin or a piece of gum should be placed around the pin equal in length to the fractured area. Then the dressing should be secured as needed for the patient's condition and should be maintained until healing has taken place. The patient should be advised to avoid excessive movement and to consume soft food until the pain has subsided. If the patient suspects that something has changed in the condition of the face, they should seek medical attention the following day
Then the dressing should be secured as needed for the patient's condition and should be maintained until healing has taken place. The patient should be advised to avoid excessive movement and to consume soft food until the pain has subsided. If the patient suspects that something has changed in the condition of the face, they should seek medical attention the following day The fracture should be allowed to knit together with the support of barium meal or buttermilk after the teeth have been removed. A soft bandage should be placed over the wound and a bandage should be tied around the area to hold it in place. The wound should not be disturbed until the bone has healed, which should be determined by repeated examination
The fracture should not be disturbed until the bone is completely healed, which should take approximately three months. In the meantime, if there is swelling or heat, the methods mentioned previously should be used to reduce it until it disappears
If there is a wound associated with the fracture, and if any fragments of bone have been displaced or broken, they should be removed using appropriate instruments. If the wound is small, it should be widened to accommodate the dressing
If the fragments have been completely removed and nothing remains, then close the wound if it is wide, or leave one of the sutures in place until it has healed. The wound must be closed until it has healed.</start_of_turn>
The fifth section.</start_of_turn>
If the fracture is displaced, force must be applied to reduce it.</start_of_turn>
The fracture is more likely to be displaced from the front of the bone than from the back. If there are fragments remaining, they are more likely to cause displacement.</start_of_turn
Or if there is a wound alongside the fracture, the work is more difficult. If the fracture is without a wound, one should stretch one limb of the fractured bone towards the side opposite to the wound and the other limb towards the side of the wound.</start_of_turn
Then shape the fracture with your fingers until it is in the desired position and there is no deviation. If further support is needed, place a small piece of bone or cotton under the lower part of the limb.</start_of_turn
The bone must be positioned as needed and the fracture must be elevated and supported by pressing on the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned. If you are unable to pull the limb out to the outside, it is better to leave it inside and place a cushion on the limb.</start_of_turn
A moderate amount of padding is placed under the limb and the servant grasps the limb from below until the fractured bone is raised upwards to the surface. The doctor then shapes the fracture with his fingers until it is properly aligned.
If you suspect that a fragment of bone has fractured and is moving, it is necessary to cut into it and extract it. If the fragment is firmly embedded in the bone, it must be removed by one of the incisions prepared for this purpose. After the abdominal cavity has been opened, the instrument that will protect the intestines is an instrument made of wood or iron. This is its form: ...
It resembles a scoop without a handle. Its width is according to the size of the bone needed and its length also according to what can be done and what is required for the work. It has two ends, with one end wider and the other narrower.
If the wound which you have opened to extract the fragment of bone is large and the swelling is extensive, join the edges of the wound with sutures. If the fracture is still displaced or the swelling is severe, grasp the wound and remove the fragment along with the surrounding tissue.
If the swelling and pain are great, grasp the fracture with forceps and remove the fragment along with fat and bone marrow. As for the bone that has not been fractured, if it is not from a wound or incision, it must be supported by the surrounding soft tissue, such as fat or marrow And put the bandage over it, then place the ball under his armpit if necessary. Then take a long incision that is wide like a sparrow or something similar. Then grasp the surrounding soft tissue firmly with the bandage. The width is three fingers and in length also like that. Then grasp the fracture and insert the loop into the opening. Then insert the fracture with the dressing into the place of the break and tighten the dressing around the fracture as you rotate it If the fracture is on the neck or under the correct rib and the fractured rib, and the pain recurs repeatedly on all sides, and you suspect that the tension is restoring the fracture to its place, then this is what you must do.
Do not remove the swelling from the fractured bone.</start_of_turn> It is necessary to keep the bandage under tension every day. When the tension is released and you see that the swelling has subsided, then tighten the bandage and put the patient in a position where his lower abdomen is elevated at night. Administer a mild sedative.</start_of_turn>
To raise the limb from the flank, elevate the fracture at the level of the scapulae or suspend the arms from the neck. Do not release the bandage unless 12 days have passed without any discomfort or swelling.</start_of_turn>
Then apply the plaster again if you see that the pain persists in that area.</start_of_turn> The tension should be maintained and the bandage should be left in place until the fracture is completely healed and has regained its stability. The more the tension is increased and maintained, the better the fracture will heal in twenty-eight days.</start_of_turn> It is possible in some people for the fracture to heal in less time.</start_of_turn>
Chapter VI.</start_of_turn>
In the case of a fracture of the scapula. Little of the scapula is fractured in the wide position, even if it is fractured in other parts. This is known by feeling and examining the fracture according to its shape.</start_of_turn
Reduce the fracture and stabilize it in its natural position from all sides using the available means. Then put on a bandage with a little paste of alum and butter and a thick cloth. Apply a plaster cast over it.</start_of_turn
The shoulder joint should be rendered completely relaxed or slightly loose. If, however, it is under the influence of a spasm in some part of its position, remove the spasm with ease until the joint becomes steady. Then, tighten from above with a long forceps.
The spasm should be completely removed and the joint should be made steady. The ligament should be gently stretched every day. When the ligament relaxes, tighten it once more and the joint will return to its normal position. However, some pressure should be applied to the correct side of the limb, and the shoulder will be stable in ten days.
Every day or every five days for twenty days. If this period is completed, the ligament will have recovered and will be safe, without fracture or displacement. If there is a prominence of bone that extends under the skin, remove it with forceps.</start_of_turn> Do as I have mentioned concerning the fracture of the scapula if anything of this occurs.</start_of_turn>
Seventh Chapter.</start_of_turn>
On Reduction of a Shoulder Fracture.</start_of_turn>
The shoulder may fracture in its middle or slightly outwards, and this may not be apparent. However, the bones of the limb are more likely to fracture or dislocate. Symptoms include pain in the shoulder, a downward tilt of the limb, severe pain, and anxiety.</start_of_turn>
The limb may be abducted slightly, but the fracture is painful and does not cause pain relief. The limb should be supported between the shoulders and the elbow should be flexed. The hand should be placed over the forearm and the forearm over the shoulder to stabilize the joint.
Once the bone has been shaped as required, apply the paste and powder to it, then pour a layer of plaster of paris over it from a companion trowel made of alabaster or porcelain and press it firmly into the cavity after having pierced it with an awl. Once it has been shaped as desired, apply the paste and powder to it, then pour a layer of plaster of Paris over it from a companion trowel made of alabaster or porcelain and press it firmly into the cavity after having pierced it with an awl. Then, bind the fracture securely to the broken bone so that it does not slip, and pass the bandage around the circumference several times and tighten it firmly, then secure the bandage at all times, and every time the tension is relaxed.
If necessity demands it, if there is an opening in the limb, swelling or tumor, we must address it by removing the cause of the problem before applying the plaster. Then, if necessary, we remove the paste and remedy the cause of the problem before applying the plaster once more. Be cautious and maintain the tension until healing is complete.
The end.
If a limb is fractured, know that the fracture is in the area where there is prominence of the bones towards the back and their extremities from before is where the damage is most likely to be, because of the prominence of the bone there. This is known to the experienced surgeon and is not concealed by palpation
And the physician should know how to align the fractured bones so that the limb can be restored to its normal position, then stabilize and securely bind the fractured bone with a bandage, if necessary, for any displacement. If the fracture is directed inwards, it shows a slight displacement and severe pain.
As for the fracture of the bone which shows an opening, this is the fracture of the limb which is in the area of prominence of the bone towards the back and which is most likely to be displaced inwards, causing great pain and discomfort. This is a serious treatment, and many people have been saved by it
Whoever claims that a meager diet is sufficient to prevent the expansion of the belly and the displacement of its contents, while facilitating the evacuation of broken fragments outside the body – we condemn such claims. For if it had not occurred, the abundance of the ailment would have become evident.
Some claim that gentle pressure applied to the affected area suffices to expel its contents. This is akin to measuring a circumference, except that in the latter case, the flexible tissue expands with the application of pressure. Others contend that the affected area should be covered with a cloth soaked in warm oil to facilitate its expulsion
The pain often extends from the flanks to the abdomen, and if its expansion is not checked, it becomes rigid like a stretched bowstring. Such conditions demand both dietary and medicinal treatment. A severe diet is unbearable to such an extent that one cannot endure it The ribs become painful and rigid, suggesting a fracture. We must uncover the fractured rib and support the abdomen. Then we shall extract the fractured fragment and apply a dressing.
We gather the edges of the wound if it is large and suture them. We apply poultices until healing occurs. If during this process, an abscess becomes evident, we must drain it both externally and internally.
The patient should be placed on the side that was painful until healing takes place.
Chapter IX.
In dealing with fractures of the ribs and spine.</start_of_turn>
Or if the spine has fractured and there is little or no external evidence of the fracture, and if the ribs also display the same, then if any of these were to become evident, you should know whether healing has occurred or not.</start_of_turn> If you see that the head of the instrument has become distorted and flexible, and is neither movable nor stable, and if you cannot straighten or grasp it, and if you puncture or break it with a needle, it will not feel pain and you will find no damage in it. Know that it is dead.
If it can be moved and feels pain when punctured or grasped, know that the bone is fractured and that treatment is of no avail. For if you puncture the back like that, you will learn whether it will heal or not
If you see that the legs are stiff and something is wrong, and that something similar has happened with the hands, and if you force it on the back, wind and feces will come out without your will. And if you lie on your belly, urine will come out without your will. If you lie on your back and are unable to urinate, know that it is dead. Treatment is of no avail for that which has already died, and the best treatment is to calm the inflammation
Place a pack of mustard seeds or a boiled egg over the affected area and repeat this three times a day until the inflammation subsides. Then carry one of the supporting cushions and tightly bind it with a bandage and maintain rest and tranquility.
Do not sleep but on the side which does not cause you pain. Remain awake until it heals. If something has happened to the bone of the thigh or anything else which has healed, you must make an incision and remove that part of the bone.</start_of_turn> Then gather the edges of the incision if it is large with sutures and treat with saline until it heals. If another bone breaks which is the heel of the foot, it is advisable to put the thumb of the left hand into the groove.
The fractured bone is set with the other hand according to what is possible, and then held in place with adhesive and bandage if necessary.
If you feel a broken limb, split it open and extract the splinter. Treat the wound with the treatment that is appropriate until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 10.</start_of_turn>
On setting a fracture of the thigh bone.</start_of_turn>
The thigh bone does not fracture easily. If it does fracture, its fracture will be at the extremities and will incline towards the inside. It will show little swelling and pain in the position and will cause numbness and impair the limb from the fractured side.</start_of_turn
And you must pass your hand over it until it is set as it is naturally. If the fracture is only at the extremities, then set the fracture according to what is appropriate until it resembles its natural shape.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is in the middle or if it has inclined inwards, put adhesive on its belly until it is set. Then put bandage on it and bind it firmly.</start_of_turn
Do not fear the displacement of the fracture or the loosening of the bandage and the inclination of the swelling from the bones until it takes the strain in a straight line and orders the limb to sleep on its back or on its right side, for it has width and swelling.</start_of_turn
Leave it alone and support it until the swelling subsides and carry what relieves it as you proceed. Then go back to the bandage and tighten it as needed. For the width of the bone fragments or the split at the extremities is something that should not be disturbed.</start_of_turn
The wound does not necessitate excision from the outside as we have stated; it should be left closed until it heals.
The Severe Wound.
In the treatment of fractures of the limb.
The limb is that between the shoulder and the head of the arm. If the fracture is close to one of its faces, one can take a reinforcing splint of moderate thickness on this side: .
It is bound at both ends by ligaments, then suspended from a high point and the limb is placed on a chair. Then the fractured bone is taken over by the splint until its joint is firmly fixed to the splint above.
Or the limb is brought down by a servant and the physician holds the fracture with his hands together until the fracture returns to its natural position, and the other side is that the patient should lie on his chest and the physician should bind his hand from his neck with a bandage
Then the attendants are commanded to place one hand above the fracture with his hands and the other below and to bring each of them to his place. If you wish for it to be stronger, bind under the fracture with a bandage and above it with a bandage and each of them is bound by an attendant to his place.
If the fracture is close to the elbow, then the bandage must be placed under the elbow and the other under the fracture towards the shoulder. And if the fracture is close to the shoulder, then the bandage must be placed on that place and on the shoulder itself.
Then the fracture is closed with care without causing pain until the fracture settles in its natural position and the swelling subsides. It is then bound if there is no inflammation. And if there is inflammation, the swelling is left open until the seventh day and is placed on a wet compress made of flaxseed and ointment
If the swelling has settled in the vicinity of the fracture, describe its severity as capable of bearing the medicine on the fracture, then apply a fresh dressing over the medicine and gather the limb on the limb itself and open the hand over the elbow.
If the swelling has subsided in the vicinity of the fracture, describe its severity as adequate to bear the dressing and medicine on the fracture. Then apply a fresh dressing over the medicine and gather the limb on the limb itself and open the hand over the elbow.
And place on the fracture itself a bandage that is broader and stronger than the others and do not make it narrower between any two bandages, but make the length of the bandages three fingers more than the fracture on each side.
Then tighten the bandage as mentioned at the beginning of this section
And make the tension of the bandage stronger in the area of the fracture
Whatever is beyond the fracture, if you see the placement of the bandage and tension as we have mentioned, do it
If you fear that the swelling is severe, leave the tension and bandage as we have mentioned earlier and wait seven days. Then tighten the ligature every three days to see if there is any swelling or congestion or if food is being obstructed from reaching the limb due to excessive tension. All of this will be done as we have mentioned previously
If you are confident that nothing of that will happen, do not tighten the ligature until many days have passed. Keep the limb resting on its side and the hand on its belly and put it under the limb supported by a cushion filled with wool of moderate thickness
And tighten at every time of day or night to see if the shape of the fractured limb is changing or if the ligature is slackening. This must be done with all your effort so that food can be easily passed or if not, make the food softer or lighter until the limb has healed properly.
If the food is retained, it is normal for the limb and foot to swell in forty days. When this happens, it is necessary to drain and use hot foments and treat the pains that result from this. If the fracture is severe, the limb must be immobilized.
It is not permissible to drain it until five days or two months have passed.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 22.</start_of_turn>
On Fractures of the Arm.</start_of_turn>
The arm is composed of two bones, the ulna and the humerus. The ulna is small and extends from the elbow to the wrist, while the humerus is large and lies under the ulna from below the elbow to the shoulder. The fracture may involve only the larger bone, or only the smaller bone, or both bones together.</start_of_turn
If the small ulna fractures above, the limb will be easy to move and the swelling will be less severe. If the large ulna fractures below, the fracture will be severe and the swelling will be great. If both bones fracture together, the bones will be displaced and the swelling will be severe.</start_of_turn
The physician should make the limb move until it is steady. If the large bone is fractured, the limb must be immobilized more severely. If both bones are fractured, the limb must be immobilized even more strongly.</start_of_turn
A bandage should be placed on the limb and the limb should be supported on a cushion. The thumb should be placed above the wrist and the wrist should be lower than the fingers. The elbow should be slightly flexed.</start_of_turn
The cushion should be raised in height so that the elbow does not become painful.</start_of_turn>
The servant of the arm extends from below or with the hand or with a bandage, and the other servant extends from above also. Then the surgeon smooths the bone until it returns to its best shape, and if there are fragments of the bone they are removed.
Return each fragment to its place with effort. If there is a fragment that remains embedded and causes the skin to swell or is painful, cut through it and remove it as described previously. If the fracture is associated with an injury, an incision has already been made for you.</start_of_turn>
Treatment for this is taken from there. The width of the fracture is great and the tumor is hot. The pulse is rapid and the wound has burst. Make incisions cautiously, neither too thick nor too thin. The tumor must be reduced to its proper position.</start_of_turn>
The clot is removed and the prepared dressing is placed from the barley chaff with egg-white. The bones are carried and the surrounding tissue is placed over the fracture itself, showing a little and being strong. Know that the number of bones in the arm is more in most cases.</start_of_turn>
The fracture was either in one bone or in two bones together. Then make the tension on the fracture position stronger and stronger as much as possible, without making it too tight above or below, because that makes the tension weaker.
The incision that breaks the fracture allows the bone to slip and does not leave it rigid. The thread that holds the bones together is specific and of moderate thickness, as described previously. The surrounding tissues are separated after some days.</start_of_turn>
If anything else happens, such as a wound to the organ, it is necessary to wash the organ with water until the wound is healed. Then leave the organ relaxed for a night before tightening again.</start_of_turn>
If the muscle has relaxed and the bone has become slack or something of the sort, mend it all with your effort. Also, if food is obstructing the passage of the muscle, relax it slightly and leave it for a while until the food passes, then tighten it again.
If no apparent change results from what has been mentioned, do not interfere until after twenty days or thereabouts. Then, suspend the limb at its neck and keep its joints steady while preserving his efforts from extraneous movements and make him sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture of the arm will be healed in three days or perhaps in two and a half days, and perhaps in twenty-eight days in accordance with the condition of the wound and the power of the case.
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of a fracture of the wrist and fingers
The extension of the wrist and the movement of the fingers is little in relation to the fracture, but is very great in relation to the wound. When there is a fracture of the wrist or the thumb, the wound is always more prominent
The limb should be placed sitting, supported by something in front of it like a chair.
Then the limb is laid on the bed of the patient and the limb of the fracture is supported by the physician until if it is properly united, then the plaster should be applied over the amount of the wound without causing excessive swelling.
It may be included in the dressing, but if the fracture is towards the lower part towards the palm of the hand, make a sphere-like bulge in the dressing and order the limb to hold it with the fractured limb, then tighten it with a long bandage
If there is a fracture within the limb, the incision should be made over the fracture and around the edges, while tightening all the tissues and closing them as needed. If the fracture is outside the limb, the incision should be made above and below the fracture in order to leave the limb completely open.
The tissues should be pulled as the limb is rotated and bound between the fingers with a bandage. If the width of the fracture is greater than the width of the finger, and if the thumb is fractured, it should be positioned appropriately and then bound along with the limb. If desired, a small incision can be made to stabilize the fracture
The limb should not be moved if the fracture involves the middle, ring, index or small fingers. It should be bound with the adjacent healthy fingers or bound together as a whole. A small incision can be made if necessary to stabilize the fracture.
As we have mentioned regarding the thumb and its vicinity, when the limb is fractured in these areas and swelling occurs afterwards, the fractured part should be immobilized appropriately with what is necessary, whenever possible.
Chapter Fourteen.
On Fractures of the Femur.
The femur is often fractured and causes severe pain because it rotates forward and backward. The incision should be made above and below the fracture and the edges should be approximated with sutures. The width of the fracture should be evaluated to determine the need for additional support.
Then, each ligament that is attached to the fracture should be stretched towards its origin. If the fracture is located in the middle of the bone, and if it is close to the head of the femur, a suture should be placed to stabilize it, either of cotton or silk
When the fracture is located at the hip joint towards the knee, the incision should be made above and below the fracture and the edges should be approximated with sutures. The surgeon should ensure that all tissues are properly repositioned to achieve a natural anatomical appearance
If a bone is fractured soundly, it should be immobilized until the inflammation subsides. If no bone or swelling is displaced, leave it alone. If swelling occurs, drain it immediately to prevent further harm.
As for immobilizing the fracture, it should be strapped with a wide and firm bandage once or twice, leaving some space around the edges. Then, strap the limb until the ankle reaches the crease of the knee, and pass a long thread between the thigh and leg below the knee, securing the edges from above the ankle bone.</start_of_turn>
Then, rotate the leg and thigh what remains of the limb. Then, place the knee in the position of the fracture itself and make a bandage one over the bone of the leg. Fasten the surrounding soft tissue with the remaining threads that are not used for the tension.</start_of_turn>
Then, start tightening gradually from the middle at the fracture site three or four times, and as you bind it from the fracture site, make the tension weaker and softer.</start_of_turn>
Then, pass the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg through the surrounding soft tissue and bind it to the ankle from above.
To prevent the bandage from loosening from its place, leave the tension on it as long as there is no displacement of the bone, swelling or inflammation. If any of these occur, immediately address the issue and rectify all of the above as mentioned previously.</start_of_turn>
If there is a fragment of bone that has shifted, it should be repositioned if possible. Otherwise, drain it and treat the wound as described previously until the swelling subsides. The fracture may be strapped to the thigh without the leg being bound to it.</start_of_turn
In the limb and the forearm, except when the wound is of such a nature as not to show with little elevation, there is no need for elevation of the limb alone.
And know that the thigh swells in five days, sometimes increases slightly or decreases slightly, all of which is according to the different conditions and other situations.
Chapter Fifteen.
Regarding fractures of the ankle bone.</start_of_turn>
The ankle bone is little that shows a fracture and is often hidden by swelling, and if it does show a fracture, it is either a split or a break in its parts, which is with an open wound or without.</start_of_turn>
And it is upon all this that depends, the wounds and the severity of the swelling, which must be treated by whatever can unite the parts of the toes until they are joined and fixed according to what is possible to stabilize and support them, and then to apply the plaster accordingly if necessary.</start_of_turn
And from above we tighten the support in accordance with that, and then we must rest all the conditions that we have described in other fractures like swelling and heat, and that it should meet all the bones that reach it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Chapter Sixteen.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the treatment of fractures of the leg bone.</start_of_turn
For the fracture of the shin bone, one is thick and is called the shin bone, and the other is thin and is called the fibula, and both of them may show different types of fractures.</start_of_turn And for all this, the treatment is the same as for fractures of the arm, whether compound or simple, for if the fracture of both bones occurs, the leg is turned in all directions, and if the fracture of the thinner bone occurs, the leg is turned forward, and if the fracture of the thicker bone occurs, it is from below upwards, which you must know.</start_of_turn
Apply pressure and maintain composure, and suture the tissues according to their condition. This is especially important if the fracture is severe and has many splinters, as less pressure and tension will be required, and your effort will be more effective.
The leg requires less effort than the arm as its bones are more flexible. If you have sutured the tissues and released all your work, take a break from the bone hook that you use to stabilize the compartments between the bone fragments or use coconut fiber or something similar instead.</start_of_turn>
Choose something with little bulk but sufficient length to extend from the knee to the ankle, then wrap around each exit with two layers, and put one on the front and the other on the back of the limb.</start_of_turn>
Wrap from the knee to the ankle, and suture the three points at the ends and middle. This support will prevent the limb from flexing excessively and ensure proper healing.</start_of_turn
And place something to protect it from movement and do this more if there is a particular wound. Then compress the limb daily and pay attention to any swelling, bruising or discomfort.</start_of_turn When any of these things happen, address them accordingly until the bone is healed in three days or so.</start_of_turn>
Chapter Seventeen.</start_of_turn>
In fractures of bones of the leg and fingers.</start_of_turn>
As for the ankle, it does not usually fracture, while the bone of the leg may fracture, and the fingers also rarely fracture. However, they are susceptible to wounds in most cases.</start_of_turn
If the extent of a fracture in a limb is such that some bones have become displaced from their normal position, some of them may have been forced down to the ground while others have been elevated above that level. Then you should place your foot on the elevated bones and press down on them until they settle.
Until they return to their proper place, support the wound and the swelling above the foot with a small cushion having two flat surfaces, then tighten it firmly with the foot after wrapping it around with linen and other necessary materials.
If it has been three or four days and the limb remains unstable, loosen the bandage. If the bones are fractured or displaced, do as you see fit. As for if some fingers are fractured, bandage them and support them as described for hand fractures
Then make the fractured fingers rigid along the fingers and slightly reduce their width. Place the foot under the cushion which was described and tighten it firmly. If more than two or three bones are fractured
Make a plaster cast on each finger, including the proximal interphalangeal joint. Tighten the cushion under the foot so that only the heads of the bones protrude from the bottom of the cushion.
Do not forget all that we have mentioned regarding the symptoms of all fractures and the treatment of each case.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the fracture of a woman's thigh bone and the bone of the hip, and the mentioning of a man.
When a woman's thigh bone is fractured, keep her sitting upright and slightly flex her hip joint. Clamp behind her and support her from behind with cotton until it is filled and becomes like a ball in her thigh
A woman should sit upright and raise her abdomen slightly. The fetus will then emerge through the birth canal like a ball and return to its fractured bones. She should then resume her normal posture when she wishes to urinate, and the fetus will accompany her until she urinates.
The fetus should be expelled as it first entered, and then return to its original position. This should be done for seven days or so, if successful. If desired, a piece of goat’s bladder may be taken and its neck tied with a short tube, and the entire bladder inserted into the birth canal.</start_of_turn>
The bladder should be inflated with force until it expands inside the birth canal, and the fracture will return. Then, insert cotton wool and remain quiet until delivery, as described previously.
The fracture in the pelvic bone is not obvious in most cases, and a woman who has delivered several children understands this book well, for the fracture itself is a sign in many cases.</start_of_turn>
The correct path is surgery and tightening, and understanding will suffice. As for the man, if the thigh bone is fractured at the hip joint, the surgeon should insert a pin there and leave it for three days or so until delivery.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 19.
In the treatment of fractures accompanied by an injury.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary for one who has fractured a large bone, such as the thigh or forearm, accompanied by an injury, to take precautions so that the wound does not worsen from the start, and to seek help from others as required.</start_of_turn>
If the wound is bleeding profusely, pack it with pieces of cotton wool. If this does not stop the bleeding, take hold of the fractured bone in this day with your hand and do not neglect it.
If there is no swelling, but swelling occurs, leave the wound open until the swelling subsides. Do not approach or touch it for three or four days, as this may cause further complications
If the fractured bone is exposed and not covered, pack the wound with soft padding and support it with your hand. If the swelling does not subside with this method, do not attempt to support it with any device made of iron, such as one measuring seven or eight fingers in length And expose the wound area
The physician should take three or four measures according to what is required for each type of fracture in order for the treatment to be effective without causing them to split open at the time of work.
The intensity of the limb's curve is from its tip to its base and is highest from the middle downwards, as in this form:
This is called the "Greek curve," meaning a small ring. The pointed end of the fracture should be placed on the protruding end and be held in place until the bone is set and some straightening of the limb occurs, thus restoring the limb's segments to their proper positions.
If the fractured limb is rigid and has not been held in place, cut off that limb until the device can hold it. If you are unable to stabilize the bone as described above, break it further only with what we mentioned before.
If the bone does not regain its natural position after displacement, and if any portion of it remains fractured or displaced, then know that the bone has not returned to its normal place.
If you are able to reposition the bone to its natural position, do so; this will be of great benefit. If you leave the fracture unreduced, do not immerse the limb in black bile, especially if it is summer, and do not apply any oily or greasy substances to the wound.</start_of_turn>
Do not allow any decay or infection to occur, and apply bandages only when the fracture has been reduced and the wound is left open to air. Cover the wound with coarse sponges so that it can drain adequately.</start_of_turn>
Take great care not to tighten the wound over the fracture, as this will cause the physicians great harm and may result in serious illness, death, paralysis, or deformation.</start_of_turn>
If the wound is slight or if it is large and you suspect some underlying condition that makes it difficult to heal, and if it is painful and swollen, do not apply any bandages and make a tight dressing over the wound.</start_of_turn
If after a day or two you notice that pus is forming in the wound or that the swelling has increased, remove the dressing and apply an ointment such as beeswax or alum, which are commonly used for treating wounds.</start_of_turn
The wound must be cleansed every morning and evening until it heals completely, and do not move the limb excessively, as this will cause small fragments of bone to break.</start_of_turn>
The wound must be opened carefully with a lancet, and whatever splinters are embedded must be removed. As for those that are not embedded, they must be scraped away and removed. This will prevent damage to the organ and cause no further pain.
If the wound is wide or deep or of another type of swelling and pus, then each variety must be treated according to its kind.
And what must be avoided is to break a large bone or fracture an organ like the femur or humerus, which are large organs, without causing them to protrude or be extruded For this reason, many of these cases result in death, while others recover naturally after a period of eighteen days or three months
The physician should treat the wound if he sees a place for treatment, or leave it alone otherwise.
Twenty days.
Treatment of complex fractures that appear as a result of some breaks.
Many times this complication appears as a result of excessive bone bending or pressure, which causes the organ to become deformed and may prevent it from functioning normally
It has been observed that when the complication is mild, some medications such as camphor, colocynth, rhubarb and vinegar, and some of these or all of them can be used with camphor or white lead or with oil
It is carried on the complication in pain and tightened over it firmly and for a while, and then it is loosened and the tension is removed only when the complication has gone, God willing, or when a solid sheet of lead is placed over it
If there is a specific kind of suture, it goes through everything that is in the organs. If the adhesion has become dense and strong, and the necessity has increased, then it should be opened from above or cut out with some incisions until the wound has gone and the ailment has been remedied.
Chapter twenty-one.
In the treatment of fractures if it has been displaced and the limb remains elevated afterwards, it becomes more rigid than its original state.
If a fracture has been displaced and the limb remains elevated afterwards, this is often due to various causes Some of the causes of this include excessive tension of the ligaments and their displacement from their normal position, excessive tension of the ligaments so that the food cannot pass easily through the organ, excessive movement at an inappropriate time, or lack of blood supply to the limb and weakness
Treatment for this involves elevation of the limb and application of cold packs, administration of pain relievers and antibiotics, and giving the limb rest, and carrying out physical therapy, etc. Until the limb returns to its normal state
Chapter twenty-two
In the treatment of a fractured bone if it has been displaced and its function has been hindered
When the limb has become wider after displacement of the fracture or fracture of the bone or adhesion and swelling of the wound It is not permissible for the limb to have become wider after displacement of the fracture or fracture of the bone or adhesion and swelling of the wound. Many ignorant people and impostors claim that the limb must be fractured from the top and many physicians and healers do this in our land.
If the swelling is severe, it is not appropriate to perform this action, as it poses great risk to the physician. However, if the swelling is slight and manageable, water may be used to bathe herbs such as chamomile, artemisia, fennel, and mint.
These anti-inflammatory drugs, such as alum or powdered alum, should be applied as a compress, or a decoction of artemisia should be taken with oil of fennel and butter, or with quince paste and pounded pomegranate seeds
The stiffness will vanish with prolonged gentle pressure, which should be applied to every part at all times. If the swelling has increased in size and firmness and if there is need for urgent treatment.</start_of_turn>
The bone should be fractured and the fractured parts separated. The excess tissue should be cut away. The limb should be supported by a bandage, with care and attention. Then the wound should be treated as usual until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 32.
The elbow is a dislocation of a joint from its place, which hinders movement, deforms the limb, and causes severe pain. Therefore, whenever the elbow dislocates, it is necessary to reduce it as soon as possible.</start_of_turn>
It does not matter if the swelling subsides, as long as the dislocation persists. It is not advisable to move or rotate the limb, as this can worsen the dislocation and cause excruciating pain.
But if it appears in a place where the wound must not be opened, then one should leave it until the swelling subsides somewhat, then wash the part with hot water and fat, and then apply pressure and treat every part according to its location.
The sections of the jaw have also been arranged according to their progression from the top of the body to the bottom
The twenty-fourth section
In the treatment of the lower jaw
Little remains of the jaw except for the fracture and the displacement of the teeth from their sockets. This either happens because the fracture is extensive, or because the teeth are slightly displaced, or because they are completely loosened and separated until they rest. Down to the chest, until the saliva of the lower lip drips and cannot be held back, or that the jaw cannot be closed and the tongue is protruded by speech. If the displacement is slight, it often returns by itself without difficulty.
If the displacement is complete and entire, it is necessary to expedite its reduction and not delay it. This is done by grasping the lower lip with the thumb and index finger of the hand and pushing inwards from the origin of the jaw inwards the mouth if the jaw is fractured from only one side
Or he inserts his thumb and index finger from outside and all the other fingers of his hand into the jaw and holds the lip with them. He then commands the patient to open and close his jaw wide, and he himself adjusts the jaw and positions it back in its place
If its reduction is slow or if the teeth are all fractured, use water and fat compresses until their reduction is facilitated and does not impede it. If they return and rest, and the mouth is closed without tension, then put over them a bandage of wax and fat and pressure.
If the belly is relaxed and the wound closed, the patient will experience little pain on his back and head, and the swelling will be confined between two layers, so that it will not move either up or down or to the sides, and will not be affected by any movement, but will make his food feel harsh to him.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is closed, he should not eat anything. It is not the swelling or the wound that causes discomfort, but rather the opening of the mouth during eating and drinking until the jaw is closed and the wound is healed
If the jaw is not properly closed even after it has healed, it will cause persistent pain, swelling and possibly vomiting and diarrhea. If you observe any of these symptoms, you should know that the wound has failed
It will often happen within ten days.
The Fifth and Thirtieth Chapters.
On the Jaw and the Tip of the Ear
Or if the swelling [of the wound] does not go down from inside outwards, but rather from outside inwards, it will cause pain, and the patient will feel the swelling on his back and raise his arms.
Then you should put your hand over the wound and apply pressure, and when it returns, put on the dressing and bandage and bind it, and as for the side which is towards the ear, do not remove the dressing until the wound has healed. Otherwise, if you remove it one day, it will open up again and you will have to start over from the beginning as we have mentioned before
Then apply the dressing and bandage and bind it and order the patient to lie still and rest until it heals, and with this treatment the tip of the ear will also heal if it has not shifted from its place.
Sixth and Twenty-sixth Chapter.
In the treatment of fractures of the mandible (jawbone).
Know that the mandible is fractured in three places: one fragment runs from the angle towards the chin, the second from the angle towards the chest, and the third from the angle towards the upper jaw. This is how it fractures in the wound
It does not fracture behind the angle of the jaw or in front of the nerve. It mostly fractures and exits downwards towards the angle, especially in those with little soft tissue because it comes out quickly and goes in quickly
And as for those who have much soft tissue, it is different. It may go out quickly and come out quickly, and perhaps cause a wound or bruise, so that the fracture of the mandible appears when there is a blow or fall, and the patient thinks that it has fractured, while in reality it is not fractured.
The examination of the fracture progresses, and if the jaw is found to be fractured downwards towards the angle and if it is grasped between the fractured and healthy teeth, you will find between them a space that appears abnormal, and you will find the head of the fractured tooth displaced and below the level of the opposing teeth as if it were an egg.
It is not possible for the cause to lift its hand to its ear or to move it in any way, neither if it fractures towards the chest or upwards. This will appear obvious on examination but will not be painful.
And this fracture may be easily reduced if the patient was young or if the cause was a slave. The slave would raise his hand above his head, then the cause would grasp his hand under his jaw and lift the jaw to its place. The slave would then raise his hand and lower it above.
If it returns quickly, wash it down immediately. If it does not return, what we mentioned has been there for a long time. In that case, it is best to soak the little finger in hot water and use an astringent that soothes and softens, such as alum, rhubarb, and myrrh.
The little finger is laid on its back and a ball of wool is placed under its armpit. The ball should be neither too loose nor too tight. The physician then places his hand behind the ball and grasps the little finger with his hand and pulls it downwards
The ball is pushed upwards until it returns to its place. If desired, the procedure can be repeated with a longer probe inserted from the flank and passed under the armpit, and the armpit is elevated until the little finger is suspended in the air Another assistant grasps the little finger downwards if it is hidden. If the little finger is hidden, something else must be used to support it. If it returns after a while, the jaw can be closed. It may also return on the other side
The assistant should place a long, cylindrical object such as a horn at the base of the little finger. The head of the horn should be rounded, neither bulky nor slender. The horn is placed under the armpit after placing a break above the head of the horn. The little finger is then placed along the length of the horn.
Then the hand and the body are also pulled down from the other side with force. If the joint returns to its place quickly, if all that was mentioned has been done, use this treatment, which is to take a stick that is about the length of an arm. And expose it as much as four fingers and compress it as much as two fingers. It should have a rounded head that facilitates its insertion into the armpit in this manner.
The fractured bone is stabilized by a screw at the vertex, and then it is bent under the armpit and the hand is stretched over the bone to the wrist, and the bone is sutured to the forearm and elbow and the tip of the hand.
The limb is placed on the opposite side. The arm is stretched out and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is kept suspended from the other side, except for the elbow joint which is allowed to enter from its socket. If it enters from any other side, it is necessary to place under the armpit a cushion of moderate size filled with wool.</start_of_turn>
The dressing is carried out with charcoal powder with milk and egg white on the entire circumference as it rotates from above. Then the sphere is tied from under the armpit tightly and bound with a bandage from above and the hand is fixed to the neck.</start_of_turn>
It is left still for seven days, and it is necessary to reduce the diet until the limb is strengthened. Then it is healed after seven days or five days, and it is moved and exercises are performed if it has recovered.</start_of_turn>
If the elbow joint dislocates frequently due to excessive pressure or other reasons, it is necessary to use three straps on the bone of the elbow as it advances in the elbow joint. If this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days, and the elbow joint has not stabilized.</start_of_turn>
The dressing was applied and bound several times, but it did not stabilize and fell off and became limp and could not be raised above. This indicates that the nerve at the elbow has been cut or stretched or become limp, so it is known that the elbow will never stabilize in its place.</start_of_turn>
If the jaw is displaced towards the chest and the back of a person, it is to be reduced by palpation and manipulation of the hands until it returns. All forces and treatment are to be used until it is healed. If after healing, there is swelling in the organ or stiffness in the movement.
The swelling should not be prolonged, but should be treated frequently until the swelling subsides and the organ returns to its natural position.
Seventh and Twenty-eighth Chapter.
On the Treatment of Displaced Jaw
The jaw is displaced towards the chest and the back as well as towards the front and back. It is displaced in all directions, especially towards the front and back. One must take note of it because it is under observation and under palpation of all forms of displacement
If the jaw is correctly displaced, it will be evident to you by the deviation of the jaw from its normal position, which will prevent the arm from being raised or lowered from the shoulder. It is necessary to take precautions and reduce the jaw from your grasp before it swells.
If there is swelling after healing, the jaw will remain displaced and the swelling will not be eliminated. This will further impede the healing process, especially if the jaw is displaced towards the back. In such a case, all types of displacement must be avoided as much as possible.
If there is something that can cause it to return, the servant should grasp both hands and put his thumbs and fingers under the jaw. The physician should grasp from above the jaw and from below it, and he should push the jaw inwards with his thumbs until it returns to its place.
If the jaw is displaced towards the front, grasp the thumb with one hand and the fingers of both hands with the other hand until you reach the base of the thumb. If the jaw does not return, use strong force by stretching the arm servants and pushing with the palms of your hands
The skilled assistants must also be attentive lest they disappear when the limb is immersed in water, then the arm is moved in all directions after the sponge has been placed on the hand, either tightly bound or loosely covered with cotton wool. If the physician grasps the hand firmly when the sponge is being applied, it will facilitate the displacement of the joint with ease.
The joint is then driven forcefully until it returns. Once it returns, the medication which has been placed within should be carried along with the secretion of the egg white and be bound tightly with a bandage, and the arm should be suspended from the ulnar process and the palm of the hand should be left free
The joint is then firmly immobilized in its place and released. If the joint is not adequately stabilized, the medication and bandage should be reapplied and the arm should again be suspended until it is sufficiently stabilized, then the joint is released once more. If there is any swelling or pain remaining after the joint has been released, the medication and bandage should be reapplied once more until the swelling or pain has subsided.
The limb must be moved cautiously during recovery from the bath and the water-warming treatment, until the swelling has subsided or until the joint becomes as supple as before. Then the bandage should be applied and the arm should be left in it for a day or two, then it should be removed and the joint should be placed back into the bath, where it should remain until the swelling subsides.
Then the procedure is repeated once more and twice more with the joint placed back in the bath until the swelling subsides, if desired. If one wishes to make the joint supple once more, they should apply ointment liberally to the limb and bind it firmly.
Chapter VIII.
On treating the Fracture of the Jawbone.
The jawbone is often fractured and its fracture is easy compared to other joints, except that it must be quickly stabilized before it is displaced or its position is altered, causing swelling and heat in the area
If the small finger is displaced, place its base on a board. Have the assistant grasp the hand and place the physician's thumb on the metacarpal bone and push until it returns to its place. However, observe if the finger has gone into the palm of the hand.
If the small finger is displaced, place its tip on the board. If the finger has gone beyond the palm of the hand, place the hand base on the board so that the physician's thumb rests on the same metacarpal bone. If it returns by itself, leave it alone. Otherwise, bind the swelling with a dressing.</start_of_turn>
Leave it alone if it returns by itself and does not necessitate movement. Otherwise, if the metacarpal bone remained upright and the finger still cannot be reduced, do not grasp it.</start_of_turn>
It is known that the ulnar nerve is severed or displaced. There is no help in this except to grasp the limb firmly, which may be useful or not. If the finger returns to its place, apply a bandage as described previously and grasp it. Leave it for five days.</start_of_turn>
Then, move the hand and if there is still pain and swelling, soak it in warm water and apply poultices repeatedly until the swelling subsides.</start_of_turn>
Chapter ten.
On treating finger fractures.</start_of_turn>
The fingers may be displaced in various directions. If the finger is displaced towards the palm of the hand or beyond it, grasp the hand and push until the finger returns to its place. Then, stabilize the base of the finger and bind it towards the affected area.</start_of_turn
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend its duration until its condition stabilises on that day. If it is night, tie it to the description itself; it will not dissolve during the day and will recover its mobility and movement. Tie it at night to do this every day until it becomes firm.
Do the same if it bursts inside the hand, tying it to the part itself and doing as you did at the first time until it heals. Do the same whenever it bursts in any other place.</start_of_turn>
Three days have passed.</start_of_turn>
Treatment for a fractured spine.</start_of_turn>
When a vertebra fractures from the ribs or the neck, or if many fractures have shifted from their places, there is no treatment for it because death is imminent.</start_of_turn>
This indicates that the pangs of death will inevitably erupt without warning, and often some of one's limbs or parts of the body will be paralysed either temporarily or permanently, or if one fracture shifts from its place, many will not recover.</start_of_turn
It will be gone in four directions, and when it goes backwards it is called a hump. As for its treatment, look at it. If the hump has occurred from youth, there is no treatment for it, and there is no improvement from applying pressure. But if it is from a fall or blow, and the like of it.</start_of_turn
I have forgotten the beginning of the treatment with words that are long and will not return to me. Some of it has been omitted from what I have mentioned previously due to the abundance of matters which I have mentioned and the shortness of space.
The pain that originates from the chest in front has no remedy, neither does the pain that originates from the back of the head. However, the pain that originates from the loin is special, for it is treated by stretching the face outwards.
The physician should sit close to the patient, and place his hand on the patient's chest and shoulder, and press down firmly with his hand towards the abdomen, and then insert a splinter of wood into the pit of the earth on the right side of the patient and another splinter on the left side of the patient.
A servant should grasp the splinter and make it ineffective in the pit, and another servant should grasp the other splinter on that side. Then the physician should command the patient to lift his chest and pull down his abdomen with his hands, and stretch out his face towards the splinter on his head and tie it there
Then stretch out the other bands above the knees and the ankles and at the navel. Then gather all the bands and tie them to the other splinter that is at the left side, and stretch out both attendants towards their splinter with the bands.
Do not make them ineffective as we have said. The physician should place his palm on the prominence with force until it returns or place a board thereupon and press on the board with his leg until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, take a board that is about the length of three fingers.
And dig in the prominence where we have mentioned that it should be close to the navel a place where the edge of the board enters. And place the middle of the board on the prominence and put the physician's leg on the other side and tighten it strongly until it compresses the prominence.
And it will return to its place. If you wish, you can bind it with the thread that is used by the hand, which is to insert it into the earth at the tip of the chest at the end of the treatment, and two splinters at the end of the treatment on the right side and two splinters at the end of the treatment on the left side.
After every swelling has been drained and a hole has been made in every swelling, the loop is passed and the wood is bound to the ground except for when it is necessary to prevent the swelling from moving and entering the handle of the loop.
After every swelling has been drained and a hole has been made in every swelling, a loop is passed and the wood is bound to the ground, except when necessary to prevent the swelling from moving and entering the handle of the loop.
Then the assistant grasps the handle of the loop with his hand and the surgeon smoothens out the edges of the hole that has been made. This is the position of the loop and the handle:
Then, after the abscess has drained and the hole has been made, the cautery should be grasped by the assistant with his hand and the surgeon should smooth out the edges of the hole that has been made. This is the position of the loop and the handle. Then, after the sponge has been placed and the incision has been closed, a piece of sponge should be placed over the incision which should be approximately three finger-widths wide and as long as the thickness of the incision.
And on some swellings, some stitches should be placed first, then the loop should be tied with the ligature which should be used. The dressing should be soft until the swelling has subsided. If there is still some prominence remaining in the place at the end of the dressing, some medicines should be used which will soften and relax, along with the use of the sponge which was mentioned previously.
Some plates of lead may be used for this, and there may be prominence at the end of the stitches. This is the bone which has been left behind and will not be affected by this treatment for it may die.
The Severe Wound of the Third Degree.
In the treatment of a severe wound of the third degree.
I know that the hip joint and the knee joint are exposed only to the fracture and not to the ordinary slipping and pressure which affect the other joints. The hip joint is fractured on four surfaces.
And thus it is fractured inwards, outwards, forwards and backwards, and more inwards and less outwards. The sign of fracture inwards is that if you join the healthy leg to the patient, it will be longer.
The hip is more flexible than the knee and the limb will not bend at the hip when carried horizontally, and if the limb is carried vertically, the thigh will reach the buttock which was not previously touching it.
The sign of fracture outwards is its symptoms are opposite to these symptoms. The sign of fracture forwards is that if he extends his limb fully, although he does not bend his knee, his thigh will reach the buttock which previously did not touch it
He clutches his thigh and is unable to flex his knee, although he can extend his limb fully. The sign of fracture backwards is that he cannot flex the hip and his limb is shorter than the other limb
The limb is relaxed and the head of the femur is at its proper place. As for the other two types of fracture, their sign is that if you look, if the fracture is recent, the limb has not recovered and remained in its previous position, there is no treatment for the fracture.
It is not permissible to expose it. And as for the type which is fractured from any of these two types, it is from four surfaces.
If it does not return after treatment, then one must make a servant of any strong arm to bend the leg from below or with the hands or with both hands, and tie a bandage above the knee and another servant to extend it from above.
If it does not return after treatment, then one must make a servant of any strong arm to bend the leg from below or with the hands or with both hands, and tie a bandage above the knee and another servant to extend it from above.
And the extension of all of them is together until the limb rises up from the ground and remains hanging, for this type of extension is common to the four types, and if the limb does not return after what we mentioned, then there is no option but for each type to have its special treatment.
Or if the limb is inward, then it must be placed upon the correct side of the limb and the bandage must be tied upon the thigh between the head of the thigh and the part under the buttock
Then the bandage is extended from below from the buttock to the top of the body to the knee and another servant is taken with two strong arms and grasps the thick part of the thigh and extends it outwards as much as it returns to its place
This type is easier than the rest of the treatments, for if you are unable to do this type of treatment, then it is better to tie the limb strongly with a bandage above the ankle and below the knee
And after each one of them has reached four fingers, and the thigh is more extended than the other by two fingers, then the limb is hung from the heel on a beam that is in the house, and there remains from the ground as much as two arms.
The strong servant must hold the thigh firmly and grasp the ankle of another servant, while the third servant grasps the knee with force. When the joint returns to its place quickly, the reaction will be specific if the jaw is outside.
The servant must grasp the heel on the cushion according to what we have described for the owner of the limb and tighten the ligament on his thigh specifically and on his chest. Then place one chisel at the ankle and the other at the knee, and place the third chisel in the middle of the cushion securely
There is a fracture of the bone of the thigh which extends downwards. The chisel must not be placed between the thigh bones, as this would cause them to slip downwards, but the servant must extend each limb and the physician should stabilize the hip with his hands. If the joint returns to its place, the reaction will be positive.
There is no need to place a plate and bandage as described for the limb. If necessary, the assistant should grasp the limb on the correct side. If the dislocation is downwards, the servant must extend the limb in this position on the cushion
The physician places his right hand on the upper thigh and his left hand grasps and compresses the thigh with all his strength. Despite this, the pressure must be sustained downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is to the back of the knee, the servant must extend the limb downwards
The limb is high up and must be placed on something solid. The limb must also be supported from the front and back as described for the displacement of the limb on the cushion, and the ligaments must be taut.
As we have mentioned previously, the cushion and plate must also be used at the place where the joint came out of place. If the hip joint returns to its place as described, and the sign of return is not hidden, that is to say that the limb must be extended.
If you see that a limb is swollen and rigid, and contracts the limb without difficulty, know that the limb has returned to its normal position. Then tighten the bandage firmly around the limb and hold it in place.
The swelling has subsided. Keep the limb quiet for three or four days, then loosen the bandage and support the limb, and if the limb is still swollen, know that the bone has regained its normal position. If you see any relaxation, it is a sign that the swelling has subsided.
Tighten the bandage firmly and keep the limb quiet for three days. Then loosen the bandage and support the limb until it recovers, God willing
The second and third days.
Treatment of hip fractures.
The hip joint is displaced in three directions: inward, outward, and downward, but not forward. A sign of displacement is that the limb is unable to move smoothly in any direction other than forward
If the thigh is not plastered, know that the hip is displaced. Tighten all aspects of the hip joint so that the limb can rest on the heel and the lower limb can be flexed slightly backwards and forwards, but not forwards.
Fasten your buttocks to the front of your thigh and put your foot between your thighs. Then grasp the thigh with your hand and pull the limb towards you and tighten the bandage on the thigh with the other hand. Keep your thigh bent slightly towards your buttocks and support the hip with your hand until the hip joint returns to its normal position
The limb is naturally aligned with the hip socket without undue pressure, then tighten the bandage and support the limb until it heals. Do not use excessive walking until it recovers
If it is impossible for you to return it to its original state as described, then use the maximum strength of the bands that are recommended for treating the hip until it returns to its normal position.
Chapter 33.
In the treatment of dislocation of the hip
The hip may be dislocated forward or backward, and the sign of dislocation is that the hip appears swollen and prominent towards the side from which it dislocated
Or if it is impossible for you to return it to its original state as described, then use the maximum strength of the bands that are recommended for treating the hip until it returns, and if it has dislocated from the socket, sit down and grasp it with a strong hand from behind your back in the middle
Then grasp your right foot with your right hand and your left foot with your left hand at the ankle joint, then draw up your right foot and then the left foot twice, then stretch out your left foot and push forward your right foot towards the leg without straining.
Do this twice as we have described, then push forward your right foot towards the leg in the third attempt and hold the ankle joint, and if it returns in one or two attempts and you see the foot is level, then repeat the procedure.
If it is impossible for you to return it to its original state as described, then use the maximum strength of the bands that are recommended for treating the hip until it returns. If it does not return, put your foot on the ground and hold it firmly against the ground with your hand, and make a break between the thigh bones and put a bandage around it so that it does not cause further damage, then grasp the thigh firmly with your hand.
If a patient's leg is hanging down, the assistant should grasp it by hand or by its ankle and pull it up. Then, the surgeon should grasp the limb opposite to the pull in the normal way and with the thumb and index finger placed between the thigh bones, touching the genitals to prevent the body from slipping down during the pull. The surgeon should then straighten the limb with the hands.
If the limb is grasped too tightly and the surgeon withdraws his hand quickly, the limb may become swollen and painful. If the limb is withdrawn and appears normal, carry the limb up with force and bind it securely with ligatures and tighten it. Grasp the foot with the ligature at the bottom.</start_of_turn>
In order not to tighten the ligature too much, leave it for two or three days. If the ligature relaxes, tighten it again on the fourth or fifth day. The patient should refrain from walking for forty days.</start_of_turn>
If the limb has not recovered after this period of time and the pain persists, and there is swelling, it is necessary to use more forceful treatment than the methods mentioned previously.
Day 40.</start_of_turn>
Treatment of limb fractures.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary to stabilize the fracture without causing additional pain. This can be done without haste, as it is easier. If the fracture is located in the ankle joint, the patient should be advised to keep their foot flat on the ground.</start_of_turn>
Or on a board which is firm like wood. Then place your foot on what remains of the joints and grasp it with your foot with force until it becomes steady and you see that it has recovered and is no longer displaced.</start_of_turn
If you place a plaster under the sole of the foot, and bind the limb tightly with three bands, it will heal and be secure within several days.
The fifth part [of the foot] and a third.
In all kinds of fractures that are with wound or fracture or both together
When any of these things happen and the wound is treated and the fracture is set, the limb will not die
And it is not necessary to repeat the treatment like that except for those who are experienced and skilled in surgery and have great experience and are calm and do not rush and do not fear and use only soothing medications and evacuate the least amount possible.
May God help us except that He makes the cure easy and shows us some relief from the disease and there is some hope for us that He will restore it back to its original state before the wound appeared.
If it returns to its place, use soothing medications and treat the wound and whatever reaches it of powders and dried herbs, and if the bone is fractured and there are displaced splinters, remove them. Follow what we mentioned in minor illnesses and do not advance in places where you are not skilled
And release your effort and your soul from the temptation of entering into the ditch on what you are advised of and what is safe for you, for that is better for your effort and your safety if God wills it.
