of arrows / arrowheads
Arrows/Arrowheads are diverse, according to their appearance and according to the places of the body where they fall/land.
Their diversity is such that there are some that have large points, and small ones, and are bladed, and barbed; and some that have two barbs, and some that have tongues, and some that are in pieces; and one which falls into a limb can fall in two ways: either in a principal member's head, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. 
When it falls then in any place in these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you about later, appear to you: then you must abstain from extracting this arrow, because death follows in many ways; and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not deep, then draw it out, and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain, when the arrow lodges there and pierces the bone, and the membrane which is over the brain spurts out, are dizziness and fainting and turning green and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood comes out of the nostrils, or the ears; and perhaps loss of speech and voice; and a white moisture resembling pus comes out of the wound, and also something like burnt flesh; and if these signs appear to you, abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not embedded.
The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are that it is near the left nipple, and feels as if it were stuck in something hard, not hollow; and perhaps the arrow moves like the pulse, and black blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat come, and fainting: know then without doubt that death is imminent.
And the sign of the arrow that pierces the lung is that blood full of froth comes out of the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs deeply and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow falls into the covering of the chest, it is near the small ribs; and causes great difficulty breathing and great pain and sighing; and all the limbs from the shoulders down twitch.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, perhaps some undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the belly, and feces come out of the wound through a ruptured intestine, there is no hope in treatment, nor in extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out of it abnormally, and the patient feels intense pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other limbs, such as the face and the neck and the throat and the shoulder and the armpit and the spine of the back and the forearm and the thigh and the legs, and similar limbs, are safe according to various factors.
When the arrow is in the nerve or the artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of the nose: I probed it, and pulled it out the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I pulled an arrow from a young man that had struck him in the fat of the eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow was embedded, and I could only reach the tip towards the shaft, and the arrow was from a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs; the young man was healed, and no ill effects came to him.
And I pulled an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabian with barbs: I flattened the barbs, and worked carefully until I pulled it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I pulled an arrow from a man, that had fallen into his belly, and I thought he would die; and after thirty days had passed, his condition did not change; I cut down to the arrow, and manipulated it, and pulled it out, and he had no ill effects.
And I also saw a man who had an arrow fall into his back, and the wound closed over it; and the arrow remained inside him, and his natural disposition did not change, nor did he find any harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, who had an arrow fall into his thigh, and the wound closed; and it remained thus without causing great pain; and many other similar cases.
And I pulled an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had fallen in the middle of his nose, and was slightly inclined to the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded. I was called to treat it three days after it had fallen.
I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a very fine tent, and did not feel it; yet he felt a pricking and pain under his right ear.
I thought it was from the point of the arrow. I applied an attractive and digestive plaster to the area, so that the place would not swell; and the location of the arrow appeared to me.
I applied the plaster for many days, and the wound healed over again, and the patient remained like that for a long time, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose; and he told me.
I applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for many days, until it opened, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow, which was lodged in place; then I added more of that sharp medicine into the opening of the wound, until the head of the arrow appeared visibly to me; and the period of about four months passed, and then the wound widened so that I inserted the forceps, and moved it from side to side, but it could not come out; then I did not cease to refine and devise various instruments, until one day I grasped it with well-made forceps, such as its form will appear at the end of this chapter, until I pulled it out, and healed the wound.
And physicians believe that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I then restored it, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely cured.
Now I have told you the nature of extracting some arrows, so that you may apply your care to what I have not said, for the book cannot encompass everything; but the wise master understands a great deal from very little, and from what is present and lacking, finds new work, and a new instrument, for the removal of the strange things that occur in this art.
I say that arrows do not come out of the limbs where they are embedded except in two ways: either through the place where they entered, or through another part; and the one that comes out through where it entered, that is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes comes out immediately.
And if it does not come out immediately, leave it until the flesh around it is rotted, and the exit is widened; and also if it is embedded in the bone, and it cannot come out, leave it like that for some days, and move it every day; and then it will come out, and if it does not come out, then pierce around it with a very fine drill, until the place around it is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is embedded in the bone of the head, and goes as far as one of the ventricles of the brain, and any of the accidents that I have mentioned appear in the patient: do not pull it out, but leave it until it is even after some days, because if the arrow reaches as far as the meninges, it is death.
And if the arrow is only embedded in the bone, and does not reach the meninges, and the patient remains for some days without ill effects, then devise a way to pull it out.
And if it is embedded very deeply and cannot come out otherwise, then apply drills around it, as I have told you; then treat the place until it is healed.
And if the arrow is lodged in a place in the body where it cannot be seen, then search for it with the probe; and if you feel it, pull it out with a suitable instrument; and if you cannot because of the narrowness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone or nerve or vein there, then enlarge the wound until it is large; and pull out the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs which hold it in place, then remove the flesh that is embedded in them from both sides as best you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, so that you can pull it out; and be very careful not to break the arrow, as you would have more difficulty pulling it out.
And if you cannot do it at once, leave it until the surrounding area is putrefied, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier.
And if the flow of blood hinders you, then apply what we have said about the treatment in its chapter; and beware of cutting a nerve or vein, and devise how you can best pull out the arrow without danger, either quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently; and position the patient according to the position he was in when the arrow struck him, for this is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then position him according to what the symptoms indicate.
The arrow that emerges from the other side, where some part of it appears, or the skin is swollen around it so that it can be seen or felt clearly: then cut over it, so that the forceps can grip it, and then pull it out: it should come out immediately.
And if it is stuck in the bone, then rotate your hand circularly, until it enters the bone, and widen the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, then leave it again, and then resume the extraction until it comes out; and if the shaft of the arrow is there, push it in with the whole shaft; and if the shaft falls off, and you wish to apply pressure, then apply a hollow instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the hollow of the instrument; and then push it out, and if the arrow is barbed, apply an instrument with an inward-pointing tip, to facilitate the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must cut away all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as appropriate.
And if the arrow falls in the chest or the abdomen or the bladder or the side, and it is close, and you can cut over it, then cut; and be careful not to cut the vein or the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which one extracts arrows is similar to a bird's beak, and see here the shape: 
And there are many kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the pushing instrument is also like a bird's feather, to push against the tip of the arrow, as here is the shape:
The shape of the forceps for pushing and for pulling is here:
