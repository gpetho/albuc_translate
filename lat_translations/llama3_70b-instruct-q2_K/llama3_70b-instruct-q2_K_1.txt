Praefatio.	Foreword.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I had completed for you, sons, this book, which is the last part of science in medicine with its complement, and I had reached the end in it, from its explanations and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise, which is a part of operation, that is, surgery with hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Because the operation with hand is laid out in our region and time, and has been utterly privatized: so that perhaps the science of it has perished, and its investigation has been cut off: and there did not remain any of it, except for small descriptions in ancient books, which were distorted by hands: and error and hesitation occurred, until the intentions of it were closed, and its force was elongated. It seemed to me that I should revive it with the ordering of this Treatise, according to the way of positioning, declaration, and abbreviation: and so that I might bring it together with the forms of cauterium instruments, and other tools of work: as it is fitting from declarations of addition, and from its proper preparation which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good craftsman of it with his hand is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long and it is necessary for its author to have exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy, which Galen described, so that he may know the juiciness of members, and their forms, and their conjunction, and separation, and have cognition of bones, and nerves, and ligaments, and their number, and their egressions, and veins pulsating, and quiet ones, and exit places.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And on account of this, Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have now spoken about it in the introduction of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Because whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said about anatomy will not be cautious, lest they already fall into error, by which men are harmed: just as I have seen many of those who are formed by this science, and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened was that a foolish doctor cut into a scrofulous apostem on the neck of a woman and severed certain arteries in her neck, so that her blood flowed out, until she fell dead at his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And another foolish doctor who attempted to extract a stone from a man's testicle, which was swollen at the time, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore approached him, and extracted it along with a piece of his bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I had already been called in to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the sick man that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who received a stipend from a certain Duke of our land because of his medical practice: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, that he had a fracture in his leg near the ankle: and the doctor, with his ignorance, treated the fracture with poultices, and bound it tightly with a bandage, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he dismissed him according to his foolish desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he sent him away for several days and instructed him not to remove the bandage: and it remained thus until his leg became infected and his foot, and it led to destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called in for him: and I hastened to remove the bandage: and calmness followed, and he was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption had already become established in the limb: and I was not able to restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So then the corruption ceased to spread through the limb, until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who pierced a cancerous apostem: and it became ulcerated after days, until the evil of his lord was magnified with him.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	What is, because when there is a pure cancer from melancholic humor, then it does not seem advisable to approach it with iron at all, unless it be in a member that can tolerate it, so that the whole of it may be cut away.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of that, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, an operation associated with salvation, and an operation in which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already pointed out in every place of this book, where an operation comes up, in which there is fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that, and to moderate it: so that the stupid ones may not find a way to speak about it, and to discredit it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Receive therefore the measurement with solicitude and protection, and your infirmities with facility and firmness, and may you have a better way of proceeding by the grace of God to salvation and laudable succession: and abandon the terrible difficulties of difficult healing: and remove your souls from what makes you fear, so that hesitation may not creep over you in your faith and your comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and afterwards to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen indeed has already said so in certain of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	You do not heal the bad illness: lest you be named a bad doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On Cauterization with fire, and Cauterization with acute medicine, chaptered, and arranged from head to feet, and the forms of instruments, and the furnishings of Cauterization: and all that is necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On incision and perforation, phlebotomy and venesection, and wounds: and the extraction of arrowheads, and similar things: and the entire chapter, arranged in the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	The third chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things:  chapter, arranged from head to foot, and in the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On cauterization and branding with hot irons: and with what complexions it is suitable, and when: and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I discuss the operation with it, it is necessary that I describe the quality of its cauterizations and brandings: and in what complexions they are exhibited.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore that the discourse on the quality of cauterization by hot iron and its branding is a prolix, subtle, scientific, and hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Also, many wise men have spoken about it, and they have disagreed about it: and to me, indeed, a little from their discourses is enough, fearing prolixity.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore that cauterization is suitable universally for every complexion, which is with matter and without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter and the dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	But in the hot and dry complexions with matter, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that cauterization is beneficial in them.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite, namely that cauterization is not suitable for a illness which arises from hot and dry qualities: since the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable to be healed from a hot and dry illness with hot and dry things.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of that said: that through cauterization a remedy is made in every hot and dry affliction that occurs in human bodies; because when you examine the body of a man and its humidity, according to the complexion of fire, you find the body of a man to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I say through his discourse: because from my experiments he has already demonstrated that to me many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not proper for him to come forward with that, unless he who has already been tested and exercised in the last chapter of Cauterii's exercise, and has recognized the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of afflictions within themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their time span.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	But there is no fear from the remaining complexions over you: and especially in cold and moist afflictions.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have come to an agreement about these: and they do not disagree with Cauterius in their remedies.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And you should know, my sons, that the secret of curing through Cauterium with fire and its goodness is above Cauterium with combusting medicine: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach, unless to the member that is cauterized; and it does not harm another member joined to it, except by a small injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	However, the action of combusting medicine reaches to that which is extended from the members; and perhaps it causes an affliction to occur in the member that is difficult to heal, and perhaps it interferes.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	However, fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	For we have learned that through experience, because of the length of service and study with art, and standing upon the truth of things; and because of that I excuse myself from the length of the discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not, because it is not permitted to me in this book of mine, I would reveal to you the hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation on bodies through expulsion of their own diseases, which expels diseases by philosophical demonstration, which will be impressed upon your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And you know, my sons, that they disagree among themselves at the time when it is suitable to perform cauterization, and they set a better time for spring.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is suitable at any time; because, when a harmful accident occurs due to the season being submerged in youth, which is attracted with cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if cauterization is because of pains from necessary pains, strong, swift, which do not tolerate delay: therefore, because it is feared that a greater evil may occur, which is more than the small harm that occurs at that time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it occur to your minds, my sons, that they do not esteem, except the common and foolish physicians, namely that those diseases which are healed by cauterization, are not always a return: and they set forth that consequence, and the thing is not as they think: therefore, because cauterization is not, unless it changes the complexion, and dries out the humidities which are the causes, whence pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization is superior to medicine through the swiftness of its healing, and the virtue of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that the disease may return at some time according to the complexion of the infirm person, and the location of the disease itself, and its virtue: and what is prepared in his body through an aggregation of superfluous things in it: and what reaches him in his acquisition from foods and similar causes, unless there is a disease for which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle numbness in a few limbs that are swollen and moist, such as a burn from a tooth, due to pain, and similar to that, it is possible that the pain does not return to it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that occurs in a few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But truly the common speech is wrong, since cauterization is a last resort of medicine, and it's a correct speech: not towards that which they intend in it; because they believe that there is no cure that can be accomplished with medicine, nor with anything else after the use of cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The reality is contrary to that, and the intention, that cauterization is a last resort of medicine, is not so; unless when we administer methods of cure in some numbness, and they do not confer with those medicines: then we administer cauterization at the end, and it confers; therefore it falls, that cauterization is a last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many stupid doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients, however, said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron; and they did not say that, except because of the equality of gold, and the sublimity of its substance: and they said that it does not produce pus at the place of cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	That is not absolutely true: because I have already tested that, and found that it does not do that in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization with gold itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you heat cauterization fire in a gold fire, it is not declared to you, when it is ignited according to the quantity that you want, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches the cold, and if you add ignition on top of it, it melts in the fire and turns into plates.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore the craftsman falls from that into the occupation: and because of that, cauterization with iron is more suitable and closer to us, due to its straightforwardness in operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have already arranged this chapter on cauterization, following the chapters; and I have arranged it from head to feet, so that they may find quickly what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	On the method of cauterizing the head at the crown's commissure.
Caput II.	Head 2.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here cauterization is beneficial for mastering humidity and coldness on the brain, which are two causes of diseases, and many fluxes of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and many sleep disorders, and toothaches, and throat pains; and universally all sicknesses that occur from coldness, such as paralysis, and diseases, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar ones from those sicknesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is to prepare the patient: so that they may be evacuated in the first place with cleansing medicine, purifying the head for three nights or four, according to what the strength of the patient requires, and their age, and their habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then advise them to shave their head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands squarely, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then put the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger touches, mark that place with a cauterization.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply the cautery of olive oil: this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it over the marked spot with the cautery, descending gradually, as your hand contracts slowly, and you turn it around.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly, and inspect the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that it has already drawn out a quantity of brain marrow or a quantity of zeolite, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat with your hand in the same place, or with another from the same place if it becomes cold: until you see the bones, which I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then apply something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the same cotton, and put it on the location: and leave it there for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then put the cotton soaked in butter on it, and leave it on the location until the scab is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with four-drug ointment, until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	Some have said that when the wound remains open for a longer time, it discharges pus; therefore it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them have said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone: and the cautery should be held in place until it reaches a certain degree of hardness of the bone.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then scrape off what has been burned onto the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to reach the bone with the cautery until the end, so that it makes an impression on the bone, so that it becomes like a shell shape: or an instrument which women use for inserting small letters: and they think that vapors rise from this place to the head, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it, until it consolidates.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But to me, these two methods of cauterization do not seem useful at all, except in certain men according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it alone is better for me, with the safety of his own health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity: as we have testified to in other members: and especially when the head of the infirm person is weak by nature: and indeed the first species of cauterization is safer and better for me, and I approve it: therefore operate with it for health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	On the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Head 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs throughout the whole head, and it is prolonged in the weak, and it uses yawning, and hiccuping, and purging of the head, and anointing with oil, and applying poultices.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and nothing of those things helps it: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the weak patient is of a strong natural constitution, and it is not feeble, and it finds a violent cold: then cauterize with another cautery beneath that place a little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize him on the entire crown of his head with a cautery, so that it does not penetrate through the skin, and a quantity of bone is disclosed, as we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize him with one cautery on the back of his head, in the place that is called "uas": and it is a place where a vein is located: and elevate your material in this, and do not disclose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the weak patient finds relief from that violent pain, and is freed from the pain of the remaining cauteries of his entire head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I say that this Cautery is in its proper place: and it is necessary that there be a cautery, with which the crowns of the head are cauterized, and his back is more subtly cauterized with a cautery, with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in hemicania, both with a medicinal burnt treatment and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Head 4.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and soreness occur in part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is cleansed with purifying medications, and the remaining treatment is administered, as I said in the divisions of diseases, and it does not help entirely: then cauterization there is according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cauterization is done with acute medicine, burning as you receive one of the teeth of the other, and you excise it, and you cut off its extremities from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then, you make an incision at the place of pain at the time with a broad scalpel, until it becomes a spot beneath the skin, where the tooth is seized.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Introduce it therefore beneath the skin, until it is hidden: then bind above it with a decent constriction of poultice, and leave it for fifteen hours; then loosen it, and extract the tooth, and leave it for two days, or three. Afterwards, put above it a submerged cotym covered in butter, until the place makes pus: then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do that with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, concerning medicines that draw out.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization is indeed done with iron, according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	A fiery cauterization, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is named Clavulus; because the form of its head is like the form of a little nail, in which there is some curvature, and in its middle there is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then put it on the spot, and hold your hand firm; and you rotate the iron slowly with speed: and let the amount that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, as its middle.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand, so that the artery which is below is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the cotym in salt water, and put it on the spot, and leave it for three days: then put the cotym with butter: afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this half of the skull with the secondary edge of the scalpel's cauterization.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting into an artery in this half-cranium, not in the ancient proper way.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in the ancient half-cranium.
Caput V.	Head 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a half-cranium, with what we have said from previous cures and what we have said in divisions of illnesses, and the cure does not work: and you see from the illness that it does not suffice for him what we have said from the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, then it is necessary to apply a burning cauterization, until it becomes white after marking the place of pain with a line, whose length should be half a finger, or nearly so: and put your hand in place of one, and press it down until you cut into an artery, and penetrate to the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jawbone, which moves during mastication, lest it be dislocated, or the nerve that moves it, whence a spasm occurs.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And this is above the joint, and beware of the flow of blood from the artery, which has been cut off.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in cutting it off, there is fear, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not diligent, nor experienced: and he leaves the operation with this at the beginning.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with a reminder of the rule for controlling the flow of blood that occurs from an artery according to its own method, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	What if you see from the illness that this cauterization does not suffice for him, and you see the weak body tolerating the cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, cure the wound, until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer a cauterization, which we have said in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cauterization having two burning irons.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better and more beneficial in this case.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in painful ear infections.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain in the ear occurs from cold, and it is treated with solutives, and other treatments that we mentioned earlier, and the pain does not subside, then cauterization by fire is applied: and this is what is called a Punctum, whose shape is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the punctures are made with it around the entire ear after its ignition, as it revolves: or around both ears, if there is pain in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And stretch it out with the cauterizing iron at the root of the ear for a short time, after you have marked the places with ink: and let the quantity of the cauterization be ten punctures on each ear, or almost so.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the places until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	Concerning the method of cauterizing for tetanus.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The tetanus that is treated with cauterization is not except for those cases which occur from phlegmatic causes, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And it is necessary to apply cauterization to the type that occurs from dryness and nervous spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of tetanus with hiera, and head purging, and gargling, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient in three places: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little below the temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And apply your cauterizing iron from the opposite side of the affected part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is to cauterize it with the cauterizing iron directly on the upper extremity of the ear below the crown of the head, a little above the temple: and another on the same side, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And put your hand with a cautery until it burns to the extent of the moderate thickness of the skin.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of a Cautery, and it is a type from a small knife, whose form is previously mentioned: however it is not too subtle, as you see; and it is necessary that the small knife be above a little bit of excessive thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with what has preceded: until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in ancient Apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When ancient Apoplexy is antiquated, and you treat it with what we have said, and your medication does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and a cautery at the back of the head, according to what has preceded: and the method of the cautery should be according to what has preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	He is also cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the stomach: and it is even more extreme.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then he should be treated with what has preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Obliquity.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that the drink be given first to the sick person with great hysteria, and purifying pills for cleansing the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the whole head of the sick person, and put on his occiput a Synapic plaster described in the treatise on plasters: and put it on several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This indeed is the method of the Cautery: and do that according to the same order which I mentioned there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If he is thus healed through that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make for him three cauteries on the back of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and put a thickness of a finger between each cautery.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cauterization, with what has preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however there is an addition and he is weakened, bearing that: then make a cauterization for him in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	What if there is an addition: then cauterize it above the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat him, until he is healed: and let the cauterization be according to the second form, which has been mentioned before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.

Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary to proceed with cleansing the head with yolks of eggs, and with what we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the invalid: afterwards cauterize him with a cauterization in the middle of the head, and with a cauterization above every horn of the head, and with a cauterization above the nape of his neck, and three on the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however you find him in a severe softening of the body from many of those, and he is weakened, bearing that, and the disease is strong: then cauterize him with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cauterization, until it burns deeply into his skin, and lift your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then treat him, until he is healed: and thus the cauterization is to be made with olive oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	The epileptic is not to be cauterized, unless it is he whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	It is necessary therefore to cleanse his brain first with yolks of eggs, and with the remaining treatment which we mentioned earlier: when he is greatly weakened, or bears it in the acceptance of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If however he is a boy who does not tolerate medicines, then let him be given gargles and cleansing mastications for the brain, before that for many days with a blessing of foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave the top of his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what has been described previously; and with another cautery on its occiput, and over the entire horn-shaped part of his head with a cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	What if the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I mentioned in the case of one having paralysis, and mollification of the body on the vertebrae of the neck, and the vertebrae of the back; and let the cautery be oily according to the method that has been described previously.

Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that we mentioned in the case of one having paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an abundance of fluids inclined towards melancholy, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what has been described previously in the division: then shave the head of the patient, and afterwards make a well-made tortellum from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then put it on the middle of his head: and let the patient, sitting squarely, be held firmly from all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is more worthy to use old butter or ancient oil.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over a fire with a tempered measure of heat, which the finger can tolerate, when it is inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then evacuate it on the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do that to the patient every week once, with the rest of his good regime, until he is healed.

Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the principle of water in the eye is declared to you through signs, which I mentioned in the division, then begin and cleanse the weak part, together with what purifies his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep it away from all moistures, and make him sit in a bath, on fasting days for some time.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then instruct him to shave his head, and to cauterize it in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him above the two temples with two cauteries, if there is a downward flow of water in both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if there is a flow of water in one eye: and cut off all the veins and arteries that are beneath the skin with the cautery: and let the cauteries be long in width across the temples: and beware of a flux of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything coming out of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I warn with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting off, and caution against a flux of blood.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in old tears.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old and frequent: and they are above the veins and arteries that are on the outer surface of the head, it is verified that it is from cold and phlegmatic superfluities: then cauterize with the cautery which I described in the flow of descending water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck beneath the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you notice an excess, then cauterize it on every side of the eye, above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	On the method of cauterizing in the nasal fossa.

Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it, with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then prepare, and give a potion of three nights to the weak-sighted; afterwards shave their head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an oily cautery.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with two nail-shaped cauterizers, above the two eyebrows, beneath the hair, a little.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	On the method of cauterizing in the relaxation of the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye is relaxed from sickness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunar-shaped cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on every side; and they will be lengthened from two temporal areas; and let the entire length of the cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not finally move your hand with the cautery, but rather according to the quantity that touches the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the shape of a cautery according to this method of a lunar-shaped cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the method of cauterizing an eyelid when hairs are embedded that pierce the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery is of two kinds: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	With the cautery of fire, warn the weak patient beforehand, so that they may release their hairs, if they are among those who clean them, until they grow long and equal.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If they sting him at his own door, then bind his eyes with a cloth, so that they do not move until they are fully opened.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they have opened and are equalized, then place the head of the afflicted one in your lap; afterwards, mark above his eyelids with a cautery, marking what is according to the shape of the myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then put a bandage soaked in white egg or in a mucilage of psyllium over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply a cautery of fire, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the shape that you marked gradually in many places, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the shape of the myrtle leaf, making it appear properly whole.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is this: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted, and the hairs lifted up at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Lift your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then put a bandage with butter on it, until the scab is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If something returns from the hairs after that hour and the eyelid becomes soft, then apply the cautery again to that place, just as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If the hairs are below, then cauterize them, until they lift up to their natural place: and equalize them so that they do not sting the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	Concerning the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in this same case.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is as if you instruct the afflicted one to let the hairs grow, until they lengthen and equalize.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a shape of the myrtle leaf from a paper template.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap and from unsoaked lime a pound and a half or nearly that amount; then grind those things together with good contraction, and make it with thorough mixing, so that it is not frozen.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then take from the pan the same amount that you made into a shape like a myrtle leaf, and put it on the eyelid of one eye or of two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And put under the eye a small piece of cloth soaked in white egg, and let the head of the injured person be in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And put your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently for a while.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you move it around whenever the injured person feels the biting of the medicine, because he finds its biting like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore it perseveres this which he himself has found the biting, then remove the medicine, and move it around with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting subsides, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid being elevated, as it is elevated by contraction with fire or with incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat over the same place from the medicine, where the medicine does not impress, and does not stain, until your operation is equalized, and the eye is contracted.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then put over it a small piece of cloth with butter, until the skin is freed from burning.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a diaphenic ointment or another, until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during the operation to keep a final guard, lest something from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid becomes soft after a few days, and something struggles from the hairs into the eye, then repeat the medicine over that place which becomes soft from the eyelid itself, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of myrtle leaves.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And you should know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be: and the way of righteousness is not hidden from him who has a zeal for this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	On the method of cautery on the tear duct fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat the fistula, with that which we mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not help: then, it is necessary to cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Order the patient to put his head on your lap, and let his servant hold his head between their hands in such a way that it is not moved or stirred with his own head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then put a cloth soaked in egg white or a poultice of powdered psyllium over his eye: then ignite the cautery iron, whose form is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	It should be a concave shape, like the form of a feather's quill from one extremity, with which the cautery is made: and if you wish it to penetrate up to the other extremity, and if you wish it to be bent upwards in this way.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave shape is better suited for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then squeeze out the fistula, if it is open, and extract from it the sanious matter, and cleanse it: and if it is not open, then open it, and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then put the cautery iron, which has been ignited strongly, on top of it.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand with it for a short time near the cautery iron, away from the eye, towards the nose, so that your hand does not tremble or disturb the patient: and you will put the cautery iron in the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If you therefore penetrate at the beginning of the cauterization up to the bone, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization once or twice, if it is necessary for that; and let it be left for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then put a dressing with butter, and take care of it with a stimulating ointment, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If it has passed forty days and it does not heal: then put on top of it a sharp corroding medicine, until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what is written in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some first authorities have mentioned.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Direct yourself to the place of the fistula and find it; then put into that fissure a subtle cannula, whose shape is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of drachmae from liquefied lead, and hold your hand with good cannula retention, and do not move the weak one at all, so that it does not flow, or the liquefied lead reaches its eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary to put on the weak eye a dressing soaked in white egg, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For the lead indeed burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed, along with what we have said about cauterization and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nasal passage, and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what is suitable for its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	On the method of cauterizing in labial fissures.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Fissures often occur on the lip, which are called Pili, and especially on the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When you treat these fissures, with what we have said in the division of diseases, and treatment does not help, then make a small cautery iron in the shape of a scalpel.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let its concavity be according to the subtlety of the scalpel.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place it ignited hastily in those fissures, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a poultice, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	On the method of cauterizing a fistula of the mouth.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus, and bursts forth: afterwards it becomes chronic, and a flow of pus ensues, and a fistula forms: then you should treat it, and if it does not respond to treatment, it is necessary to apply a cautery according to its size, which should encompass the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the ignited iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand steady, until the ignited iron reaches the depth of it and its extremity: do that once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterwards with what we have said about treatment, until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the pus is cut off and heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to lay bare the location, and to remove the corrupted bone according to what appears in its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	On the method of cauterizing swollen gums and teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gums are swollen due to moisture, and the teeth are loose, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not respond: then place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then prepare a cautery, whose form will appear afterwards, so that you place a tube over the tooth: and insert the ignited cautery hastily into it: and hold your hand steady for a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire having reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And elevate your hand: then again Cauterium several times, according to what you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then the weak member soaks its bone in salt water, and holds it for one hour: and extracts it.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the movement is strengthened, and the gum softened by the string is tightened, and the corrupted humidity is dried.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	On the method of cauterizing painful teeth.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is due to coldness, either the cold is in it or worm, and treatment with medicines does not help: then Cautery is applied to it in two ways: either Cautery with butter or Cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The Cautery with butter is however, that you take clarified butter, and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a vase.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take cotton, and apply it to the extremity of the tooth.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then submerge it in the boiled butter: and place it quickly on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools down: then repeat it several times, until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, submerge wool, or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the painful tooth: and place ignited iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the depth of the tooth's concavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The Cautery with fire is however, that you direct it to a copper tube, or an iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be in its body some thickness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the weak mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then apply the fire Cautery, whose form appears: and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand until the Cautery cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do that several times, for the pain is removed, either on that same day, or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary in the impression of that cautery, to fill the weakened bone with good pus, and to hold it for one hour; then to evacuate it.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with a hot iron on whatever extremity you use, according to what is possible; and this is the form of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	On the method of cautery in Scrofula.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When Scrofula are from phlegm, and from cold humidities, and are not obedient to digestion through medicines, and you wish to hasten their digestion: then apply a concave cautery fire, whose form is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	It has two open extremities, so that the smoke may emerge from the cautery at the other extremity: and place it ignited upon the aposteme once, and a second time, if it is necessary, until it reaches the depth of the aposteme.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the aposteme is small: then place the cautery according to the quantity of the aposteme.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a cloth infused with butter, until what was burned by the fire is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with a denti's ointment, until the form of the cannula heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	On the method of cautery on a hoarse voice and constricted breathing.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When humidities overcome the pulmonary canal, and especially when it is with a cold complexion, then it is necessary to evacuate the weakened area first with dissolving medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cautery it at night beside the root of the throat in a depressed place: and beware, lest you penetrate with the cautery to the throat, or in the skin, unless something of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cautery it with another cautery at the joint of the neck in its last vertebra: and let the cautery be a moderate one according to the method that preceded.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with what came before until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of lung inflammation and cough.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When cough and lung inflammation are caused by cold humidities, and the patient is not feverish, nor consumptive, and the illness is not chronic: then cauterize him with two cauterizations above the ankle in depressed, slack, and empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And cauterize with another on the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cauterization be according to the shape of the tube which came before.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish to cauterize by pricking with the cauterization tool, which is called a Point, whose shape came before in the pricking of the pain of the ears: and let there be points from thirty points up to almost sixty.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with what came before until he is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cauterization instrument have three branches: according to this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Because it is alleviated with that cauterization when you make it into one of the three Cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	On the method of cauterizing for a displaced shoulder, in the case of dislocation of the humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the joint is dislocated due to humid causes, and it does not return to its place at once after its dislocation, until it becomes accustomed to returning to its own location, then it is dislocated by a small motion, which occurs as we have already demonstrated, then you should reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient should be placed on his back or on his healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then elevate the skin which is on the inside of the shoulder to the top with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inward.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then apply a cauterization instrument having two rods.
Cuius forma est haec.	This form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the wound, until it penetrates to another side, and there will be a figure of cauterization with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And when a cauterization is made with a cautery having three arms, then the figure of cauterization will be of six cauteries; and they are arms according to the subtlety of the tension.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of a cautery having three arms.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And when one is added in this way, then there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then put rough salt on the cautery that has been contracted.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the weak part adhere to tranquility, so that the limb is not moved for some time, until it is comforted.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is towards the upper parts, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a cautery of claws, or with multiple points.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the weak part is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	On the method of cauterizing the Stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and many humidities accumulate in the Stomach, until they extract it from its natural complexion, and multiply the fluxes to it, and assiduous methods of cure do not help: then it is necessary that the weak part be supported on its back, and stretch out its legs, and hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the spoon-shaped part of the chest in the quantity of one finger, and two cauteries below from the two sides of the cautery, until there appears a triangular figure of cauteries.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And stretch out between both, so that they do not join together, when they make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be the quantity of two thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the figure of cauteries be according to this form without addition; and if you wish to cauterize with a large cauterizing instrument in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and let the cauterizing instrument be one according to the circular figure according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by pricking him who is terrified by this cautery; and it is, as you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity that you wish with an encaustic; then cauterize it with the cautery of the point; then cure it with the treatment that precedes until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold Epiploic (fatty) appendix.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When there is pain in the liver due to coldness and humidity, or due to coarse flatulence, until it departs from its natural passage and the sick person becomes weak, as we have said, and does not benefit from it: then it is necessary for the sick person to be placed on their back, and marked with three cauteries according to this figure, and in the same quantity on the lower liver below the ribs, where the elbow of a man reaches; and let there be space between each cauterization according to the thickness of the finger: and let the cauterizing instrument be straight according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand too much with the cauterizing instrument.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of it that is touched be according to the thickness of the skin, a moderate quantity not added; and let the sick person stand on their own feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if they are not standing, then let them lie down, who has already stretched out their legs and raised their arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the shape of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize with this cautery using a knife-shaped cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And beware lest you proceed to the extreme in cauterization, and the hardness of the entire skin is scorched, because it scorches the entire body, and reaches to the intestines; for the skin there is subtle, so know that.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the method of cauterizing apostemes of the liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an aposteme occurs, and you want to know if that aposteme is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, it produces a dull pain and heaviness without acuteness: and if it is in the membrane of the liver, with pain there is vehement acuteness: and you see already, because it has exhausted the doctors with its treatment.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is necessary therefore that the weak person takes a rest on his couch.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then mark out the place of the aposteme with encaustic: then apply a cautery that is similar to a star.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with one cautery until the entire skin is burned, and reaches to the vitellus, until all the sanies are discharged: then take care of the same curation of apostemes, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not fitting that one uses this type of cautery, unless one whose study in the medical art is prolonged: and through whose hands these diseases converge with some experimentation many times: then indeed he dares to undertake such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But truly to omit it, it is better in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of Pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that a cautery with the roots of Aristolochia is beneficial for cold Pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you take from the dry roots of Aristolochia a root, one longer than the others, which is found to be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then submerge it in oil and set it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with a single cauterization at the point where the gullet meets the neck, and with two small cauteries under the guidance of small inclinations towards the part that is beneath the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also at the point that is between the fifth and sixth ribs, inclining towards the back a little; and with one cauterization in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from the back: one at the point that is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries on both sides of the chest, the lower cauterization being between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary to compress your hand with the cauterization, but rather let it be on the manifest skin, emitting an odour.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And now certain ancients have said that there are those who use cauterization with an iron instrument similar to a rod; and they ignite it, and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the aposteme itself, and the sanies flow out: as we have described in the case of Epatis' aposteme.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with a cauterization there is fear, lest the weak patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs at that place, which has no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	On the method of cauterizing the Spleen, Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat an illness of the spleen, with what we have said about cures in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not work, then cauterization is used in three ways, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is to make three or four cauteries in a line along the length of the spleen, according to the figure of the cauteries of Epatis, whose figure has preceded.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between each cauterization a quantity of thickness equal to that of a finger, or a little more.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And this is the method of cautery, which we have described in the cautery of the liver, done equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie down on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauteration is: to hold the two-pronged cautery, which we have described in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and elevate the skin, which is on the direct splenetic line, where the cubit of the left arm reaches; and let your elevation be such that you elevate the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce the two-pronged ignited cautery, until you penetrate the skin on the other side: then withdraw the cautery: thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with a cautery having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care to apply the cautery after you have released it, to bring forth pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than the rest that preceded in the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall in Dropsy, unless applied precisely.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a Dropsical patient with the methods of cure that we have described in the division, and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery above the stomach, and another above the liver, and one on the spleen, and two on the back between the vertebrae, and one on the direct line of the chest, and another on the direct line of the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the open cautery, so that it brings forth pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not evacuate the patient from the cure after the cautery with it: for it is necessary that two intentions are added to him: and he will be hastened to his healing with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery iron with which the belly is cauterized should be club-shaped: according to the preceding shape of it; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped according to the preceding shape of it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they swell with hydroptic dropsy and are filled with citrine water: it is necessary to cauterize on the upper part of the foot at night, which is between the anklebone and the ring finger; and raise your hand with the cautery iron, and do not twist it; then raise your hand, and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the citrine water flows back, and the cautery iron should be according to this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery iron be at the end of the knife-shaped cautery; and let it be according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another lower than that, around the middle of the leg; and above all the hip, two cauteries; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time: so that some water may flow out from it; then treat it with the rest as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in the case of a ruptured belly.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a rupture of the belly due to cold and humidity, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with methods of treatment, but not healed; and you see an infirm person tolerating a cautery of overflowing virtue, then cauterize it with a large cautery iron on their belly, according to what precedes in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery iron, and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a club-shaped subtle cautery; and with a cautery above the groins above the hips with a large one, or with two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moistness, and the weak patient tolerates that, then cauterize it with a cautery on the pubic area, and cauterize all of that with a cautery: and perhaps add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	It is a profitable treatment, whose benefit does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are old and numerous hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from gross, cold, or corrupt humors, and are treated with what we said earlier, but the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower vertebra of the back below the waist, almost triangularly, and with a cautery near the navel, about two fingers wide.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food does not digest, and you see his face affected with aposteme, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what has been said before: and with a cautery on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a cautery of the claws: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing ulcers after their surgical removal.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you have surgically removed the ulcers, then apply a fiery cautery that is similar to a spark.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the ignited cautery into the surgically removed ulcer: and ultimately with your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein, from which the blood flows: do it once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If there are many ulcers, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what is beneficial to them from ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on the shoulder blade, it is more effective in the joint.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not obey the treatment and operation that we have described in its proper place, and is troubled by it, perhaps he may be healed with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula happens to someone, and it becomes chronic, pus flows out of it, and the corrupted moisture ferments.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is more dignified therefore that what is fitting should be done, so that you may probe it with a subtle probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the quantity of its depth with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply a cautery, which is similar to a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the ignited cautery itself into the fistula and the quantity where the nail went in.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat over it the cautery, until all the corrupted bodily parts are burned away, once, or twice, or three times, according to the quantity of your necessary treatment.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And be cautious of the nerve's burning, if it is there, or of the great veins; or if the fistula reaches to the bladder or to the intestine, then beware of all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do that unless the fistula is in a fleshy place; and consider that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If however the place is sealed, and the materials are cut off from it, and it remains so for a long time; then know that it has already been fully healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the materials do not cut off from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupted opening deep within it, or something like that among them; whose reminder will come in its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterizing Kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or excessive flatulence, and it is diminished because of that weak condition, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the loins, to cauterize each kidney with a cautery claw, whose preceding memory.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we should cauterize it secondly in that very loin itself.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Because three lines are drawn.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be more effective in the treatment.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness occurs in the bladder due to cold and humidity, until it does not retain the urine of the weak person, then cauterize it on the lower part of the back above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin, and with a cautery from the right side of the back, and another from the left side: and let the length of that cautery be according to the size of the knot of the thumb: and cauterize it with a lower dorsal cautery, or with two cauteries if needed, and let it be according to what precedes the claw-like cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and humidity occur in the womb, and it is prevented by that from becoming pregnant, and its menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs to her upon their arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the claw-like cautery be used.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing the ankle in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When mucous humidity flows to the hollow of the ankle, and becomes the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that the leg is prolonged above the other when they are compared to each other: and the location of the dislocation is found empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the weak area above the ankle with a cautery similar to the circle of the ankle; after you mark out the circumference of the ankle with an encaustic, as it revolves: and so that the very pixy falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the form which has preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	What if this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large oily cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Concerning the method of cauterizing for sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the ankle, and the causes of it are cold and moisture: and the weak area is treated with what we mentioned earlier, and treatment does not help, and it gets worse: then it is necessary to free the weak area from thick humors with foul-smelling poultices, or with artificial poultices, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cautery for it is according to two modes: either cautery with adhering medications, or cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is to cauterize above the ankle with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make their depth good or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space that is between each cautery be of the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be oily.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When, however, a cautery is made in the middle above the head of the ankle itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Because there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, whose form has preceded in the cauterization of dislocation of the ankle, one: so that it is a circle containing the entire ankle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the whole skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in sciatica, when the pain adheres to the anchaea itself and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the hip, above the place where the pain is, in which there is pain, and with your cautery on the neck of the thigh four fingers' width towards the wooded part for a short time: and let the cautery be a knife-shaped one.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	What if the pain indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where it indicates with a cautery of one point, three points, or four points, or more, if it needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if it indicates that the pain is beneath the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with a single knife-shaped cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And be careful in all your cauterizations, so that you do not ultimately harm with the cautery to the point of burning a nerve or a large artery, and attracting through it a serious bad injury or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have indeed already seen one or another among those who cauterized above the thigh and ultimately harmed in the cauterization, and the leg became inflamed, until a tumor followed to the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted: then afterwards there occurred a discharge of pus, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	What if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men have said that in cauterizing the anchaea, whose method of cautery is this.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar iron instrument, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its orifice according to the thickness of the core of the finger, or slightly less: and within that instrument let there be a third instrument.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be a space that is between all the veins by the quantity of the node of the thumb; and let the veins be opened from two parts; and let their height be like a knot, or two knots; and make for them a handle from iron, decently adapted in the veins.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is heated in the fire until it becomes red-hot and shoots out sparks; then it is placed on a pillow or cushion with an injured limb resting on a healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Burn him therefore with three rounded cauteries in one vein.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it alone for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards, apply a plaster with butter; and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis said, "We have used this type of cautery little, on account of the terror of its appearance; and for this reason, we have found few who dare to try it out.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is one of the good cauteries for him who endures it, and finds its place with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cautery, however, is with medicines that are suitable, so that you make two veins having a perforated armlet, in which descends the hinge of its gate made of copper or iron, with a length equal to the wall; of which there should be two knots, or almost like them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be a space that is between the two quantities of the thickness of the finger, and let them be open above and below; and let it be what contains itself according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on a pillow or cushion with the injured limb lying on a healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand strongly on the pillow or cushion.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of hot water, which has been warmed with fire for a short time, and hold it for the duration of an hour; and let the injured person tolerate its bite and his own burning, for he finds the biting as fire, until the biting ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then wash your hand with a instrument and remove warm water from the entire limb with sweet water; then let it sit for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter on it, until the blackness of the burn is removed; and let it sit for several days, and then clean out the pus from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the last stage of the treatment.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a plaster for it with water, according to what you did equally on the limb.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of warm water; and I have already written about it in the treatise on medicinal rectifications.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkaline and non-extinguished lime of each one part: grind both, and put them in a new pot, whose lower part is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that can be poured in as a radius; and place beneath the base of the pot another pot, treated thus: and pour over the alkaline and lime from sweet water, which submerges both by a finger's width; then compress it with your hand with good pressure: and let the pot sit, until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the treated pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all that water, and pour it over another lime; and strain, until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For that will be a strong sharpness then, which is administered in many medical operations and in the cauterization of remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And they are among the medicines, with which limbs are cauterized, also like tetany, and honey of apricot, and lime with soap, so that both may be thoroughly mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed reported that a certain man from the ancients was cured by a treatment, by which he was healed of pain in his limb and sciatic vein; and he magnified its effectiveness greatly.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that he did not need another treatment, and that he was healed from one vein, since it had been restored, because perhaps he himself had inserted a blocked bath, and had gone out already healed from it.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, that he should be treated with a green poultice: and if a green one is not found, a dry fresh one should be applied; and it should be repeated many times with some fat, and placed on the affected area, where there is pain, or in the leg, or in the hip: and it should be bound, and left for three hours, or for as long as he feels the relief of the burning sensation.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him to a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes very cold, introduce him to the sun.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain subsides, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not fitting to use any cautery with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides, who said that the dung of goats, when with it a vein is cauterized for sciatica, helps him; and it becomes a cautery according to this method.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let wool be applied, and it be soaked in old oil, and placed on the deep area which is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle, and is closest to the ankle.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung, and set it on fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not cease to do that, until the sensation reaches the ankle through the middle, and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called Cautery of Goat's Dung.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Of the cautery for pain in the back.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 43.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, from an infusion of cold and humid matter; and indeed cautery does not fail, except in this one species alone, which is caused by an infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after evacuation of the patient with foul suppurating sores and similar ones, three lines according to the width of the ulcer itself should be made on the back where the pain is, after marking with ink in each line five cauteries or more according to the amount that comes from the tolerance of the patient's strength; and cauterization should be done with caution punctures.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries or four, with a medial cautery claw, according to this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing on the gibbosity of the navel.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of this illness in children is that it occurs with a constriction in the breathing upon elevation, and movement; and you will find it in the last vertebra of the back and its nodes, which already begin to emerge above the remaining vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you see that and want to do it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular in shape according to this method.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery grasp equally over every part of the vertebrae; and if you want to cauterize around the vertebrae with a point-cautery, make two lines or three, and let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you administer the cautery to the gibbosity, which is caused by a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing for gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are caused by cold humidities that flow to whatever members of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is customary for doctors to call it Gout specifically.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	Since the treatment of cold gouty causes with methods of cure does not remove the pains, then cauterization removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, as he is cauterized after evacuating the surrounding joint of the foot with many cauteries; and let the cautery be oily.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make points on the surface of the foot, then make them with a cautery point.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	What if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and it often happens that, then cauterize it on every knee with three cauteries, or four from each part, with the same cautery of Clavus.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If however more are needed for you with this cautery, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be around the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If however the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we said from the cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	What if the pains are only in the hands, then make points around the joints of the fingers, as two lines encircle.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If however some pain remains in the toes, then make points on every node of a toe, and on the heel of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If however the pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the weak patient from good regimen, from receiving medications.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is done, and the phlegm is evacuated, he will be healed with the help of God along with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in hernias.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a hernia occurs in the groin, and the intestine descends, or the scrotum to the testicle, and it is beginning to be near: then it is necessary that you should advise the patient to omit digestion on his day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let it be opened gently, so that pus descends from its own belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then place it between your hands on its back, and instruct it to hold its breath until it goes out, or shows a bubble, or intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark it with a branding iron under the fracture on the bone of the chest, with a mark whose extremity is similar to the middle of a circle at the upper body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply a branding iron, which has this shape, until it produces a white spot, and pushes out the tiny fragments.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or bubble, to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then the assistant should place their hand on the spot, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have now opened between the thighs of the patient, and placed a pillow under them, and one servant is above their thighs, and another above their chest who holds their hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the branding iron on the spot, with your hand holding the branding iron straight and steady.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it, until you reach the bone: or try again with another vice, if you have not succeeded with it at first until you reach the bone.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe the intestine's exit during your branding operation, lest you burn it, and it becomes a fatal wound to the patient, or a great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach the bone with the branding iron, your operation is of no use.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary for the branding iron to be subtle and adapted to the size of the children.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the remaining ointments, until they are healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary to put his nourishment in accordance with the length of time of his cure, so that it soothes his belly: lest the intestine comes out through straining and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when you want to operate after forty days, then administer a bandage made in the meantime, and keep it for forty days more.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him be at rest from labor, and replenished with food and drink, and relieved of violent evacuations.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, he will be healed with a complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will describe the treatment of hernias with an incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When hernias occur in the rest of the abdomen, and are beginning, and it seems as though they do not add, then cauterize that hernia with a round cauterization according to its quantity: and let what is touched be one-third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat it, with what we have said: and do not add to it.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some of the first ones have said: that a hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cauterization, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with encaustic, and a line is placed which is along the width on the upper side of the hernia, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a clave-shaped cauterization.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cauterization is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in pains due to a fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in certain members due to a fall or blow, and the pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize with a punctured cauterization.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cauterization of each member be according to its magnitude, and its own smallness, and its weakness, and its own strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore he is healed by the first cauterization, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then apply a cautery upon it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Since it is customary to transfer these pains from the affected member to that which approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary to follow them with a cautery until the afflicted part is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But lepers are sometimes helped by a cautery with the greatest benefit.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy that occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy; therefore, when you want to cauterize it, consider its nature.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If the leprosy is incurable and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the division, and it does not recede, nor does it stand still: and it spreads over the whole complexion of the patient: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one on the middle of the head at the crown, and a second below that towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two on the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally, apply your hand with the cautery for a short time, until it impresses a small impression on the mouth, and the cortices are dislocated from it: so that the expiration of gross vapors is alleviated from it, and cauterize also over the spleen itself, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and appears manifestly, then it is necessary to cauterize with those cauteries which we mentioned on the head, and with a cautery on the extremity of the nose, and two cauteries on the two jaws, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one at the base of the tail and one above it, in that very place; and two on the hip: namely, one on each hip, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the elbows, and two on the cubits, and two on the tenderness of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his fingers and toes; and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and on the metacarpals of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And be cautious of the nerves that are above the heel bone, so you do not injure them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when a branding iron is applied to the bone of the pubic area, and another to the bone of the stomach, and another to the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add branding iron, it is the greater harm, and the more it causes damage.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the weak person does not feel pain from branding iron, as the healthy ones do: therefore, because their body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the branding irons be of a magnitude, and smaller according to the members and joints: according to what precedes from the species of iron instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the branding iron with flour of herbs mixed with honey, and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	Concerning the method of branding in numbness.
Caput L.	Chapter 50.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a limb is numb and is treated with medicines, and oils, and poultices, and it does not heal, then brand the numbed limb with branding irons, according to what the magnitude of the limb deserves, or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your branding iron be slightly more penetrating into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when branding is applied to a certain numbness that occurs in the hand or foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves, which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But it does not work on that, unless one is skilled in the anatomy of limbs and the exit of moving nerves from the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	Concerning the method of branding in Wounds.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When a wound is old and does not respond to any treatment from the ingenuity of medicine: then brand on it with a deep branding iron, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the flour of a herb, and with lentils with rose oil, and with leaves of arnoglossa, and with pigeon's blood, and with hyrundine's blood: one part from each: mix all these, and spread on a cloth, and adhere to the place until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	About the method of cauterizing in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When the cancer is beginning and you wish to restrain it: then cauterize it with a circular cauterization around its circumference, as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	The wise men have said that it should be cauterized with the final cauterization in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But it does not seem to me: because I fear that it would become an ulcer; and I have already seen that many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we said; or with multiple cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	About the method of cauterizing in Ulceration.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an ulceration and it is delayed in maturation, either because of the excess matter that produces it, or because of the age of the weak patient, when there is a lack of blood, or because of the time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the ulceration, then cauterize around its circumference with many small points, puncturing with multiple cauterizations.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let it be.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten the maturation itself.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If you wish to make a perforation of it with a cauterization, then ignite the fire of the cauterization, whose form is this.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the ulceration until it penetrates to the skin: and let the cauterization be from what follows, so that the flow of pus may be alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	About the method of cauterizing in corroding evil.
Caput LIIII.	Head 54.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	It is not a corrosive unless it is a decay in a walking limb, and it devours it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then apply many small and large cauteries with fire, according to what is convenient for that place where the corrosive is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it on every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains deeply.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and apply sulfur powder mixed with oil to the cauterized places, until all scabs are eradicated, and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And a corrosive is treated with acute medicine whenever it is necessary.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	It itself rises up in the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, a cautery with fire is of quicker help; and I have already mentioned its cauteration with acute medicine in the division: therefore take it then when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cauterizing in nails and warts.
Caput LV.	Head 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	It often happens that this disease occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filthy thing that hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed, cautery on them is according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for the cautery with fire, it is like a hollow cautery iron shaped like a bird's feather: which is made from iron, according to the quantity that contains a nail on every side: and let its edge be subtle.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then put it, ignited, on a nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then wrap the hand with a cauterizing iron around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail; and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply a poultice made with forest herbs, mixed with salt; and leave the poultice on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with a flesh-producing ointment, until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not converted, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then administer to them cautery with hot water: and it is, that you take a tube made of copper, or iron, or from the quill of a bird: and place it on the nail, or the flesh around it.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube: hold your hand, and wrap it with pressure from your hand for a short time, so that the mark of the tube is imprinted on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and wait a little while over the bite of the hot water for an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it, for the nail is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do it thus to each one after another, until you are free from all of them that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they are eradicated, with what generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the method of cautery for tremors.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When a tremor occurs from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or from something else: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries, or five on the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on its chest with a cautery, and on its stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	The trembling indeed ceases with the cautery of olive oil, and a healthy recovery is hastened from a cold disease.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cautery according to Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When there are formed on the body of Albathir's foul abscesses, that is, pustules, which come from corrupted gross materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is necessary, therefore, first of all, when they appear, to apply a subtle cautery with a burning stick of myrtle wood to every pustule on the head.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentricular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized to the point of induration, at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner: and they do not increase: and the excess is dispersed, making them healthy, and they are healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that it be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the method of cautery for a flow of blood from an artery in a vein.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that there is a flow of blood from an artery, which has been cut near the vein, whether it occurs externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or the cautery of a limb, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When it happens to someone in that way, then quickly put your hand over the orifice of the artery, and place your index finger on it: and press it strongly, until the blood is obstructed under your finger, and nothing comes out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put small olive oil cauteries on the fire, and a large number of them: and blow on them, until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, or a small one, or a large one, according to the vein and place where the artery is disrupted, and apply the cautery to the vein itself, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled with elevated fingers from the orifice of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery, which has been prepared in the fire, quickly.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore, do not cease to make that with one after another, until the blood is staunched.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and a worse evil falls upon the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to stanch it: especially since the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, the extremities of the artery contract, and the blood is staunched.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong thread of ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or medicines of suitable properties are applied to it, which are for staunching blood, and are bound with a decent poultice of constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever administers the staunching of it with a ligature, and a binding with cloth, or a positioning of burning remedies, and similar things, does not confer a complete cure to him, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If it happens to anyone in that way, and there is no present doctor, nor medicine: then let him begin with the positioning of the index finger on the orifice of the vein itself, as we have narrated, and a strong constriction, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger is not removed, but instead remains on it with vehemently cold water, always, until the blood congeals, and coagulates, and is staunched.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, let him consider in that, what he needs from a cautery or from medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incisions, Perforations, and Bloodletting for Wounds, and Similar Things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We will discuss in the First Chapter all kinds of diseases for which it is suitable to use fire-cautery and burning medicine, and their occasions, their causes, and instruments, and forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed chapters on the vertebrae up to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter by the same method: to alleviate the sufferings of the sufferer.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn, oh sons, what is in this chapter, which is about the terror of that which is in the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that, it is necessary to be more cautious, since in the operation which is in this chapter, often evacuation with blood occurs, on which life depends at the opening of a vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of an exit, or curing of a wound, or extraction of a arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which tremble, fear, and death often occur in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest it falls upon you that which is hesitation, for when they fall to you in this art of men with modes of infirmities.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For there is one who becomes angry with his own disease, and death is light to him: because of the violence of that which he finds from his own infirmity and the length of his evil.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And the disease is from fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And there is one who gives his own physician, and says to you with him, hoping for health, and his disease is pernicious.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not necessary to consent to him who comes to you from those, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let our caution be greater than our desire and our own grasping avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And let us not presume upon anything from that unless after certain knowledge, which verifies with us what has been attained through successful experience.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And let us use judgment in the treatment of all our patients, in prognosis and indication to that which may conveniently be their salvation.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in it lies your help towards acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with His intellect, and may He not deprive you of direction and inspiration; for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have indeed arranged this Chapter by distinguishing it into sections, according to what preceded in the Chapter of Cauterii, from the head to the feet: so that you may be alleviated of what you wish from it, and of what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the treatment of Water that accumulates on the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this illness often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightly grips the child's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And it sometimes happens also from a hidden cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have indeed not seen this illness in others than in children: and to all whom I saw among them, death hastened; therefore it seemed to me that it was necessary to abandon the operation in these.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have indeed seen among them a child whose head was filled with water, and the head was enlarged every day, until he could not sit up by himself, due to the greatness of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed collects either between the skin and bone, or it collects beneath the bone above the skull.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that case, if there is humidity between the skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a fissure in the middle of the head, about two inches in length, until the humidity flows out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a spatula-like instrument.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the humidity is greatly increased and the abscess is larger, then make two fissures, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the humidity is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the commissures of the head open on all sides; and the water is pressed out when you press it with your hand inwardly, and it does not remain hidden from you: then it is necessary to make three fissures in the middle of the head, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract the entire humidity.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then close the fissures with bandages and poultices.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then apply a compress of wine and oil to it, until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then remove the bandage, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not allow the head to be bound tightly.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And give the patient light food with little humidity, until the member is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider where the greatness of the abscess appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Since sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Ascend therefore with the incision where you see the abscess and the collection of water, and divide it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And take care not to cut the artery, and a flow of blood occurs, and the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of humidity.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Head 2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When some flux falls onto the eyes or chest, and it becomes chronic, and medical treatments do not help: then the last resort is to cut into those two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary, therefore, when you want to make an incision in them, that a weak head should be shaved.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries may appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the weak person should constrict their neck with any cloth of theirs.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein pulses.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And both places are located behind the ears, depressed areas; and they are rarely hidden, unless in certain individuals.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with a branding iron on both sides; and make an incision on each side with a three-edged scalpel, making the incision up to the bone: and let it be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it upwards with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be about two fingers' width joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood flows out in a pulsating flow, which jumps inward with frequent leaps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear the quantity of a three-finger space.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with a branding iron, and find your way up to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what is necessary to emit from the blood is six ounces, or perhaps more or less will be emitted from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All that according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the weak person and the replenishment of their artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the ulcer.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if something remains to the bone from the abscess, then cut into it, so that a hot aposteme does not occur: then constrict the ulcer with a linen bandage.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the removal of arteries that are in the temples.
Caput III.	Head 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When an old hemicrania afflicts a person, or acute catarrh due to acidic and salty humidities, and heat in the temples, or an old soda, which is vehement, and similar things: and they are treated with the methods of medical cure, but it does not help: then we have recourse to extracting the arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operating in extracting them is to shave the weak hairs that are in the temples, and to make an incision towards the apparent artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	It is shown to you by its own pulse, and is rarely hidden unless in a few men, or due to the vehemence of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then he should tightly bind his weak head with any cloth of his; then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or warm the place with hot water, until it appears to you in a clear manifestation.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula that I formed a little while before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape with it the skin with ease, until you penetrate to the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert a hook into it, and draw it upwards, until you extract it from the skin, and make it emerge from the tunics that are under it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is fine: then envelop it with the extremity of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it a part according to the quantity by which its extremities are lengthened, and contracted, so that there is no flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not separated, the blood does not ascend deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate from the blood about six ounces, until there are three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it off in two places with double thread, strongly, from silk or from Al-ḥod chord, so that putrefaction does not occur at the wound before consolidation, and a flow of blood happens.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess, which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a cautery knife: until the extremities of it are cut away, and it stands firm in its place of operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better work, unless the patient has a fever, or is of a hot constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cautery is one of those things that help to end humidity.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with old cotton: and that pieces of lint, decently made, be put over it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the wound is cleansed with dry medicines that promote the growth of flesh, and with bandages, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If during the operation a flow of blood occurs from the artery, then hasten to detach it with a cautery, or fill the place with cotton: and bind your hand tightly, until the bleeding is stopped.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of these things is available to you, then put your finger on the place, until the blood congeals.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And sprinkle the place with water of vehement coldness, until the inflammation subsides, and bind according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And of what is lighter and easier for the extraction of the artery, it is to cauterize the vein with a cautery having two blades: and let the inflammation be similar to that of two-bladed Al-magdah.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, there are many of lesser acuteness than two scalpels.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp, like the two scalpels, they require corresponding coolness; and they do not cut into the flesh with swiftness.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Since therefore there is a certain amount of roughness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut away swiftly; since this is better than any operation, and easier, and more facile.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let there be a space that is between the two scalpels the amount of roughness of a finger, after you have marked two places with ink; and apply both ignited scalpels strongly, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between the extremities may be elongated.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not consolidate with this cautery thoroughly.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of chronic and acute tears flowing from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are persistent tears and their flow is from the veins that are on the outer surface of the skull; and it does not help to apply any medical treatment with medicines, and you see the face of the patient already reddened, and he feels a sensation of walking in his forehead, as if it were the walking of ants; and his eyes are exhausted, moist, so that they have already been corroded by corrosion: and his eyelids are heated up from the acuteness of the tears. Then the ancients sought help in the treatment of this operation, and named it a cure, with Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is so that you should advise the patient to scratch the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equal distant incisions in the forehead along its length: and let the length of each incision be about two fingers, and one incision should be equidistant from the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of a thumb's movement, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are in both sides: and extend your hand at the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of each incision be the amount of three joined fingers: and have a piece of prepared sponge or many dry cloths ready, with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a spatula of two acute extremities, whose following shape is conical.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is on the temporal part, up to the second incision: and excavate with it all the skin, which is between the two incisions, along with the sfac, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp scalpel, being blunt on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its blunt side towards the bone: and push it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut away with it all the vessels, which descend from the head to the eyes: except what is contained in the incision up to that which appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do the same in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after a quantity of blood equal in amount has flowed out, press out the places from the clots of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put into every fissure a linen cloth soaked in old cottages, and put over them soft cotton pads imbued with wine, or oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And take care that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the bandage, and administer a plentiful infusion with lukewarm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with royal ointment, and other remedies with which wounds are treated: until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	¶ On the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs in the eyes from the internal parts of the head.
Caput V.	Head 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute catarrhs occur, fierce, persistent: and you see the eyes of that person exhausted, small, and already their sight is weakened: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls out from them, and in the depths of the head there is sharp pain, annoying, and sneezing follows: then take it from these accidents, that those materials and catarrhs do not come, unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, as you should gently shave the forehead of the weak patient.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, or somewhat wider along the width, and begin from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be up to the bone: and extend your hand from the temporal muscles, which move during mastication: until the bone is exposed: and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with a cloth of old linen, or with a thread from a linen fabric.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then sprinkle above with powders: and soak the powders with wine and oil, so that a hot aposteme does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you dissolve it, and you see that a hot aposteme is already imminent: then it is necessary to apply cold to the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes the growth of flesh: as if you take two parts from wheat flour and four parts from rose oil: and prepare an ointment from them, and administer it to promote the growth of flesh on these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Of the treatment of what falls into a fistula.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into a fistula is of one of four species: either a mineral stone, or similar to a stone, such as iron and glass: or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans: or it is a fluid substance, such as water, vinegar, and their likes: or it is an animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone falls into a fistula, or a type of stone from those that do not adhere nor grow in the fistula, expose the fistula to the sun: if you see the stone, then distill into the fistula something from violet oil or iris.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and make it sternutate with a poultice, and apply a warm compress to the approach of the sternutation, after you place on the surrounding area of the ear a frusta made from pieces of cloth or wool, and extend the ear to the upper parts.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For it often exits with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If, however, it does not exit, then administer the extraction of it with gestures, that is, with subtle finger movements: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If, therefore, it exits with gestures, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a gentle hook of subtle and slight duplication.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If, therefore, it does not exit through that, then make a cannula from copper, and insert the extremity of the cannula into the ear hole as much as possible, and apply what is around the cannula with soft and moistened ceramic cloth oiled, so that there may be no passage except through the cannula: then extract with your strong attractive force.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For it often exits with what we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If, however, it does not exit in this way: then take from helkalimbat, or from uisco, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it at the extremity of the radian after you have covered it with a decently positioned cot; then insert it into the ear hole with ease, after you have freed the ear from humidity.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If, therefore, it does not exit with all that we have described, then hasten to cut, before a warm aposteme or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of cutting is, that you make an incision on the weak part first in the head: and extract from it blood according to the measure of its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the weak part sit between your hands, and turn its ear to the upper parts, and find a small cutting in the root of the ear near its fat at the depressed place itself: and let the cutting be a lunar figure, until you reach the stone: then lift it out with that which is possible for you from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then make an incision with your hand quickly, and treat it, until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	What falls into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and swell; then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not obey you at the outlet, then take a thin, subtle spatula, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it an excision of that type from the grains which fall into the ear, and do not make it, when you think that that grain has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you apply many gentle thrusts: then extract them with hooks, or with subtle gestures, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction is alleviated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water that enters the ear, it is necessary to use a weak sternutatory with condiments at first: and already fill the ear with some old cotton: and it lies on top of that ear, in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many small stones, according to the length of the finger, thin, smooth, and warm them with fire for a short time, and insert one of them gently into the ear opening: and let it rest on its base on that side, and strike with another stone against the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Do not cease to do that with stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water comes out thus, that you take from a small paper, or from one reed, and insert one end into the ear: and apply the other end to the fire, until it burns most of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another reed, and do that many times, until all the water comes out: and extract it with a cannula according to what has been mentioned about the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal entering into it, if it is a small body, such as a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I have said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body, which appears to the senses: then administer its extraction with gestures and hooks: and its removal is easier than all those that are held in a golden vessel.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in a golden vessel, when you treat it with what we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and your treatment does not succeed: then it is necessary to gaze at the gold in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something appears there from the worms, then extract it with gestures or with subtle hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however something does not appear there, then take a cannula, whose shape is this, narrow below, wide above: and insert the subtle extremity into the gold according to the quantity that the weak part can tolerate: then suck with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do that many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If however they do not obey you for exit, then smear the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	What if they do not come out with what we have said: then administer the distillations which the ancient ones have already experienced in the treatment of worms: and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring out be with which you pour oils and medications into the gold with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see make it from silver or copper, narrow below, wide above, in which there is a small hole.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let it be so, pushing what is in the concavity of the cannula, made decently from copper.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap the cotton around its extremity with decent wrapping: then pour oil or juice or what you wish from these medications into the cannula: and let it be in the gold: then insert the rod with the cotton above, and express it by hand pressure tempered moderately, until the oil is pushed out into the concavity of the ear, and the weak part feels it inwardly: and what is poured into the gold, let it already be warmed up with fire for a short time: and beware lest there be something that distills into it cold and worthless: for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of accidental wounds to the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When sometimes infants are born from their mothers' wombs unharmed.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has also happened to some men that they have suffered a wound in the middle of their ear from a blow or from flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this wound sometimes occurs deep within the ear's passage, which does not impair vision; and sometimes it happens at the outer passage of the ear, and then it impairs vision.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, those wounds that occur deep within the ear, which do not affect the sight, are in many cases difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in those cases where vision is impaired, you should place the ear of the injured person in a sunny spot and gaze into it; then if you see an apparent wound, open it with a subtle spatula whose shape is as follows: its extremity should have a small width, one part of which is acute, and the remaining spatula should be gentle on both sides, so that it does not harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the wound is from flesh born in the middle of the ear, then hold it with a subtle hook and cut into it with a gentle instrument, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the wound is deep within the ear, then take a subtle rod, gentle and warm it with fire for a short time; then insert it into the middle of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel the wound with it, which the injured person has discovered with difficulty of hearing, try to open it with ease; and beware, lest you injure the nerve of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put on the ear a layer of lichen according to the quantity of the width of the passage, which you have wrapped in Egyptian unguent; do this for several days, until you are certain about the consolidation of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Take cotton and soak it in rose water, and sprinkle powdered zegi on top of it, and apply it to the patient.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see that the abscess is already apostemating, then it's necessary to extract the cotton and replace it with another piece of cotton that has been wrapped in a cloth treated with rose oil, until the warm abscess subsides; afterwards, take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If a hemorrhage of blood occurs: then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the abscess; and use the remaining treatment that is described in the chapter on bleeding, which stops the flow of blood.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelids affected by Althel (i.e., trachoma).
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the Althel that occur on the eyelids when they are moist and become dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, it is necessary to hold them with a bandage: or with an unguent, and to bind them with a plaster made from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then apply powdered zegi on top of the affected areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a subtle lenticular cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And it is better to cauterize them after making an incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of pustules on the eyelids.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	It often happens that something occurs on the eyelids which resembles Grandines in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called a Grandine: and it is an accumulation of thick humidity on the upper and lower eyelids.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation for them is therefore to consider then, if it is a Grandine that is forming on the eyelid, which appears as a lump on the eyelid, and they move towards every part, and its treatment is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find therefore above it a fissure along the width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it away from every part with ease, until it is evacuated.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If, however, the cutting off of it is not prepared for you, unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then it will cause harm to the weakened part.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	What if the fissure is large: then bring it together with a suture: and care for it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment restores it, and puts flesh on it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the perforation is sloping towards the interior of the ear against the inner surface, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the perforation with a hook: besides what you need an incision, and press it from every part.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	What if the eyelid is lengthened by an incision, it will not harm that part.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the perforation with salty water: and care for the place with that which puts flesh on it, until the weakened part heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a thickening that forms in the upper eyelids: and it indeed often happens to children: and it weighs down their eyes, and they have a morning discharge, and cannot gaze at the light of the sun, because their tears flow forth towards them, and on account of this they are seen to lie prostrate upon their faces always, and sleep with their eyelids beneath their humid eyebrows, which have already been affected by inflammation: and indeed Axirnath appears evident to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare the threads on it, and make from those threads a circle according to the quantity that the tumor contains on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on top of it, and press with your fingers on all sides, so that the tumor is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then make an incision in the middle of that humidity with a spatula-like instrument, making lateral cuts, and let there not be a larger cut than is made in deep phlebotomy.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary to make a complete incision, until you reach the tumor in many dispositions, for the tumor proceeds from the incision according to the form of a white, fatty crust.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	So extract it with the cloth that you had placed between your fingers to the exterior; and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and beware, lest you touch the incision, so that you do not reach with the spatula-like instrument to the eye and harm it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If however the tumor does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should add a little to the incision with ease, until the tumor proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the site, and bind it with poultices.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are those who apply salt, and place it in the concavity of the incision, so that what remains from that humidity may be dissolved.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however a warm aposteme occurs at the site, then treat it with cooling plasters, until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Concerning the methods of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft, whence it happens that it bulges out as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond their natural course under the natural hairs, and they become entrenched: then they harm the eye, and cause to occur modes of sickness, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and a white opacity, until it becomes the cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir indeed cures the eye according to four modes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or through cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, according to what was mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir cures through incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or through tubes, according to what I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you put the head of the patient on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn back the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned back, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce a needle into it, where there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it back with the needle.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner part of the eyelid beneath the added hairs with a spatula-like instrument incident from the larger lacrimal to the smaller one.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread, and place a small poultice under the eyelid made from cotton or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with ink, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the shape be according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: because it is already diversified in humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there are those who need to be cut from the eyelid a large quantity, according to the quantity which is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, when you find the spatula-like [instrument] above two lines that you marked, and begin at the larger lacrimal duct up to the smaller one, and let there be a single fissure near the natural eyelashes, just like the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce a hook into one of the two angular skin flaps.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then remove the whole thing entirely.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture, using a needle and thin woolen thread: and stop the bleeding, and make it adhere by what is superfluous from the threads above the eyebrows, with certain hidden things, if you want to do that: and if not, don't worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads until three days or four: afterwards take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you want, leave the wound without a suture, and take care of it with that which dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is elevated at the sign of the wound and its aggregation: but the future will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancient Ataxmir taught this method of healing.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is concern for the weak one, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is to make a mark on the eyelid in the shape of a figure, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then elevate the eyelid with three separate hooks, or gathered together, according to this shape that follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small forceps, according to this shape, with equality of incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not conform to that: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert one thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and another thread near the smaller one: and gather the threads together between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then elevate your hand in elevation and make the elevation equal: and elevate the skin above what is marked on the scalp, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and take care of it, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If an abscess should occur at your incision, or your fissure: then treat that abscess with a poultice, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when it happens to the eyelids as well, so that their hairs may be turned away.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary therefore that you use in this what we have said about the incision: but a suture is more artificial for both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the treatment of ataxmy with canes.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you turn away the eyelid, and separate the fissure that is within, according to what I have narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then skillfully make two canes, or two thin sticks: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and the width of them is less than the width of the spatula: and you have now incised at the extremities of both, from both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then bring together each one with subtlety above what is overflowing from the eyelid of the eye, and bind the two canes from both sides with a strong stricture, and leave it for some days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin will be constricted, and will become black, and will putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore it is delayed, then cut into it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is elevated: and the hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two canes, which you make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On the elevation of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation is to receive a subtle needle and insert into it a thread from a subtle silk, fine.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you bring together the extremities of it, and tie them with a subtle knot, so that the length of the threads is one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then you place another subtle thread beneath it in a brief space, and tie its extremities if necessary.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then the patient places his head on your lap, and it should be near a window so that the operation is illuminated: because this is a subtle operation, or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then you insert the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelash, and make it penetrate the eyelid firmly, until you extract it above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull out the hair up to the thread: and insert that hair into the thread: if it is one, or two, or three, no more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the thread in the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If the thread is pulled and the hair does not emerge with it: pull the thread downwards, with the thread that you composed in it, until the thread emerges from the superior opening, and you see it with the vision of the eye: then indeed pull the thread, and the thread: and extract both, and close the eye: and keep it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then associate with it a long hair from the natural hairs, and elevate it with it: or leave it, until it elongates after a space, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of a laceration that occurs on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this laceration occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either innate or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore, it is accidental, resulting from the consolidation of a wound, or from a cut, or from cautery, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operating on it is to find that consolidation, and to separate its lips, and to put between them a linen bandage, and to tie it, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not suitable to use on its cure things that dry and constrict; for if you do that, the Alxatrati will return worse than it was. Instead, use on it things that soften, such as fenugreek: and apply with water in which there is cooked alum, flaxseed of linen; and anoint with dyapallon, which has been liquefied with some oil; and wrap with a linen bandage, and take care with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your cure is to strive with all ingenuity, that it not be consolidated, according to the form that it had at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we mentioned is not anything but a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that it does not return to the form of the place according to what it was altogether.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the cure of the Alxatrati that occurs on the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 13.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati that occurs below is what is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is innate, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one occurs from a wound, or a crack, or a cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operating on it is to receive a hook, in which there is a double thread, and to insert it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread passes through both extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the flesh upwards with a hook, and cut it with a spatula-shaped instrument.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the shape of the eyelid returns to what is fitting, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a rod, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from two angles of the incision, until they converge and an angle is formed: until when they come together, this figure is formed, and it is a praiseworthy Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh in proportion to what is the sharp edge below it, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then bring together the separated parts: sew them with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, with softening medications and bandages, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a scar forms from the fissure and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary to make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what has preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the sermon on the treatment of Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is that one should proceed with the operation according to what is prepared in the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	This indeed is of many diverse forms: and the skilled craftsman prepares his ingenuity with whatever method is possible for him, until he makes it return to its natural form, or near it, and himself, infirm, according to what is convenient for him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the eye with conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	When this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the whiteness of the eye, and prevents it from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you should introduce the edge of the scalpel under the eyelid and elevate it upwards; or extend it with a hook. Then make an incision with a fine spatula, which is not acute at the point of the incision, but rather obtuse for a short while: so that the weak patient may not be disturbed during the operation, and the spatula may be removed, and the eye may be freed from its acuteness. And let your incision be as if you were scraping off that adhesion with ease, until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salty water into the eye, washing it with water; or distill into it a concoction made from zinc oxide dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen thread; and place on the eye a wool soaked in egg white: and after three days use zinc oxide, and with solids, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Concerning the Incision of the Nail-like Projection and Elevation of Flesh around the Lacrimal Glands.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You should know that the nail-like projection is to be treated in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Either it is nerve-based: and it is similar to a hard, fine callus.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nerve-based, similar to a congealed white humidity: which when touched with iron, or attempted to be grasped with a hook, becomes detached, and the hook does not stick into it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both types do not begin unless from the larger lacrimal gland, until it grows gradually, until it covers the sight and prohibits light, and disturbs the motion of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation for its incision is: that the patient should place their head on your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open their eyes, and elevate the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the nail with a few teeth of a scalpel, and extend it to the upper parts.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle and insert the horsehair thread through it, or that of a goat: and let the thread be strong, and double back the extremity of the instrument, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the instrument, and tie it with a thread to the nail, and extend it to the upper parts: and clear away with the horsehair thread the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were to sew it with the thread up to the posterior part of the eye.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder in the root of the tear duct with a subtle spatula, or with small forceps: and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that the flow of tears is not impeded by the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with a scalpel alone: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is scraped out with a gentle spatula, which has this shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the spatula touches the corneal tunic, and a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, apply to the eye some ground salt, or made from zinc, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary, until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	What if the nail is not nerveless, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is it fixed with a hook, then this type of nail is often treated with medications, and healed as I described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	What if you want to cut it, then open the eye of the weak one, and take a subtle, gentle, and slightly sharp spatula, according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the nail from above with a subtle scraping.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is rarefied and congealed, and an impression is made on it with a red or yellow or salty poultice, then distill it from hour to hour in the eye, whether made from sifted [powder] or rubied, or trito salt: and apply it to the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the same operation over it, until everything is removed from it.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot aposteme in your eye: then indeed leave it alone and treat the aposteme until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation over it with a poultice, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The prominence of the tear-producing flesh, if it hurts in the eye with great annoyance, should be suspended with a hook, and a portion of it should be cut out: and not a final incision, lest the flow of tears be disturbed.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then apply to the tear-producing [area] a red poultice, or one made from sifted [powder], until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	On the Incision of Al-Guardenic and Flesh Born in the Eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	A red fleshy growth is born in certain eyes of men, composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps turns them outward: and it resembles a rose-like pimple.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation for this is also such that he places his weakened head on your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with suitable hooks for that purpose: and hold it with one forceps, or a handle.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until everything is finished with an incision.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful not to hurt the eye during the operation: and let your incision be such that you cut with it, or with a spatula, which we described in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which one gathers the asperity, according to what its form will be after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is complete and the entire algardi nerve is removed, then fill the eye with a contrary salty powder; or distill into it a reddish powder, and similar things from corroding medicines; and place over the eye a cotton pad soaked in cooling albumen: so that it may be secure from a hot aposteme.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If something remains from the algardi nerve and a hot bloody flux dominates you, and a hot aposteme threatens: then abandon the eye, and take care of it with what soothes the aposteme.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it with the operation, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do similarly with the flesh that has grown in the eye from this same kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary to avoid strange cures for all weak eyes, either from natural weakness or accidental injury, operating with iron: and do not introduce your hand into any of these operations, until you see that the member is tolerant of that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On collecting pus from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Pus is a reddish vein that forms on the eye, and prevents the power of vision from operating: and weakens the eye over time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye in which there is pus is strong and has no other ailment except the pus: then collect its pus.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is, that you should advise the weak patient to put his head on your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be subtle and doubled, according to this form, or let there be two graduated hooks on one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with subtle forceps those veins subtly, and drain the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and are resolved: and beware not to harm the eye with excessive spatula-like extensions.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the morning, before the sun is high, and you should be firm in your operation always: so that you do not cut unless it is those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have made an incision, then pour into the eye a mixture of green or red: so that its sharpness corrodes what remains from the pus.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If however it is not possible for you to gather all of that at that hour, then apply a plaster to the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it there for some days, until the pain subsides: and protect it from a warm aposteme; then treat it again in the same way, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the method of forehead operations.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the reduction of a nose fracture.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The doctor calls a nose fracture an Arissat, which is treated with cauterization or with sharp, burning medicine, according to what was previously mentioned in his account.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no cleverness in that: unless you make an incision over the aposteme at its birthplace, and extract all the moisture which is in it and pus, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see in it decay or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called a scalp scraper.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made from Indian iron, and its head should be round like a file, which is marked with the marking of a lime file or the subtle marking of an alkilferi file: and put it on the corrupted bone area.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn it around between your fingers, and you press your hand firmly for a while, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the area with drying, astringent medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the area consolidates, and flesh is born in it, and the flow of blood is cut off: and it remains for forty days, and does not break open again, and does not become inflamed, and no accident occurs in it: then know that it has already been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no ingenuity in it, unless one reduces the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is thus, that you detach from the bone with an iron instrument, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is detached, then take the trephine according to this form, let it be an iron extremity, triangular: and its wood should be a pyramid extended to the extremity, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and extend your hand a little from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the trephine until it penetrates the bone, and let the patient feel that; through this, he finds a way to exhale out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with drying, astringent medicines, as I instructed you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh grows, and the place hardens: then the matter that was poured out to the outside returns to the nose: it is therefore lighter on the patient.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	Of the Reduction of the Prominence of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye bulges out with its entirety, and no harm occurs in the sight, nor diminution: then it is necessary to soothe the patient: then let blood be taken from him: afterwards, apply cupping glasses on the nape of the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place on the eye an ointment made from acacia, and aloe, and olive oil, and sarcocolle.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye above with a plaster containing many powders.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of powders is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth is doubled over four times; make many from them: then place one on top of another, according to the quantity which the eye needs: then bind them together with a strong, tight wrapping.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And he should make gentle suction without scratching.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then apply gentle suction, and loosen the constricted eye by day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If, however, the ligament is again softened, then it is necessary that it be tightened much: then loosen the ligament by day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If, therefore, you see that the eye has already returned to its own tissue, it is good: and if not, then apply a plaster, and poultices, and a constricting bandage, and suction, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the Incision of the Tunicles.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a disruption occurs in the tunic of the Vein, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of the Vein, and its shape is deformed on account of that, and it is necessary to incise it: then the operation is, according to what I relate: and it is, as if you insert a needle at the root of the Vein from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle where there is a double thread on the part of the lacrimal, and make it penetrate: and loosen the first needle according to its own arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then incise the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the Vein around the needle: and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract the needle, and place on the eye a soaked cotton pad on the white of the eye: and loosen it, until the thread falls with the Vein.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with that which comforts it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the Vein is tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it should be pierced with a subtle spatula, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and the moisture of the white is drained, and the eye subsides, and it immediately enters: then tighten it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the Treatment of Ulcers.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease which is called Alcomnati is not, unless it be a humor that accumulates in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is, that you should make the weakened part sit upon a prepared or directed seat.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head with your hands from both sides, and move it until you feel the humor passing to the lower parts of his eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is treated, and does not descend, and the light is freed: and the weakened part appears as it appeared: and if it does not descend below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the descent of the humor is not prepared with what we have said, then make the weakened part sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a subtle spatula, and find with it above the cornual pannicle for a short time at the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the crown, until the humor exits.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it exits, then pour warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then it should be treated with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the Treatment of Water that Descends into the Eye, or Cataracts.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already discussed the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for piercing with a declaration and exposition of the sermon; then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then therefore it is necessary to make the weakened part sit between your hands, squared, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind the healthy eye, and hold it firmly; then touch the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand Almagda, if the eye is left; or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the Almagda next to the crown by the thickness of the radius in the same whiteness of the eye's apparent smaller lachrymal canal: then push the Almagda with force: and you will revolve it with your hand, until it penetrates into the whiteness of the eye: and you will feel that the Almagda has now reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measurement of the journey of the Almagda be to the depth, the measurement of the space that is from the pupil up to the end of the blackness: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see them in the same pupil vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put the Almagda up to the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards with one vein after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the weak one will see that above what has opened its vein immediately, and the Almagda in its eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then put it down a second time, except that the Almagda goes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the Almagda with ease: and you will revolve your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something in water from the clear salt of a gem: and wash the eye within with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put outside the entire eye a cotton pad, or a wool infused with rose oil, and of the whiteness of the eye: and bind it with the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, however, and those who are of our time, put on top a triturated cumin with the whiteness of the eye.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	What if the alumga (eye salve) does not obey you at its entrance into the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a man whose eye is hard and strong: then it is necessary to receive the spatula, which is called Alberid, whose shape is this.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	You should therefore join it (the spatula) to the conjunction itself, and not put your hand ultimately in the orifice; and it is only that you may make a way to the alumga place subtly.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the alumga, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare a comfortable dormitory for the patient, well-made and situated in a dark room, where they can sleep on their back; and prohibit them from all movements and coughing; and place their food, that which soothes their nature; and let them not move their head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage be according to its own arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then release him in that dark room, and experience his strength: and make him see things clearly.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not fitting to do that at the time of curing, or immediately after the incision; on the contrary, it is necessary to delay it: because water ascends quickly through a violent aspect.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a hot aposteme occurs: then it is necessary to release the eye before the seventh day; and correct it with what soothes the aposteme until it is soothed: then restore his sight completely, and place an oral application on his face which regulates his sight under those days, he himself being in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him gradually go out of the house, and take care of himself at home.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in this matter the student is not exempt from seeing many times: then indeed he will rely on the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now it reaches us from one of those who are from Alayrach, who said that a perforated wound was made in Alayrach, which is treated with water.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Therefore I did not see anyone in our land who had done that: nor did I read about it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of surgical treatments for wounds, so that they may stand above those who are ignorant of them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	They should be made from copper properly: and their extremities should be with the same subtlety triangular, and the extremities acute.
Formae magda.	Forms of wounds.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the treatment of a flesh-born growth in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When various fleshy growths are born in the nose, among which there is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from these is the cancerous flesh, stony, of dark color; and from these is the soft flesh, not of dark color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In this case, therefore, where the soft flesh from these growths is not deceitful, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you place the weakened patient between your hands opposing the ground, and open their nostrils, and insert a hook into those growths: then draw them outwards, and incise what you have comprehended from them with a subtle, acute spatula on one side, until you know that the entire flesh has now been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If something remains of it from which the excision is not possible: then scrape that off with one of the subtle instruments with ease, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, the blood dominates you, or a hot aposteme occurs: then oppose it with what is necessary: or if it is one of the malignant apostemes, then cauterize it promptly, until the blood is separated and all the growths are removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then there is poured into the nose after the incision vinegar and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose is opened and humidity proceeds from it to the palate, then you will know that he is already healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, the humidity does not penetrate, according to what is fitting, then you will know that there is a carnal birth within the upper nasal bones, which did not come forth with the incision of the instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then therefore it is fitting that you introduce a thread of linen with some thickness, and knot many knots on it: and place between each knot the quantity of a finger or less: and the weak one will ingeniously send one end of the thread into the nose with a rod, or as much as possible after he has made it similar to a silver rod: and draw out its odor until it reaches the guttural region, and emerges above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times indeed, boys in schools make something similar to this, Atomi's device; and it is an easy thing for him who wants it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place two ends of the thread, one end that emerges above the nose, and another that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then the minister is shut off from the flesh with knots which are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do that until you know that the flesh is already gathered with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then extract the thread: and put into the nose after the blood has been purged, a licinium that you have steeped in Egyptian unguent; do this for three days or more, until the unguent corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put into the nose at the end of the matter a tube of lead for some days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it needs drying treatment, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making a head-cleansing device, with which oils are distilled, and other medicines into the nose, make it from silver or copper: something like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passage similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed canal, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And you should make an instrument for cleansing the head, full and detected: which has a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat it in oil or what you want to extract from juices, and fluid matters.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the treatment of nasal polyps.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	A polyp often grows at the tip of the nose, and it gets bigger and increases with time, until its foul appearance becomes evident.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that, it is necessary to remove it at the beginning of its appearance, and to eradicate it entirely.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then apply to the place either a cautery or a burning medicine that stands in its stead.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore the cutting of it is delayed, until it grows, then consider if it is stony, hard, dark-colored, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: because it is a cancerous aposteme.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen those who cut into an aposteme, and great evil befell them because of it to the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the aposteme is of soft touch, not dark-colored, and you see that cutting into it entirely is possible, then evacuate the weak part, and cut into it without fear, without trembling: and treat the place with what draws out and constricts, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, it hardly helps in the operation, unless in certain men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something happens to someone from that, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood: and then apply double-layered bandages to the wound with a suture: then treat it, until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of a continuous wound are already separated and each part is healthy, then it is necessary to remove every part from its own apparent cut, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then bring the two lips together with a suture, and tie them, and sprinkle dragon's blood powder on top of it, and triturated olibanum; and place a fragment of diafinicon emplaster above the powders, and another consolidating emplaster; and leave it tied for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then dissolve it, and change the medicine; and leave it, until the threads separate by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is to bring together a continuous wound, or with thread, as we narrated in the suturing of the belly; or bring together the wound with a thread, as I made you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of lip tumors.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people indeed suffer from hard, grain-like swellings on the inside of their lips, similar to knots or seeds; and some of them are smaller, and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary to invert the lip, and place a thread above each tumor, and tie it with a hook, and cut it away from every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with tragacanth powder, until the blood stops.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it is washed with vinegar, and the place is treated with it, where there is a sting, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the incision of flesh born on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	A flesh growth often appears above the gum, which the ancients call "abuluss".
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore it is necessary to tie it with a hook; or grasp it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the blood flow, or the serum.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on top of the affected area a ground powder, or other powdered styptics, evacuating.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	What if the flesh returns after the cure, for it often returns, then cut into it a second time and cauterize it: for it will not return after the cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the scraping of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When they [tartar etc.] accumulate on the surface of teeth from the inner and outer part, and between the gums and rough, bitter cortices, and when they become black, and turn yellowish, and greenish, until corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through that.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It is necessary therefore that you make the weak person sit between your hands, and their head in your lap, and scrape gently with a file and a tooth, where you see the rough cortices, and similar to sand: until nothing remains of them, and similarly do for blackness, and greenishness, and yellowness, and others until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore what is in them from the beginning of scraping is good: and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second time, and a third time, until finally the desired goal is reached.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth needs various forms of scrapings, many figures: according to what your operation is prepared for: therefore, the scraper with which a tooth is scraped from below is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And let these forms of scrapers be prepared by you, which you will need.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of pain from teeth.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you cure the tooth of its pain with all ingenuity, and be slow in its eradication.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not that the juice of the tooth is replenished when it is eradicated: because it is a sublime substance: until when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary to eradicate it when it is considered weak, so that it may be strengthened and certified by you as a painful tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often indeed deceives the weak pain, and it seems that it is in the tooth's root and eradicates it; then the pain does not recede until the rotten tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen that from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the aching tooth itself is certified to you, then it is necessary to scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side; then move it with your finger or with subtle forceps, first gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the large forceps in a good position on it, and hold the head of the rotten tooth between your knees: what you have held well, so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight out, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it beneath it on every side with ease, and try its movement, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary to fill that hole with cotton; and tie it with a subtle radian extremity, so as not to be broken in the hour of your constriction on it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary to thoroughly clean with scraping around the gum on every side many times.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And preserve your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns to the rotten tooth from that greater evil which is in its first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do what ignorant bloodletting practitioners do in their haste, and the boldness of theirs in eradicating it, beyond what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For often they cause great infirmities to happen to men, which are more difficult to break, and all their roots remain, or some of them; or so that they extract it with certain bones of the jaw: as we have often testified to that.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it is washed out after the excision with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	What if a flow of blood occurs from the places (for it often happens), then scrape off something from the zegi, and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if it does not conform to the zegi.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of subtle forceps which are moved inward at the beginning should be long in the extremities, brief in the handle, thick so that they are not doubled when pressed with them on a tooth: they should be like you see thick handles, until when you squeeze with them, they do not slip, nor are doubled: brief in the extremity and made of iron or forged from a straight center, direct extremities: and in their extremities there should be teeth which some insert into others and constrict with decent constriction, strongly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes they are made in the form of a bird's beak, which is called a ciconia, and they are strong in constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the eradication of teeth and the extraction of jawbone fragments.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains in the eradication of a tooth which is broken, then it is necessary to put a cotton pad on the spot with butter for one day or two days, until the place softens: then introduce an instrument, or forceps: whose extremities are assimilated to a bird's beak, which is called a ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of this is that of forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their extremities are made like a file inside, or like an aleuskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not obey you in the exit with these forceps, then it is necessary to hollow out above the root, and to detach the entire flesh, and to introduce an instrument which is called a small palate, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	It should be brief in its extremity, somewhat thick: and it should not be soaked, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root comes out through that, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to help with these instruments, others of which have the same forms.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangular extremity, in which there is a certain roughness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the triangular extremity, subtle.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also helped with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and iron tools which preceded in the filing of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It is also a help with this instrument that is similar to a large hook, of this form, a triangular twisted extremity, in which there is a certain roughness, so that it does not break; and let it not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many instruments for teeth; and likewise the remaining instruments are not counted, and the skilled craftsman, subtle in his art, finds by himself the instrument, according to what the operation and the very difficulties signify to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For they are from the troubles which are for those things that the ancients did not speak of as an instrument, on account of the diversity of their forms.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the bone breaks from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then probe deeply into its place with what is suitable to it from the instruments and forceps that I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with gestures, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be in it a certain roughness gradually, so that it may be grasped or held with the bone, and not escape and slip away, until the bone emerges; and restore the place with suitable medicines for that purpose.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small decay in the bone, then scrape it of its decay, and cure it, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the serration of prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth do not follow their natural course, they become deformed in that shape; and especially when it happens to women and girls, namely those who are weak.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is therefore necessary to consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth and does not occupy its place, or if it is possible for its serration or polishing: then extract it; and if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it with that instrument, whose shape is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small file, made from iron, with a sharp point, strongly fixed.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cutting be such that you cut it on many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that another tooth is not disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, it is prominent and exposed to its polishing: then polish it with a file made of iron, whose shape is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It is entirely made of iron, and its handle has many small punctures, just like a file with which awls are made: with which the tooth is polished gradually on many days with ease, so that the tooth is not disturbed and falls out: then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	Since if it is a tooth from which a part breaks off and hurts the tongue: then it is necessary to polish it also, until the roughness of that broken part is removed, and it is made smooth: and it is flattened, and does not hurt the tongue, nor corrupts speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the retention of teeth with golden wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth receive a concussion and commotion from a blow or fall: and the weak cannot hold onto what they chew so that it does not fall out: and you treated them with styptic medicines, and the treatment did not help: then the idea is to fasten them with a golden wire: because silver turns greenish and decays after days; but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the middle thread be subtle and thick according to the quantity that it takes between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of retention is such that you take a thread and pass its double between two healthy teeth: then you weave with both extremities of the thread between the moving teeth, whether there is one or several, until you reach the fabric up to the healthy tooth of the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving until you reach the part from which you started: and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom, so that it is not dislodged forthwith: and let your constriction be where you tighten the thread, at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the superfluous extremities of the thread with scissors: and gather both, and turn them with gestures: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moving tooth, so that they do not harm the tongue: then let it be tightened thus until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however it becomes loosened or is cut, tighten them with another thread, and let it stand firm with that for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of Teeth, and the figure of retention of two healthy teeth, and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it happens that one tooth or two return to their place after a fall or other accident, and are retained as we have described, and remain: and no one does this unless he is a skilled craftsman, prudent, and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when something is prepared from the bones of small animals: and it is made into the form of a tooth, and placed in the location, where it is strengthened and tightened, as we have said: and it remains, and is preserved with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Concerning the cutting of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speaking.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When the ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is to open the weak bone in its head in your sinus, and lift up its tongue; then cut through that nerve ligament along its width, until the tongue is freed from its retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it comes from the consolidation of a wound, then push in that hook, and feel it along its width, until you cut through the ligament, and the knot is freed.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, lest there be a fissure in the deep flesh, and you cut through an artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then let it be washed with rose water in the wound's incision, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a linen pledget, which holds the weak part during every night: so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If a flow of blood occurs, then put crushed zinc on the spot.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If the blood overflows you, then cauterize the spot with a gentle cautery, which is suitable for it; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of a Ranula that forms under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural operation: and perhaps it grows so much that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation for it is to open the weak bone before you, and examine the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If you see that it is of a dark or black color, hard, and has no weak sensation: then do not touch it, because it is a cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then push into it a hook, and cut it with a subtle spatula, and free it from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood flows out during your operation, then apply a compress of crushed ice on it until the bleeding stops; afterwards return to your operation until you extract it with its surrounding tissue.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let it be washed out with vinegar and salt; and take care to treat the rest of the wound in a suitable manner, until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the treatment of two abscesses of the gums.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When two lumps occur in the throat, that is, glands, which resemble almonds, which occur before: and they are called two Tonsils: which when you treat with what we said earlier in the division, and do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If it is a hard, dry abscess, of a foul color, with little sensitivity: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it with iron either, fearing a flow of blood, or rather leave it alone until it ripens.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then you will either pierce it: or it will burst open by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is subtle: then it is necessary to cut into it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is, that you should consider beforehand your own operation, if the abscess is warm and quiet, or if it is diminished by some reduction: then thus make the patient sit comfortably in front of a sunbeam, and his head should be in your lap: and open his mouth, and receive carefully between your hands, and press his tongue down below with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made from silver, or copper, which should be as subtle as a scalpel.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you press with it the tongue, and the abscess is shown to you, and your gaze falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and extract it as much as possible outward, except that you draw out something from the tunics with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut into it with an instrument, whose shape is as follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is made similar to forceps: however the extremities of these are curved, so that the opening of each one is directed towards the other acute angle: therefore take care that it be made from iron or tempered steel.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not available, then cut into it with a spatula, whose shape is as follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It is sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut into one tonsil, cut into the other according to the same pattern of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then afterwards gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If a flow of blood occurs, gargle with water in which the bark of granate trees has been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and similar things from astringent remedies, until the flow of blood stops: then take care of it, until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other abscesses will form in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Cut them therefore equally according to what I said about the cutting of the two tonsils.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I have indeed already treated a woman who had an abscess, which was born in her throat, which was pulling her towards phlegmon, with little sense, which had almost closed off her throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had already prohibited her from eating, and drinking water: and she had already come close to death, if it had remained for one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had only risen so far that it had sent out two branches, until they issued forth through two openings of the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I seized them quickly and fixed one of them with a hook.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, and a large portion was drawn out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off, where I grasped it through the nostrils.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did to it what was protruding from the nostril of the other one.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened its bone, and pressed its tongue: and afterwards I fixed a hook into the aposteme itself: then I cut off from it a part of it, and hardly any blood flowed from it: thus the throat of the woman was freed, and she began to drink water immediately, and then took some food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I did not cease to cut into that aposteme many times over a long period: and the aposteme succeeded in taking the place of what I was cutting, until it was prolonged excessively and with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I then applied heat, and cauterized the aposteme in the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood firm therefore from the application: then I walked away from there, and did not know what God did with it afterwards.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the Incision of a Aposteme on the Uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the uvula and becomes an aposteme, and it is long: then it is called perpendicular: and if it is in the lower part thick and round, then it is called a uuva.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: and you see that the hot aposteme quiets down from it, and it is subtle: then it is necessary to cut into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is gathered from it is round, and it has no length, and it is bloody, or of a dark color, or black, and it has no sensation: then it is necessary to make an incision in it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For there is fear about the patient's condition.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	It is necessary therefore, when you see it according to the method which I described, and its length, to make the patient sit in front of a sunbeam: and press his tongue with an instrument, whose description preceded: then fix a hook into the uuva, and draw it downwards: and cut into it with one of the two instruments which I described in the incision of the two amigdale.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut except from that which is added above the natural termination without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut more than that, you will cause pain and inflammation.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use what we have described in the incision of the two almond-shaped [parts], and care for it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If, however, the patient is weakened by the incision, then it is necessary to use caution in cauterizing it without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization in this case is not with sharp water, but rather you should place the patient's head on your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press their tongue with the instrument that we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take the water that I mentioned to you in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with a non-extinguished lime, and place it not too thick, nor too subtle, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, whose shape is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremities of it be where the medicine is placed, concave like the concavity of a spoon's handle.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the same ulcer: and let the patient lie on their side, so that saliva flows out of their mouth from the inwardly administered medicine, so that nothing descends from it into their throat, and hurts them.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you should apply it to the ulcer in a moderate quantity for a half hour, until you see it already blackened and calmed down by the biting of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to receive the crust, and wrap it around the extremity of the handle, and pour the crust with medicine, and insert the handle with the crust into a tube from above, until the crust adheres to the ulcer.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times, until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of your ulcer.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it: it will wither and fall off after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	What if you need to administer medicine, administer it thus: and after cauterization, wipe the area around the wound with a cloth soaked in butter, and clean it with what is around it from the medicine; and cool it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And let it be treated externally with poultices, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This therefore is a more healthy and longer-lasting method of treatment, free from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes it is treated with what is more subtle than cauterization and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calament, and hyssop, and origan, and rue, and sseah, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar herbs: and gather all of them together, or some of them in a pot, and soak them in vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be well-covered with clay: and let there be an opening in the middle of the pot, over which an instrument concave according to this method is placed.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver, or of copper: and let the extremities be introduced, in which there is a grain, into the mouth of the patient, until the vapor rises to the wound through a canal, until the wound is greatly obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat it many times over it, until it withers.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of an acute abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it increases in the abscess: and it is not proper to do that unless at the decline of the abscess's heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a reed, and place a layer of sheep's cortex on its extremity: so that the mouth of the patient is not burned: for the cortex of the sheep prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the extraction of spinal marrow and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many times a bone sticks in the gullet, or a fishbone, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is necessary therefore to extract what appears above what has fallen by the sense of sight, after you press the tongue with an instrument at the root, and it is revealed to you what is in the gullet.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the gullet, it is necessary that you make a weak vomit before food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps indeed the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or swallow a weak piece of turnip, or the root of lettuce, or swallow a small piece of dry bread: or take a piece of dried seaweed sponge and tie it with thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it reaches the place where the bones or the bone are, and it is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we have said: then use an instrument made of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a radius of a finger, and at its extremity let there be a curvature, which easily introduces itself into the throat, and let it have its head elevated upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let it be cautious of the touch of its epiglottis, so that a cough does not occur to it, and it drives out with it the bone, or spine, or the physician introduces it with their hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	Indeed what the weak person introduces is better: on account of their knowledge of the place of the attached thing: and they drive downwards, or pull with their hand and instrument upwards, all that according to the quantity which is prepared for them, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the extraction of leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is treated with what I said earlier in the section on cures with medicines, and it does not succeed, then examine the gullet of the weak person in front of the sun, or at the root after you press their tongue with the instrument that I described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If then your sight falls on the blood vessel, extract it with a small hook, or with delicate instruments that are well-divided.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	What if it is not possible with these: then take a curved cannula, and insert it into the throat of the injured person up to the throat; then insert into the curve of the cannula a fiery iron heated with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times: and let the injured person abstain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him receive a full treatment of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him gargle with it, and not swallow anything from it: and let him move the water for one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the blood vessel falls down at that place when it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If it does not come out with what we have narrated, then fumigate the injured person with bug-like things, or with a reed with an instrument that I have narrated in the fumigation of wounds.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, until it falls out.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which are live coals with fire: and let the pot be covered with a lid, in the middle of which is a hole: and let the extremity of the instrument be composed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then pour out the fumigation, and let the injured person put his mouth at the extremity of the cannula, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the blood vessel.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the blood vessel will immediately fall out.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	What if it does not fall out, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the injured person endure hunger, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that it comes out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the shape of the instrument with which a bloodsucker is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon its own force.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is introduced into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of abscesses, and their section, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many types of abscesses, of many modes, according to what comes to mind about them, namely one, and one in this book: and they differ in their perforation and sectioning from two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one is of the type of abscess that is in itself, and that which comprehends from humidities.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is on account of places, in which it happens through the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an abscess occurring on the head is different from an abscess occurring on the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in a joint: and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And among the abscesses there are those which ought not to be perforated, unless after maturation of the pus in them, and its completion: and among them are those which ought to be perforated, while they are raw, and do not mature according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like abscesses that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because an abscess, when it occurs near a joint and prolongs its being, until the putrid matter that is around it perhaps corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint; therefore it is a cause of more proximate contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess near a principal member: because if you delay the perforation of it until it matures, it will harm either that member or through that principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	It is near the anus, and therefore it is not mature: and it is not suitable, as if you make perforations, a crude apostema, which does not complete digestion, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and extends to the interior of the bowel, and becomes a fistula, or becomes in its termination what is not healthy.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is suitable that you know the time of perforation of the apostema, which has matured according to its complement: and it is at the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and acuteness of the head of the apostema: and the remaining signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is suitable that you make the perforation in the inferior place of the apostema, and of the more prominent elevation: and let the perforation be made along the length of the body, if the apostemata are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of the muscles, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflex.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those however that are reflected, let the perforation be made according to that membrane.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When indeed the apostema is in fleshy places: then it is better to delay its perforation, until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to its complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there are many filth and foulness, and perhaps its lips will harden, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some apostemata are perforated according to the width of the body, according to necessity: or according to that membrane which it needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is suitable that you administer in small apostemata a small perforation, and in large apostemata an ample perforation: or many sections according to the similarity of the magnitude of the apostema.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are those from apostemata, in which it is suitable that the skin be sewn together: and an incision should be made when it has already been made like a cloth, and has been made at the termination, which is now dead: just as it happens in many cases, such as ulcers, and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are those which are cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And one of them is that which is incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf figure.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are those in which a round section is administered, and a lunar section; and similar to them from these sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That one indeed which has no head, such as are superficial lenient abscesses, it is fitting to pierce it with a superficial perforation, or merely a flat one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is fitting, when the abscess is large, and has already gathered much matter, and you pierce it, so that you do not press and extract all the pus at that hour; rather, extract from it a portion of its own.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then apply a poultice to the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do that many times according to the gradation, until it goes out; especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or a decrepit old person: for the animal spirit is often resolved with the exit of sanies; and perhaps the weak person will die, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, this chapter requires great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, by which you pierce the abscesses, it is fitting to cleanse the wound; and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or it is a flat section, then administer a dressing made of linen, or an old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if it is a large abscess, and there are many perforations of the fissure, then it is fitting to introduce a dressing into every fissure, until they reach the bottom.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut away a part of the skin in the abscess, or have hollowed it out around it: then it is fitting to fill it with an old cloth, or as when a cloth is woven, or wrapped with a layer of linen without moisture: and bind it up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then apply it, and take care of it with what is necessary from the ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after it has been soaked into those rags; and apply it repeatedly to the place where the flow of blood is.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If, however, the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary to administer a regimen and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places in this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If, however, it is in winter time, and the place of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary to pour poultices with wine, and hot oil; and apply them to the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary to apply poultices soaked in water, and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that is cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when it will be the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary to dissolve the abscess, and clean it, and administer in its treatment what is suitable for it, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of universal treatment of abscesses.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the path of distinction, I have already spoken about every abscess, how it is a way to its treatment, individually and in chapters.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Concerning the section on abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Head 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Abscesses occur on the skin of the head, small ones, and they are from the species of Knots, which are contained by tunics, which are like little sacs: as if they were Hausolated glands.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many species of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Among them are fatty ones; and among them are those that contain humidity similar to slime; and among them are those that contain humidity similar to frost and pus; and similar to these, and among them are those that are hard and stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the cutting of all and their extraction there is no fear, as long as at their cutting he does not make the arterial counter-flow.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their cutting is, that you may try it with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains moisture, then dry it in the cutting according to the length of the superficial cutting: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the cutting from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture is evacuated, then scrape out the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not allow anything to penetrate deeply from it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns, if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then submerge the wound in Egyptian unguent, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill with it a dressing, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it corrodes what remains from the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then apply the Egyptian ointment to the wound a second time and a third time, and if you desire it, until you are confident that nothing remains from the cyst, then treat the wound with an ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	What if the apostema contains a fatty node: then dry it according to this form, with a cutting having the form of a cross: and apply olive oil between the lips of the cutting, and scrape it out from every part: and test your skill in the extraction of the skin which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, however, the artery makes a counter-flow against you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do in the case of a stone-like apostema, from the cutting and curing, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the cutting above a stone-like apostema is easier: because it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And when there are certain abscesses that are on the head in which some people have, with which there is not deep humidity.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I cut above an abscess on the head of a little old woman, and I found the abscess like a hard and solid stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if someone were to strike it with something projecting, they would wound themselves.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses, however, which occur on the head, apart from these, namely the abscesses that occur on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the section of all of them should be a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make the perforation always from the lower part of them, so that the flow of the discharge may be directed downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat them with what is suitable for their cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Concerning the surgical incision of scrofulous swellings on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin area: and sometimes they occur on other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And above those that occur on the neck, there are one and many: and they are generated from inward corruption: and every scrofulous swelling is within its own proper tunic, just as it is in nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many types of these scrofulous swellings.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And among them are stone-like ones: and among them are those that contain humidity: and among them are malignant ones, which do not respond to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, when you find one of them in good condition on touch, whose color is close to that of the skin, and it moves to every part, and is not connected with the nerves of the neck, nor with the tendons, nor with the arteries, nor is it deep: it is necessary to cut it out by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body in a straight line, and to remove it from every side: and stretch the two edges of the skin with forceps or with many hooks, if you need them, as we have said concerning abscesses on the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is above the caution, lest a vein or nerve be cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the instrument not be sharp: lest you add to yourself a hand with the incision, or disturb the weak, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you cut a vein or an artery, and it prevents you from operating, then apply to the wound a triple bandage, or certain powders that absorb blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acute inflammation subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins to suppurate.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is absorbed by a two-layered bandage; therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then examine with your index finger, if anything remains from the small curved hooks; therefore cut them, and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	What if there is in the root of the Strophula a large vein: then it is necessary that you do not cut that Strophula at its root; rather it is necessary to tie it with a double thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cotton, which you had already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then treat it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire Strophula is cut, then it is necessary to bring together the two lips of the wound: and sew them themselves immediately, after you see that no excess remains.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that excess remains because of the size of the Strophula, then it is necessary to proceed to cut its root, and extract it: and administer the suture as we mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what contains moisture from the Strophula, pierce it with a superficial piercing: so that you may see the place of its maturity: and put the piercing from what follows below in the body, as we mentioned.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then apply a dressing with ointment after the perforation, and similarly to those things, so that it corrodes what remains from the corruption, until when you see the wound is already clean: then treat it with a generating ointment of flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	About the section of the epiglottis from an abscess that occurs inside the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients mentioned this section of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it: and this is the writing of their sermon.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those having a severe cough, it is necessary to remove the section of the epiglottis: since no benefit comes through that: because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those indeed who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or two tonsils, when there is no sickness in the canal, it is necessary to perform the section of the epiglottis, to flee from the destruction which occurs due to suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we want to do it, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis under three or four circular rings of the epiglottis, with a small section in width, in that which is between two circular rings in quantity, so that the section is in the sifa, not in the cartilage: and this place is convenient for the section, since it is deprived of flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary to stretch out the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should open the skin, until when he reaches the canal: he should look for a blood vessel, if he sees something from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the sifa that we have described: and it is indicated above the section of the canal from the phlegm which flows out from it, with that which is disrupted, and by the removal of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the open wound be diminished at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the time arrives in which suppuration is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound's skin, and separate it itself alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Said Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this sermon which we have narrated is not an exposition, unless when they see that some apostematum has already affected the throat of the infirm person; and the infirm person has been elevated above death, and wishes to intercept his breath: they hasten to cut off the Epiglottis, so that the infirm person may breathe over the place of the wound with a certain respiration, and be saved from death: and for this reason they have ordered to diminish the open wound, until the evil of the disease is consumed, and it is an evil of three days, and as if itself: then therefore they have ordered to sew up the wound, and to cure it, until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I have seen through myself is, that a certain girl seized a knife, and sent it with her own hand into her throat, and cut with it a part of the windpipe canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to her cure, and I found her groaning, as is the groaning of the dying.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore examined the wound, and I found blood that had flowed out from the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was therefore confused, because she had not cut a vein, nor an artery: and air was escaping from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore treated the wound, and I cured it, until it was healthy: and nothing happened to the girl, except hoarseness in her voice: and she returned after days to a better condition of her own.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that in the cutting of the Epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the surgical section of the hernia in the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess is called a hernia of the throat, it is a large swelling, according to the natural color of the body; and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is in two modes: for it is either natural or accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one, certainly there is no ingenuity.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one, indeed, is according to two modes: of which one is similar to fatty nodes.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to an abscess that occurs from the nodule of the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in this case there is fear, and it is not fitting that a premature assumption be made about it with iron, unless it is small; and you should try it, and investigate it with a gentle touch.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not suspended with any of the veins: then cut it off, just as nodes are cut off; and remove it with what it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then thoroughly examine the entire area.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with what is fitting for its cure, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On the surgical section on the types of Nodes.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many types of nodes, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division; and it is necessary to narrate here the difference between a Node and an Exitus, since it causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, that when there is an Exitus, there is heat, and fever, and violent pains, until the swelling subsides due to the abundance of matter, and the putrefaction is completed: then indeed the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	But with a Node, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains them in a cyst-like sac, which is their own proper bag, and it is according to the natural color of the body: and their reception is like that of a chickpea, and they are formed like a swelling, and they are larger and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And there are two secondary types: either fatty: or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a node, you should test it and examine it first with an instrument called Intromissum, according to what its form will be in the chapter that comes after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of examining abscesses and all nodes is that you take this instrument and insert it into the moist place which you find in the abscess: and you turn your fingers with it slowly, until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then, finally, you measure the size of the abscess with your hand according to its magnitude.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then, extract the Intromissum, and examine what comes out in its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If, therefore, a flowing moisture comes out, whatever the color may be: then dry it with a superficial incision, according to what I said about the remaining abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture comes out in the track of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty: therefore dry it with a cross-shaped incision, according to this form, as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and scrape off the skin from all sides with ease: and keep it still if you can above it, so that you may extract the healthy part along with the node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the kernel is dislodged during the operation and it is not possible to extract the healthy part, for this often happens, then remove it fragment by fragment, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if some small or large part of it remains, the node returns according to its fullness.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it overcomes you and some part of it remains: then fill the wound at your completion with certain corrosive powders that are sharp: and bind the wound, and put above it what sits as a warm abscess, and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then there is a large knot, then dissect its two lips, and cure it with that which incarnates.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however there is a contrary pulsating vein, or not pulsating: then prepare, and fill the place of the trito with triturated (material), and leave it tightly bound for two days, or three, until the ulcer putsrefies, and the ebullition of the blood subsides: then return to incising that which remains from the Knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Concerning the forms of instruments for section and perforation.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	These are the forms of Intromissors, and they are of three species.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For one of them is large, and one of them is medium, and one of them is small.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made from iron with a square, angled extremity, so that they may firmly enter into the affected part.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Explorers, and yes, that is, perforators: and one of them is named "bers", that is, a perforator: and they are of three species.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For one of them is large, and medium, and small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are suitable, so that they may investigate through those affected parts, and ulcers, and fistulas, and abscesses from what is between them, which is among the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, slender, like large needles which are used for subsellions, namely from citrus wood, or from copper, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better ones of them are those that are made from citrus wood.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And Explorers are also made from black lead, which are suitable so that they may explore through those fistulas, whose concavities are reflections, so that they may reflect with their own gentleness along with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Since there are some that are long, some that are medium, and some that are short, according to the quantity of the amplitude of the fistula and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The forms of wounds, and they are of many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because some of them are simple, namely those with a single cure; and they are of three species, as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And some of them are stagnant wounds; and they are of three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And some of them are wounds having two curvatures, and they are of three species; and some of them are wounds having three curvatures, and they are of three species; and all these are necessary in their own place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, with which they cut and scrape away knobs and abscesses; and they are of three species: because some of them are large, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which a section is made are acute, other extremities are not acute; and they are not placed thus, unless so that with them there may be relief in scraping away knobs with fear of incision into the vein or nerve: and so that the weak one may be healed through them, and find tranquility for a short time, which he finds with the scraping away of abscesses.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are forceps, and they are of three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of copper, and they are similar to a file, with which an alkaline substance is made: and at the broad extremity there is a hidden, pointed spatula; and it runs inward and outward when desired, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The forms of spatulas which are hidden between the fingers for piercing an abscess; and they do not perceive them, the weak ones: and they are of three species, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of bleeding cups with which the flow of blood is stopped; and they are of three species, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made of copper or brass, rounded, somewhat long, as you see; and they should be to subtlety.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these types of bleedings are great and small with you: so that you may cut off the blood quickly in case of necessity, and then when medical help is not present for you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you should not make use of these blood-lettings in every part of the body, and you should not use them except in fleshy places: such as the muscles of the legs, and hips, and muscles of the arms, and breasts, and belly, and groin, and similar fleshy places.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they are made into small instruments similar to those of the fisticules, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Concerning the treatment of breasts in men that resemble those of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men become inflamed as a result of excessive sleep (that is, when they begin to be defiled in their sleep) until they resemble those of women: and they remain foully discolored.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever therefore abhors that, it is necessary to make an incision above the breasts in a lunar shape, according to this form from line to line, b. to line, g. Then scrape away the entire whitish skin.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards fill up the wound with medicine of flesh incrustation.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and take care of it, until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the breast declines to the lower parts and becomes soft due to its size, as happens in women: then it is necessary to make two sections on each side, similar to a lunar shape, which are connected to each other at the edges of both sides, so that one line contains the smaller, according to this form from line to line, b. to line, g. Afterwards scrape away the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the whitish skin, and administer what we have said about suture and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If you do not complete the incision as it is necessary to make, on account of the patient's anxiety or because of a flow of blood, then it is necessary to fill up the wound with a submerging corrosive ointment and leave it, until it corrodes away what remains from the suppuration.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Concerning the perforation of an abscess that occurs under the arm pit.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses that occur under the arm pit are of the type of hard Strophuli, which contain cysts, and among them are those that contain fluids.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those therefore that are among them which contain fluids, it is necessary to section them with a lunar incision, according to this form, from line b to line g, when thus the entire fluid in the abscess is evacuated, then fill it up with an old dressing, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the dressing is removed, and it is treated with a suitable ointment for that, until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess was of the type of nodular Strophuli, then split it open above, as we described in the section on Strophuli, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, the wound extends to this point so as to emit pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we have said previously.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs because of an Artery and a Vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is broken and the skin that is above it becomes consolidated, then often an abscess occurs there; and similarly it happens with veins as well, so that an abscess and inflammation occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is recognized that an abscess and inflammation are due to an artery and a vein are: because when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long and aggregated deep in the body; and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a grating sensation.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is because of the Veins, is rounded in the manifest body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section above this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groins, and in the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is a great fault.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	It is necessary therefore that its treatment should be undertaken with an iron instrument, and since it is also in the extremities or in the head, it is necessary that it should be treated.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Above this therefore, which is from the inflammation of the arterial orifice, find in a gentle section in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free it from its coats, until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce a needle underneath it, and make it penetrate until it reaches the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread at two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place, which is between the two ligaments with a spatula, until all the blood that is in it comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a treatment that generates pus, until the ligaments fall off: afterwards treat it with suitable ointments, until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If there was an abscess because of the section of the Vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what is possible from the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce a needle underneath the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it, until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie it with the same abscess with a good ligature: according to what I said to you about the ligature of the vein, from two parts with two extremities of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you extract the thread, then introduce another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the instrument: press, and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry the apostem in its middle until when it goes out what is in it; then cut into the redundant skin and release what is tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on top of it a poultice which you have soaked in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment, which is done with bandages and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning the apostem that occurs from twisting of the tendons.
Caput L.	Chapter 50.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As it happens that an apostem occurs in the Artery and Vein, similarly an apostem occurs in the Tendons: which occurs from a blow, or occurs from excessive labor, and similar things: and it most often affects those places of joints, or ankles, and every place where the joints are moved: and it is a serious apostem.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to that of the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositional states without pain: and when it is tightly bound with a bandage, one feels in it a weakness similar to numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an accumulated apostem deep within the body, but rather it is under the skin, and it moves towards every part, and does not spread to the front, nor forward, nor backward to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, since it is in the joints, it is not necessary that it be opened with an iron instrument.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps a contraction will occur instead.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that case, because it is in the head or in the forehead, make an incision with a spatula-shaped instrument.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is a small apostem, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and excavate it: then raise it, and gather the wound together with a suture: and treat it, until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the surgical removal of an apostem that occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	It happens to certain men that many times in their entrails and in other parts of their bodies, there are growths which are called Fungalia, by similarity with mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is subtle, and their head is large, and their lips are turned inward.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it is small among them: and it is magnificent among them indeed.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I have seen a man, and in his belly there were two growths, which were more similar to mushrooms than anything else: there was no difference between them, white, with minute roots, and their lips were turned inward, and they were rounded, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I cut into them, and I found that one weighed almost 10 ounces and the other almost 8 ounces. And the operation for cutting into them is, as you consider then, if the patient is moist and humid, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with a subtle root: then cut into it with a broad scalpel, and let your cauterizations be present in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often a lot of blood is expelled at its cutting: therefore be quick if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see a patient who is faint and timid after the incision with iron, then take a thread made from lead, carefully prepared, and tie it on with a stick: this method is what we have mentioned, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the constriction of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not cease to tighten the lead, as often as it is impressed on the growth, until it is cut off, and falls away by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If, however, the growth is large and rooted, then at its cutting there is something to fear and be afraid of: especially because it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Truly, it is possible to cut into half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat it, until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware lest you suppose that a certain hard, dark-colored, insensitive, foul-smelling tumor is not a cancerous aposteme; for I have named it with the memory of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of umbilical eminences.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	Umbilical eminences occur from multiple causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or they come from fissures of the sifac, which is above the navel: and there emerges from it either a gut or an intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or they come from blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or they come from a constricted flatulence in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If it is because of a fissure of the sifac and an emergence of a thinbi (tumor), then it has a color similar to that of the body, and is smooth, without pain; and it appears in different locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is because of an emergence of the intestine, then its location is with what we have narrated, of a more vehement diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and perhaps there is a noise with it; and it is greatly magnified upon entering the bath, and a vehement labor.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If indeed it is because of humidity, it is smooth, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor is it added to.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	What if it is because of blood, then it appears as a dark-colored aposteme with these signs from the gland.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If indeed it is because of born flesh: then it is a grave, thick, hard, and shaped according to one quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If indeed it is because of flatulence, then its touch is smooth.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in that case is such that you should consider then, if the prominence of the navel is due to blood from an artery, or vein, or flatulence: then it is necessary to prevent it from being cured by its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and anxiety, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke about abscesses due to an artery and a vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	Because if the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine or a tumor, then it is necessary to prescribe for the patient, so that he may hold his breath, and stand upright with extended limbs.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then apply signs with a cautery around the entire circumference of the navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Next, instruct him to lean back between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a broad spatula around the circumference of the navel over the place which you marked with a cautery.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Next, extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie him around with a strong thread or with a silk cord, and let the knot of the ligature be away from the abscess.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligature.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you have found it already caught by the ligature: then extract it away from the ligature, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly: and if you find a tumor, then take it with a hook, and cut above its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, however, the opposite is true for you, an artery or a vein: then encircle it many times.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert two needles around the circumference which you made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the abscess in four places above the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the extended flesh putsrefies: and it falls away by itself: or cut it out when it is subtle and putrefied.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what is suitable from ointments until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	What if the swelling of the navel is from thick flesh in it, or from moisture: then it is necessary to reduce the abscess, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with what soothes the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Of the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	Now we have spoken in the division of the species of cancer, and how it is a way to its cure with medicines: and beware of it with its cure by iron, lest it ulcerate: and we have spoken of cancer generated in the matrix, and caution from its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: such as cancer which is in the breasts, or in the hip, and similar members located for extraction of the whole thing: especially when it is beginning small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	But when it has grown old and is large, it is not suitable to approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I myself was not able to heal anyone of them: nor did I see another before me who had ventured to attempt that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is to amputate, and to release the weak part from black bile many times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then bleed it if you find it with obvious fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the weak part for preparation, in which place it is located with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then apply to the cancer unguents that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then scarify it on every side with a knife, according to the investigation, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, but press out the place, and wipe away all the gross blood with your hand, or with an instrument if possible.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, you cause a countermovement of the flow of thick blood from the incision of the artery or vein, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Of the treatment of Dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We will now discuss the division of the species of Dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs: and the signs of each species, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron is not only a single species of ascites: and it does not closely approach the species of tympanic dropsy with iron: nor the deeply seated species of hypochondriac dropsy: for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of Tympanic Dropsy with medicines and your treatment has not been successful: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient is already weakened by debility, or has another infirmity besides Dropsy: such as if they have a cough, or looseness of the stomach, and similar things: then beware of treating them with iron: for that is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If, however, you see a patient overflowing with vitality, and there is no other sickness besides Dropsy alone: and it is not a child, nor an old person: then the method of operation for this case is that you place the patient standing between your hands, and after that, press their belly with your hand, forcing water down to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a sharp pointed instrument, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It is of two acute parts, long, with an acute extremity like a spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, let there be something of moderation in it, lest you should penetrate too deeply with it during the operation and injure the intestines.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a generation of hydropsy from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary to elongate with a section from the navel at a quantity of three fingers, down to the lower direct part above the pubic bone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed the generation of hydropsy is due to a disease of the liver, then let your left section be from the navel at three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is due to the spleen, then let the section be on the right side: and it is not necessary for a section to be above where the patient lies, so that superfluities do not flow back to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with an instrument through the entire skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that section, and raise your hand with a spatula between the skin, and scrape, as if you were excavating it: and let the quantity that is excavated be the quantity of a fingernail, or around that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce deeply until the spatula reaches the empty place: and it is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument, which has this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: let it be made of silver, or copper, or gold, smooth and polished: which has a small opening at its lower part, and on its sides are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side: and its extremity is incised, according to the manner of incising a reed, as you see: and on its upper extremity is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends onto the instrument, and thus evacuates from the water at that hour a moderate quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Since if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, at that hour perhaps the patient dies through a failure of his vital spirit: or a syncope occurs which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its strength, and according to what is indicated to you by the disposition of the patient from the virtue of his pulse, and from his goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then extract the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That which is, because it is retained immediately on account of the skin that retains the opening that is above the wound: concerning which I spoke, so that you may perforate it in accordance with that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then try the instrument on the other day, if you see that the patient can tolerate that: and extract also from the water a small quantity.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that for some days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until there remains only a little from the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If however the time is upon the patient, and you allow much water to flow out: then treat him with warm sand baths, and with much sweat in a hot bath and sun, and wait above the wound: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of water: according to what I described beforehand.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the treatment of infants who are born with their urine passages not perforated.
Caput LV.	Head 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When some infants emerge from their mother's womb, and the head of their penis is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is necessary therefore to provide assistance with the perforation of it immediately after birth with a very subtle spatula, according to this method.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put a small metal hook made of lead into the opening, and tie it: and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore he wants to pass urine, it is removed, and he urinates.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it again.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put lead, now it is possible, that the urine which flows onto the place does not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He, however, whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those in which there is an opening not in its proper place are lacerated.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That which is, because it is born from those who are born with a opening at the end of the virgin head: therefore it cannot be mixed with the front ones, unless it elevates its virga with its own hand to the upper ones.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is it generation for it, therefore, because the sperm cannot reach the womb according to rectitude: and it is a foul and loathsome disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation in that case is, that the weak patient is placed on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of the virga with your left hand by a vigorous extension, and cut the head of the virga from its proper place, with a pointed instrument, or a sharp spatula: just like an incision of a reed, or as if you were scraping off something, so that the middle of it may resemble the head of the virga: and so that the opening falls in the middle according to what is fitting.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware lest you have a flow of blood during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it has often happened that way.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore oppose it with what has cut off the blood, and cure the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning the ulcers that occur on the foreskin and head of the virga, and the corruption, blackening, and adhesions.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These ulcers often occur on the virga, and are a foul prominence of corrupted flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And among them, some are malignant, and others not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	You should therefore suspend the non-malignant one with a subtle hook, and cut it off, until you clean the whole thing.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put on top of it a covered cotton pad soaked in Egyptian unguent.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it afterwards with the dyaphynicon ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	What if the albather is malignant, foul-colored? Then it is necessary to apply a cautery to it after the incision and its own reasoning.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If the albather is caught in the foreskin and not circumcised, and part of the albather is inside the foreskin and part outside: then it is necessary to remove the albather that is inside first, until it consolidates, then cure the outer part: for when you cure both at once, the foreskin does not heal unless it is prefabricated.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And now they also occur on the testicles, and a blackening and corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the entire area that has already blackened and what wants to corrupt or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply a liniment over it after that with honey which has been mixed with powder of granulated cortex and herbs of Tritor's cribellated powders.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this method.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cautery is helpful for two purposes at once, namely for a flow of blood and for a wound when it becomes corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the virga is corroded and destroyed entirely in an hour, then it is necessary to insert into the passage a small tube made of lead, so that the weakened area may be strengthened over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the virga, and this adhesion does not occur unless in one whose foreskin is healthy and does not require circumcision over it: and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or apostema, it is necessary therefore to excoriate it with a dull Spatumili, until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the virga is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	What if it is difficult to discern those exquisite things, then it is necessary to remove something from the head of the veins and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	What is, because the foreskin, when it is subtle, perhaps it is quickly pierced on account of its own subtlety.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin and the head of the veins with a subtle linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not stick together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated with a stitching wine, until it becomes consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Concerning the purification of infants and the treatment of their accidental injuries.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution for continuity, just like other wounds; however, since it arises from our operation, our will, and its use is especially in boys, it is necessary that we mark out a better operation and a lighter way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is nothing except what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	What is, because I have found the greater part of craftsmen and phlebotomators use purification, circumcising with a razor, and with forceps; and they use applying poultices, and ligating with a thread, and making an incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I have indeed already tested all those methods, and did not find a better purification with forceps and ligating with a thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in purification with a razor, the skin often escapes cutting.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the foreskin has two tunics; therefore, perhaps the outer skin is cut, and the inner tunic remains: hence it is necessary to make an incision to cut the other, and future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the purification that is done through poultices, that is, digitalis, which surgeons use, they do not take care of the incision at the extremity of the virile member: because perhaps it enters into its orifice.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing with an ointment, perhaps it will remove the iron and corrupt your operation; and indeed the skin of a child is brief in nature, and often they are born in such a way that they do not need cleansing; and now I have seen that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	Cleansing with a sharp instrument and binding with a thread has given me good experience; because the edges are proportionate to the incision: therefore, what is above is like what is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When you press your hand, the two edges are proportionate, and they meet according to one operation at one time; and a compression is made in a similar figure, containing the skin of the wound on all sides, with which there falls no error whatsoever.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the method of your own operation is to make the child, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, do only what you bind with a thread on his wound itself; and leave it until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way possible to you, because he receives his own understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not sit; and hide the sharp instruments in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his wound, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the wound comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from what has accumulated in that foulness.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards, bind below it a little ligature following.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature's good retention, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upwards quickly, and extract the head of the wound.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better) and apply a poultice on top: and above the poultice place a piece of cloth in which the yolk of an egg has been expanded, decocted in rose-water, mixed with fresh rose oil of good quality; and let it stay on until another day: and take care to treat the remainder with healing, until it is healthy.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	This indeed is a formula for purification, this is it.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two extremities be numb and let them be inclined: so that no branch of a stake goes out from them: and let the length of the two be equal, just like the length of the two arms is equal.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The error indeed falls in purification: because perhaps the entire internal skin has fled, or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary to stretch it out from that hour with your finger before the apostema of the place, and to cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	But if you cannot hold it with your finger, then extract it with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if three days have passed and what is under the rod remains swollen and apostematous, then let it be until the hot apostema settles, and scrape it off with ease, and cut it according to what is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Heal it therefore with what consolidates the wound from powders, which we described in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut from the skin beyond measure, and evacuates to the upper parts, it will not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Heal it therefore with what we have said, until it is healthy.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Concerning the extraction of a retained urine in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction made from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or born flesh, and similar things from those which we mentioned in the modes of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not discharged, and you see that its retention is due to a stone, which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary for him to be bent over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet should be placed on his back, and he should stretch out his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and he should hold his breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Thus it is contrived with the neck of the bladder to expel the stone towards the back: whereupon the urine is discharged.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not discharged with what we have said, and the situation is severe for the patient: then it is necessary to administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose shape should be of silver, and it should be subtle, smooth, concave as the quill of a bird's feather in subtlety of radius, long in similarity to half a palm: and there should be a subtle cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of urine passage through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie at its extremity a wool or a tuft, with a good ligature: and you insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe: and cut with forceps if something overflows from the wool, but introduce it into the cannula with violence, as an emetic.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and with albumen of egg: and make the patient sit on a seat, and embrace the bladder, and his rod with oily humidity, and oil of olives, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the rod with ease, until it reaches the root of the rod.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it over the upper part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe into it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that it has already reached the empty space: and this does not happen according to this order, unless the passage, through which it goes, is one where there is a twisting.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with a little wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the wool will follow the vein.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract it, and make the vein flow through the passage of urine; and repeat the siring, and do not cease to do that until the bladder is evacuated, and finds an alleviation of the inflammation.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Concerning the quality of the cleansing of the bladder with a Clyster.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is confined in it, and there is a desire to distill waters and medicines into it: then let it be done with the instrument called a Clyster, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which is that which drives it, should be according to the quantity that it needs without addition, until when something is pulled out with it, it attracts from humidities: and when it is driven, it expels with it to a distance: according to what the Clyster does, by which naphta, that is, Greek fire, is projected in the praetorian plains of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore you wish to project humidities into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the Clyster into the humidity, and pull with it that which drives upwards, for the humidity is pulled out into the concavity of the Clyster.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its extremity into the rod, according to what we have described in the siring.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive the humidity with that which drives it, for indeed the humidity immediately reaches the bladder, so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a subtle Clyster by which the bladder is clysterized.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made from silver or gold alloy: a head which is higher and similar to a small hook, and underneath it a curve on which the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a razor of the ram, and put humidity in it, by which you can cleanse the razor.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two knots of strong ligature with a double thread: and heat that humidity moderately over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the extremity of the instrument into the vein, afterwards press your hand over the razor with humidity and tightening structure, until you feel weakness, because that humidity has now reached the razor.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you do not have a razor present, then take a piece of papyrus, and make a circle from it, and pierce it with a complete roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, just as it is gathered into a compound: afterwards you put on it what you want from humectants, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it on the instrument: and do with it as you did with the razor from the expression with your hand, until humidity reaches the razor.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already discussed in the division of the species of stone, and its treatment with medicines: and I have said the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys, and the razor, and the signs of all of it: and I have said the stone on which the operation falls with hand and section: and there is a stone properly generated in the razor: and that one which is figured in the vein: and I am narrating this with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that a stone generated in the razor, occurs most frequently in boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among its signs is that the urine emerges from the razor similar to water in its subtlety: and it appears in the white sand, and rubs weakly against its vein, and labors with it, and often hangs.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is erected, and goes out with it anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of children is easy, because they recover until fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in old people.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In young people, however, it is medium, because it is between that: and its stone (lith) which is larger, the treatment is easier; and if small, the care of its reversal.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we approach the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with clysters, which extracts all the feces that are in their intestines; for this is what hinders the detection of the stone during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient is taken by the feet, and shaken, and moved to the lower parts: so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or jumps from a high place many times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands are under his hips, so that the whole bladder is inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then press on him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you feel the stone in the space, then quickly prepare to make an incision over it at once.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	What if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to anoint the index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a young adult: and you insert it into his anus, and press on the stone until it stands under your finger: and turn him slowly towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place where you want to make an incision: and instruct one assistant to press on the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to stretch out the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with his other hand, to remove the skin which is beneath the testicles in the part of the place where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the spatula-shaped instrument, whose shape is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the anus and testicles, not in the middle, but towards the left side of the buttocks: and let the section be above that stone, and your finger should be in the anus: and let the section be transverse, so that the external section is wide and the internal one is narrow, according to the quantity that is possible for the stone to exit from it, no larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed the finger compresses, which is in the anus, the stone at the section, and it exits without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that the stone which has angles and edges makes its exit difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And it is smooth, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, add to the fissure those which have angles and edges.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	What if it does not exit thus, then it is necessary to devise something over it: or to bind over it with a decent gesture, whose extremity is like the Moon, which binds over the stone and does not depart from it: or to insert under it an instrument of subtle curvature.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot get above it, then enlarge the opening a little more.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	What if something of the blood overcomes you, then cut it off with a zigzag.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If there is more than one stone, then push first the large one towards the opening of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then make an incision over it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards, push the small one after that: and do similarly if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	What if it is very large, then ignorance is to make a large incision over it.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it happens to the weak one of two things, either that he dies, or there occurs a frequent dripping of urine: therefore, because the place is not completely consolidated.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	Indeed, administer the expulsion of it, until it emerges: or if there is a fracture in it with splinters, until you extract it from the crushed part.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed the operation, then fill the wound with powder of thure, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and put over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that a warm apostemum may be formed.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then put the injured person to bed with their neck raised, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosened it, bathe the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with dyaphonic ointment and royal ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if there happens to be a warm apostemum added to the wound, and it corrodes, and similar things: as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prohibited from it: and that is recognized by the flow of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore, insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar and water and salt: and apply all sorts of things that are suitable for its cure, until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the entire period of treatment to bind two hipbones together and to assemble the medicinal causes that are applied to the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small and it is in the midst of the vein, and it is fixed there, and the flow of urine is prohibited: then treat it with what I have narrated before you reach the section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times indeed one is excused from the section through this treatment, for I have already proved it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you should receive a Perforator made of iron from Al-feric, whose form is this, a triangular pointed extremity, fixed on a wooden handle.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie it with a twig under the stone so that it does not return to the vein.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing iron into the twig with ease, until it reaches the stone; and turn the piercer by hand in that same stone little by little; and observe its piercing, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	The urine is immediately freed.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outer part of the twig.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	It is broken off, and it comes out with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment does not prepare itself for you, because of something that prevents it from that: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on that same twig between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, loosen the tie, and clean the clotted blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone, except that it does not return to the vein: and another tie above, except that when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and closes the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to do so when you tie the thread above, that you elevate the skin upwards, so that it returns to its complement, and closes the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of a stone in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone is rarely generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if it happens to any of them that a stone forms, then the treatment is difficult and is prohibited because of many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of their kinds is: since a woman perhaps is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second reason is that you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a doctor, when she is chaste, or among those having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is remoteness from the location of the stone: therefore it requires a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	What if necessity provokes to that, then it is necessary to take a female doctor, well skilled: and she is hardly found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you do indeed have those things, then seek a chaste doctor, subtle and present a well-taught female obstetrician in women's matters, or a woman who has gained part of the art in this skill: make her present, and especially entrust it to her, that she may do all that you prescribe to her from the inquiry about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, it is necessary that she examine if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she inserts her finger into her anus, and seeks the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If she has found it, she grasps it under her finger, and then instructs the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina of the woman, and inquires about the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder, and presses with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If she has found the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually moves it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with all her strength, until she reaches it at the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she presses upon it at the opposition of the middle of the vagina at the root of the hip, from whichever part it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger does not move away from the stone, grasping under it: and let there be a small incision first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she inserts a scalpel above that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If she has felt the stone, then she adds to the second incision a quantity proportional to what the stone emerges from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you should know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For it is small and large, smooth and rough, long and round with branching [veins].
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its types, so that it may be signified to you through this above what you have seen.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore the blood overcomes you, then add to the place of the wound a powdered remedy, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is stanched.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone comes out: and prepare yourself with the instruments that I mentioned in the extraction of stones from the veins, so that you may be assisted by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	What if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which has been cut: then put a powder on the place, and tie it with a suitable stricture of bandages: and do not move it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps indeed the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the acuteness of the blood has settled after some days, and the place has become putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	On the surgical removal of a hernia in a watery place.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is not, unless it is an aggregation of humidity in the white membrane which is beneath the skin of the testicle containing a egg: and it is named a hernia.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own proper membrane, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it is felt: which is another egg, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white hernia, which we mentioned: and this does not happen unless rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this hernia is indeed from the weakness that occurs in the testicles: therefore this matter flows out to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it happens from a blow above the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this humidity is having many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or indeed its color is declining to yellowish, or it is bloody red, or foul, black, or it is watery white, and it is that which is in excess.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the accumulation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white skin that we mentioned, then the abscess is round in length for a short time, like an egg figure; and the testicle does not appear, since the humidity surrounds it on all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is humidity in its own skin fold, then the abscess is round with an egg-like part, and for this reason a man thinks it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the humidity is between the skin of the testicles and the white skin, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you make a cognitive effort concerning the color of humidity, then experience the color of humidity in the abscess with an inserted quadrilateral, whose form precedes.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that which emerges in the investigation of the inserted quadrilateral, judge concerning that which is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you should caution the weak, so that they may be bled if possible, and you will see their body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then let it rest on its back on a high place, and put many cloths under it.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit on its left side, and instruct the assistant to sit on its right side, who should stretch out his arm to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the wondrous part of the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and separate the skin of the testicles from the middle along the length, up to the perineum; and make an incision according to the straightness of the equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until you reach the white skin that surrounds it; and scrape it off and observe, or be cautious about this, so that you may separate it: and your scraping should be such as you scrape it off, from the part that is suspended with an egg more; and scrutinize subtly with the scraping according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce a full water-perforating siphac with a broad perforation, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two labia of the section with hooks, and extend the siphac to the superior areas, and do not touch the skin covering the testicles: and make an incision in the siphac however it is possible for you to make the incision, either totally or partially, especially on its subtle side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, there will be no security in the incision, lest the water returns.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If however the matter proceeds outward from its skin during the time of your operation: then when you have completed the section of the siphac, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two labia of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as you would other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find a corrupted matter from the blackness of another, then it is necessary to bind the vessels, which are the suspenders, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspender, and extract the matter: afterwards treat it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water has collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore dry up the other part equally, according to what you did in the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, so that there may be one operation, then do it: afterwards stop the bleeding.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the sections a wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and place before a wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles, and soften the belly: and place above double cloths, and they are poultices: and bind them above with a ligature, which has six threads according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two cloths are applied, and they are soaked, and filled with a warming powder, according to this likeness: and let the extremities be pressed with a hot cloth or damp wool: and they are gathered together with a binding in the loin of the arms: and one extremity receives above the anus up to the back, and the second receives towards the pubic area: and two extremities above the two hips below, and two other extremities above the two groin areas, and all are gathered together with a binding in the loin of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when you treat this ramex artificially with a cautery at the site of the section with iron; and it is, as if you were to receive a subtle cautery instrument, and cut through the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according to what we have narrated: until when it is detected that the white album containing water appears: then take the cautery, according to this method.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letters are assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that album, and it is ignited, until all the moisture emerges.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch out the album with hooks, and scrape it with a subtle, ignited cautery, and cut into it as much as possible for you, until you eradicate all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware lest you touch it with fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is more beneficial and farther from the flow of blood, and better than an operation with a section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If however it causes a contrary effect in the hour of section, or in the hour of cautery, or apostema warm, or flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary to cure what causes a contrary effect for you from that with the treatment which suits it, according to what has been mentioned.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If however the patient is faint-hearted and does not expect to survive this operation, due to its own horror: then administer the piercing according to what I have narrated; and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you, through what we have said about the signs, that the ramex is watery: then it is necessary for you to make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the apostema in its lower part with a broad spatula: and put the piercing according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put it on a cotton pad, and bind it, and leave it until the remaining water flows out: then treat it, until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however the contrary happens with the flow of water at the time when it perforates it, and it does not happen unless for this reason, because a white membrane creates a contrary flow in the orifice of the wound, and prohibits the exit of water: then it is necessary to introduce a feather into the wound, or an instrument by which the hydropic water is extracted, whose form has been mentioned beforehand; or add in the operation of the wound for a short time.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or around them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When therefore it accumulates, then it is treated according to the same method, and it passes through its own weak days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the treatment of fleshy wounds.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the incision above this wound, it is from a fear of causing harm in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Wherefore it seems to me that its dismissal is to be saved from those things.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am mindful of the operation on it, and the type of abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the bodies, from which the swellings are composed: and it happens for many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute or sharp superfluities which flow out to the swellings.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from blows.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a grave abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And when it happens from the nodulation of arteries, and their inflammation: as I have already mentioned its remembrance: or from the inflammation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Which therefore is from them due to the inflammation of arteries, is recognized by the arrangement of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not suitable that you touch it immediately.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which occurs from the swelling of veins is not dispersed by pressure with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a section is made on this species, and on the remaining flesh; and it is to cut through the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then stretch the egg upwards, and extract it with a white cloth: and free the suspensory ligament from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspensory ligament after you have freed it on all sides from the parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the egg is consolidated with those naturally born flesh, then it is suitable that you should pull out the egg, and cut into it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between something from the sipakhah, or in what is between the vessels: then it is suitable that you free the entire adhesion, and cut into it with a rounded incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If, however, there is a nativity of flesh at the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is suitable that you cut through the whole of it, and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil and wine: thereafter treat it with the remaining treatment, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Concerning the treatment of Varicose veins, which is with a Vein.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 63.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Ulcer is a hidden aposteme, which is an inward gathering, similar to a swelling, with softening of the testicles: and it becomes difficult upon weak movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this disease is from fear, because of that which precedes, namely remembrance.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary that we describe the operation on it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that it is suitable for you to make the weak person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then apply the supporting bandage to the lower testicles.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the nearby veins: and let another assistant hold them in place with a vigorous extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a broad, sharp scalpel in a crosswise section directly on the veins, until they are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape away from every part, as we have instructed you in the extraction of the Arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Next, place a thread in them where there is a double filament, and tie it at the first places to which the veins are attached: and tie it again at their ends.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them off in a straight section in the middle, according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from the foul, corrupted humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which it is customary to generate a healthy scab, so that the veins that nourish one of the testicles may fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not an evil through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if all the veins are affected, then it is necessary to extract the testicles along with their veins: so that they may not be deprived of nourishment, and wither away, or become putrid, and may not be a source of trouble with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the treatment of an intestinal hernia.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The cause of this hernia is from a rupture, which occurs in the extended suture above the navel on the inguinal part of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Because the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the suture or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a fall, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the symptom, when it is from an extension of a sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is what happens gradually over a long period of time and does not happen suddenly; and it is an equal aposteme compared to a deep one; therefore, because the sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the symptom of it is when it is from a section of sifach, because it causes to happen from the beginning of its vehement sudden pain; and it is a diverse aposteme, appearing near the skin surface; and that is on account of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it goes out with the intestine a zirb; and it is called this Ramex intestinalis, and zirbia; and when it happens with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And when it flows into the intestine with feces, and is retained there; and it is with that a most grievous affliction of the infirm; because it causes to happen a bad pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this type of illness with iron, there is fear; therefore it is necessary to be cautious in that case.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is, to press on the infirm person, so that they reduce their intestine with their own hand to the internal concavity, if it obeys and returns.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it is supported above its neck between your hands; and elevate its knees.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch the skin that follows the skin to the upper parts, and separate the entire skin of the testicles along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then place on both lips of the section a curved needle, according to what is necessary to open the section with them; and let the section be according to quantity, as much as is possible, so that an egg can come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then remove the skin, and what is beneath the skin of the testicles, until when the white sifach is discovered, hard on every side; then introduce your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphach, which is beneath the skin of the egg, and between the sifach secondly, and separate it completely from the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then place the right hand inside the scrotum to support the testicles; and with this hand, extend the suture upwards, with the left hand; and elevate the opening with the suture to the part of the section; and order the assistant to extend the opening upwards; and you will release the adhesion which is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers, so that there may not be something hidden from the intestine in the hard white suture.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If you find something from it: then push it down to the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle, in which there is a thick thread, made into a licinium of ten threads; and insert it at the back of the suture, that is, the sheath, which is under the skin of the testicles following the section; then cut the ends that emerge from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over others in the shape of a cross; and tie with those sutures, which we mentioned earlier, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligament, until nothing can pass through, which nourishes them, to send something to them: so that hot aposteme does not occur there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place the second ligature outside the first ligature, at a distance of less than two fingers from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures, leave the suture that is under the skin of the testicles a quantity equal to the size of a finger; and cut the remaining whole part according to its roundness, and remove the opening from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cauterize the lower part of the incision of the testicles, from which blood and serum flow, as we have narrated in what has been mentioned before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply a soft cotton pad soaked in oil, and put it on the wound; and apply the ligature that we have narrated.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when you cauterize the white suture that we mentioned, after the incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens that.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And release the bandage, until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, its fall is delayed, then it should be soaked with warm water; and place on top of it what we mentioned earlier, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment for wounds, until it is cured.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Concerning the windy vein.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this windy vein, I have not seen anyone who has dared to attempt its cure with an iron instrument.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first ones indeed said that it should be done as we described in the windy vein that is with a splint.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is to bind the splints above it with a facilitating bandage: then sew in the middle, and treat afterwards with what opens it, until the splints fall off: and treat the wound, according to what we said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the place protrudes, but nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is small, and returns at all hours: truly, if it is prolonged with that time, a fissure is added in the perineum, until the intestines descend into the perineum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And it happens from the extension of the perineum, which is in the groin, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is because the perineum is extended: then it becomes soft and putrid, and the place protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as its previous narrative has mentioned.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with an iron instrument, in this manner: and it is, as if the weak one lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then sew the place of the putrid and protruding rupture, making an incision across its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then you should stitch alsifak and those that are under the skin, until when it is touched, a white album appears, which is under the skin and follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a scalpel, and place it on the prominent area of the alsifak, and press it deeply into the wound.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then you should have two prominent areas on the extremity of the radius from the alsifak, and connect one of them with a suture to the other; then withdraw the extremity of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the entire alsifak, nor stretch a vein, nor anything else, just as I taught you to know in the treatment of an intestinal obstruction.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then take care of that wound's treatment.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you have made the incision, clean it, and restore the wound, until it becomes consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For it is constricted, and not adding to the prominence of the Rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cauterization is better in this place: because it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles often becomes soft in certain men, because the flesh that is between them becomes softened and their appearance becomes foul.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for the one who is seeking treatment for this condition to make the weak part rest on its back, and to incise the entire softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture: and if you wish, you should first remove the excess of softened skin with three sutures, or four, and make a firm suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then incise between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then take care of the treatment of the remaining wounds, until they heal, and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that Castration is forbidden by our law: and because of this it was permitted to me not to mention it in my book: and there is no need for a mention of it, unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of them is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when he is questioned about it, and so that he knows the treatment for which it occurs.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another method is that we often need to castrate certain animals because of our injuries through them, such asrams, goats, and cats, and similar ones from animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore, I say that Castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by subtraction.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by incision and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that one which is done by subtraction, the method of operation is this: we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles become soft and relaxed, and hang down; then you rub them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear to the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal, and press down on the cord of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensor, and cut above each one with a single section, until two testicles proceed: then incise after you have removed both, and do not leave anything on them except a subtle sifa, which is above the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than the one done by subtraction: because subtraction perhaps leaves something in the testicles, for which reason the animal desires mating.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	¶ On the treatment of Hermaphrodites of two modes.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A Hermaphrodite is treated from the urine in two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears in the following space, or in the hollow of the testicles, in what is between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine flows out from what is in the hollow of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, there is one species, and it is the vulva of a woman situated above the pubic bone, like small testicles of a man, protruding externally; of which one is like the penis of a man, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of these three species, two from men and one from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until their impression is eliminated.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then heal them with the healing of remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second species of men, from which urine exits, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the Incision of the Tentigen and the Eminent Flesh in the Vulvae of Women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The Tentigen is perhaps added above the natural thing, until it becomes disgusting and its appearance is repulsive; and sometimes it grows so much in some women that it expands like in men, and reaches all the way to sexual intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary therefore to hold back the excess of the Tentigen with your hand or with a hook, and to cut it away; and not to stop in the incision, especially in the deep root: so that there may not be a flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then heal the wound itself with treatment, until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	A carnosity arises, which is born in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it protrudes externally resembling a tail; and because of that some people call it a "tail-like" disease.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore to cut away the carnosity as we cut away the Tentigen, and to treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of the Alratica, which is a woman's vulva not pierced.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The Alratica is when the vulva of a woman is not pierced, or has a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	It is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	It is accidental, resulting from an illness that preceded it; and indeed it occurs either from flesh born with it, or from subtle thinness, or from being compact; and it happens either in the depths of the womb, or in its sides, or at the top or bottom of it; and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the recognition of it is by the obstetrician's observation, if the obstruction is apparently close at hand.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If, however, it is not apparent, then you should examine it with your fingers, or with a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If, however, the obstruction is from subtle thinness and is close to the two lips: then you should probe and dissect it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, as you place above the two labial mounds.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your index fingers of both hands simultaneously, and let the woman sit on her back with her knees spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch out the two lips with force, until the subtle thinness is dissected and the obstruction is opened up.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a piece of wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the location; and let the woman apply it every day, so that the area does not consolidate into another scar.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the thinness is thick and compact: then it is necessary to cut it with a broad spatula-like instrument similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the obstruction is from flesh born with it, then suspend it with hooks, and incise it: and let there be with you medicines that suppress the flux of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus aggregated with white albumen.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a cannula made of broad lead, so that the wound does not consolidate quickly, hold it for some days: and administer a dry linen dressing, then proceed with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when a swelling appears in the matrix of a born flesh wound: it is necessary therefore to make an incision according to this method: since there is no cancerous abscess, for it does not become contrary with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athelil, and the red swelling on the vulva of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed the openings of the veins, from which much blood flows out continuously.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	Since hemorrhoids are old and established, they become thelil; and I have already spoken about the division of their types and signs in the same chapter, and I will say here which ones receive a cure and which ones do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb and do not appear to the senses, then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those which are in the opening of the womb and are perceived by the senses, are those that can be cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore to introduce the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend Athelil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them out from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over them against the flow of blood from one powder of incisions without causing harm: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then apply her feet to the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, put her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood has persisted: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and cortex of granates, and gall, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it over her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood is staunched with it, it is good: and if not, apply cups to her back and breasts without making incisions.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take a linen cloth and dip it into the juice of tarantula, or the juice of wild pomegranate, or the juice of leaves of aloe, that is to say, of galangal, with a certain Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the aposteme subsides, then treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	The Albarth ulcer is similar to a red pustule on the heads of alhaz, and its appearance is rough.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you cut what appears from it, according to what I said about the lil equalizing: and treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Concerning the perforation of the uterus which occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 83.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	There occur in the womb many species of apostemes, such as cancer, and stone-like aposteme, and ulcers, and adubelations, and alekilations, that is to say, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulae, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and hot aposteme.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already said all these diseases and their species, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I speak about the hot aposteme which occurs in the womb, when it arises from the apostemes that collect blood, and you should know how to perform its opening with an iron instrument.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore that you consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the aposteme in its incision is acute with percussion and flame and fever: and you see it red: if sense falls upon it, then do not press with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps above maturation, until when the acute accidents subside.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat which has two footstools, and recline or lie on her back, and join her feet to the lower part of the belly: and let her hips be expanded, and place her arms under her thighs, and bind them with a convenient ligature to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the obstetrician sits on the right side and administers an instrument by which the opening of the womb is revealed.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes into those things that are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you administer this instrument, to fix it with the deep root of the woman's womb: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and harms the weak woman.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary to place pads on the covering of the deep womb: so that the entrance of the entire instrument into the depth of the womb is prohibited: and it is necessary to place a curl, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and to hold the instrument, and to revolve the minister's curl, until the depth of the womb is revealed.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by hand, and it is gentle and soft: then it is necessary to separate it at its head with a spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the blood is evacuated, then it is necessary to place the wounded lip submerged in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the lip, and extract the section from the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place it outside on the womb, and on the pubic area a clean woolen cloth submerged in water, in which there are boiled mallow roots.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be treated after two days with an ointment that is suitable for that, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the womb and wound are washed, so that it is cleaned with water and honey: then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	What if the wound was hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary to refrain from curing it with iron, rather cure it with what we said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The teachings on obstetrics, how they treat embryos that have emerged in a shape not natural.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to recognize first the shape of a naturally formed fetus.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From these signs, therefore, it is clear that when you see a woman pressed down to the lower parts, and she desires to smell the air, and becomes relieved over what is on her from the fetus, and hastens the exit of the embryo: then know that this fetus is according to its natural shape, and its exit is through its own head, and the afterbirth with it: or hanging, or suspended from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary that her womb be compressed, so that the embryo may come down quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it comes down through its own head, the afterbirth comes down with it, and is cleansed of those excessive impurities by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But one that is beyond this fetus is unnatural, inadvisable.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	Because sometimes the fetus comes out on its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and one of its hands or one of its feet: or its head and one of its hands come out: or its belly comes out: and perhaps it turns over onto its neck, and similar things from unnatural shapes.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary therefore for the obstetrician to be prudent and subtle in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every shape from them, and how the ingenuity is in it, and is signified by that, and stands upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus comes out through its own natural exit, and it is difficult for the woman, and the childbirth is hard for her, and you see that her strength is already debilitated: then make her sit on a chair, or let other women hold her: and apply warm vapors to her womb with decoction of fenugreek, and with humid olive oil.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife inserts a small spatula between her fingers and finds the second one with it, and separates it from her nail, until she feels what is in it from the moisture: and presses on the woman's abdomen, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be anointed with a clyster of fenugreek, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then advise her to compress herself after the clyster, and make her sneeze with the conditions, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary to reduce them with gentle facilitation little by little.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not obey at the entrance, then put the woman on a chair, and elevate her feet upwards; then strike the chair on the ground; and let the woman be held, so that she does not fall at the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut them, and extract the remaining part of the fetus: and bind her hand with a cloth, and extract it with equality: for it itself will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The extraction of the embryo from its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out onto its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; afterwards, convert the fetus little by little; subsequently, straighten it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they come out as far as the hips, then advise her to compress herself, and make her sneeze with the conditions; for it will come out, if God wishes.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have narrated, then reduce the fetus little by little, until you place it according to its natural figure.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it itself will come out then with an easy delivery.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is prohibited with all that we have narrated: then take from the mucilage of the altea, and oil of sisamin, and dissolved gum: and strike everything in a mortar with good percussion. Then apply it to the wound of the woman's vulva, and beneath her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then have her sit in warm water, until she feels the hypochondrium.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that the lower parts are already warmed up, then have her receive a suffumigation of myrrh: and apply it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she holds the suffumigation for one hour, then have her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then have her sniff it out: and clear her nose and mouth: and press the lower part of the belly with easy compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The delivery of the fetus on knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out according to this method, then she should introduce her hands little by little.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should be raised to her neck, and her feet should hang down below: and she herself should sit on a bed, and fold her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press above her belly little by little.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under her feet from the pillows, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them with a vigorous motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the hypochondrium little by little, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then introduce her hands and adjust the fetus little by little: and instruct the woman to press, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The delivery of the fetus, hanging sideways from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	It is introduced in the reduction of her hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If she cannot reduce it, then raise the woman up, and have her walk around.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If indeed he cannot walk, then make him lie on a bed and shake his hips with a vigorous concussion.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment you prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	What if he receives that potion, then make him sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study the reduction of the hand, and equalize the foetus according to the natural figure: and make the woman sneeze, and order her to compress herself until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the foetus is over its neck, with hands extended, and its face is towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife holds the hand of the foetus, then turns it around slowly, and adjusts it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is adjusted, then put on its belly what we have prepared from oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then order her to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and order her to lean towards the right side.

¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared foetus is on its side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the maternal orifice in this manner with the afterbirth, then separate the afterbirth with your finger, until it is evacuated from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended over the face of the foetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and does not die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the foetus towards the interior, until you place it according to what is proper: and order the woman to compress herself several times: for indeed it will come out with a gentle exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or many foetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that external thing is rare and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	There are five things beyond nature, and they do not penetrate deeply; and they bind them, however much they multiply, with a secondary one; and they are separated by a suture, distinguishing between them the tied part in each of their navels.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And when they emerge, just as one fetus emerges by a natural outlet, easily; and they emerge by an unnatural outlet, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If they are difficult when some of them are at the part, and they reach that which we said from unnatural figures, then treat them as we have narrated; and let there be a subtle and precise treatment, and let it do what it does with facility and slowness, and let it be adapted according to every figure with what is prepared for it by a leading ingenuity for health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	The reminder of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten; and it has already been verified by me, that a woman aborting has expelled seven, and another fifteen, all fully formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, this whole thing is necessary for it to be in the science of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps indeed it will reach that similar thing: therefore let it be opposed to it with what is fitting.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the division from medication, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use manual operation, then it is necessary to consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If the woman is of healthy virtue, and she does not have any of the accidents from which loss is feared on her behalf: then it is necessary for the woman to be placed on a bed, on her back, with her head inclined downwards, and her thighs elevated; and an assistant should hold her from both sides, or bind her to the bed, so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the wound of the matrix with humid oils, along with mucus from the flax plant, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then anoint the midwife's hand with these oils and mucus; then insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then feel with it the place where the fetus is stuck, and find a convenient position for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider therefore then, if the fetus is prepared to descend onto its own head: then fix hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or on its palate, or under its beard, or in its armpits, and near its ribs, and under its hip bones.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is onto its feet, then in its pubic area, and its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary to hold the hook with the right hand, and place its curvature in what is between the fingers of the left hand: and insert it with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places that we mentioned, until it reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fix another hook opposite it, or a third if necessary: so that there is equal traction, and it does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it is extended with equal extension, and not only stretched in a straight line, but rather moved to every side, so that the outcome of its extraction may be alleviated: just as it is done with a tooth during its removal.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in what is between them, to soften the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part of it is retained, then it is necessary for the midwife to anoint certain fingers with oil and insert them from one side, so that she may revolve what is retained with them.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks are changed to another place that is higher: do this until the entire fetus emerges.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand protrudes before the others, and it is not possible to reduce it, on account of its contraction: then it is necessary to wrap a bandage around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it thus when it protrudes entirely, either by cutting into the joint of the sole or in the elbow; and thus it is necessary to do likewise on the other hand, and on both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the head of the fetus is large, or there happens to be a contraction at the outlet, or there is water accumulated in its head: then it is necessary to introduce between the fingers a spatula with a pointed end, and to find the head with it, and to extract the water: or to dislodge it with an instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of other instruments in the chapter that follows this one.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Likewise, if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary to sever the shoulder joint; or to extract it with a misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then hook out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	What if the head protrudes and is constricted at the waist: then it is necessary to feel around until the moisture that is in the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however it does not progress and does not come out at the outlet: then cut the head a little, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	What if the lower part of the abdomen is inflamed, or there is dropsy in it: then it is necessary to perforate it, until the moisture flows out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If however the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the womb's mouth is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If however it is constricted at the abdomen or chest: then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand; and feel the abdomen or chest, until what is in them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If however the remaining limbs are exhausted and the head returns: then the Obstetrician inserts their left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the womb is open, then they insert their hand deeply into the womb and feel with it the head, and draw it out with their fingers up to the mouth of the womb: then they insert one hook or two hooks, and draw it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the womb is constricted, because of the warm apostema that has happened to it: then it is not fitting to struggle over it, but rather to administer an effusion of humid and greasy things, and apply an emollient plaster: and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to straighten it: then administer what we said regarding the living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible, then it should be dissected piece by piece and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything of the secondine inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said regarding the warm apostemas that occur in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If a flow of blood occurs, then sit in astringent waters and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I have indeed already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was: then she became pregnant again with another, afterwards that other fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	So it happened to her after a long time an apostema in her navel, and it became swollen, until it opened: and began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore called to her treatment, and I treated her for a long time: but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I then applied to it certain strong attractive plasters: and it came out from its place, the bone.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was amazed therefore, since there is no bone in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought therefore that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I examined the wound, and I extracted many bones, while the woman was in her best dispositions: and already she had lived a long time, and a little pus came out from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not confirm this external thing, unless there is science in it, and help for that which the skilled physician administers with his hand from the healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of necessary instruments for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is described the form of the Forceps, which are equalized to books, which have two equal arms at the extremities of two wooden handles.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this vertigo ought to be more subtle than the forceps: and that it may be so, whether made from ebony or from boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of all the wood is almost two fingers: and the edge of each of the two is almost one finger, and their length is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two wooden pieces are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed to both, whose length is a half-palm plus a little: and the width of each is almost two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the maternal passage, so that they open with them when you turn the two Forceps.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the Forceps which opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made from ebony wood or boxwood, according to the similarity of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its extremity there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition is almost a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you are about to dissect a corpse with it, then make the woman sit on a couch, with her feet hanging down, opening what is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two connected additions into the corpse, and you holding the instrument's extremity below between her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, just as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity that you wish to open in the mouth of the corpse, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The shape of a Turning alternative to what the ancients said, the Shape of an Expeller by which the fetus is expelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The shape of Almisdac, where the large head is constrained: and it is similar to forceps, which have teeth at the extremity, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is made oval, like forceps according to this shape, as you see, which have teeth like serrated teeth, by which it is cut and constrained.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The shape of Almisdac where the small head is constrained.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The shape of a Ring having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The shape of a Ring having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The shape of forceps which have serrated teeth, by which the head of the fetus is constrained.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The shape of a Spoon-like instrument having two extremities for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The shape of two Spoon-like instruments, also wider ones.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are exercised, and the more their species are multiplied, and they are prepared by the craftsman, the swifter is their operation, and the more esteemed they are among men, due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Do not despise any of these instruments, as long as it is prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For the necessity of them is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	¶ On the extraction of the Afterbirth.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second ligature is retained at the wound, then it is necessary to apply a compress to the weakened area, so that it may retain its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sternutate with concoctions; and bind your hand over her bone, and her nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it goes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot, and perforate it in the covering hole: and put in it herbs opening up the womb, such as marjoram, rue, and anise, and chamomile, and senna, and lignified cassia, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put an embryo of a certain bush over the hole of the covering pot, and another extremity into the womb: and hold it until the vapour reaches the concavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sternutate, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the second ligature will go out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this cure, and does not go out: then instruct the Midwife to submerge her hand in sesame oil or muck of altaea.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then she should insert it into the womb and seek the second ligature with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore she has found it, then she should receive it and pull it out little by little.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it has been attached deep in the womb, then she should insert her hand according to what we have narrated, until when she finds the second ligature, and pulls it out little by little according to rectitude, so that the womb does not fall apart at the vehement attraction: indeed it is necessary, so that it may be turned with ease to the right and left sides: then it should be added to the quantity of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it has obeyed then, and is preserved, and is freed from adherence.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the maternal bone is constricted, as we have already narrated: treat it with sternutatio, and from medicine of the ollea with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If however it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then beware lest you weary yourself over it in the repetition of the extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	It is necessary, so that what comes out from the maternal bone, binds to the hip joint of the woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then anoint it with a tetrapharmacon ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will putrefy itself after days, and dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it putrefies, a bad smell rises from it to the stomach and head, and hurts that weak woman.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is necessary therefore that suitable fumigations be administered to her.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated at the retention of the Secondina and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from a similar glass or from zere: and let a broad extremity be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed over the woman's thighs: let it hold her, until that fumigation is consumed: and then another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Concerning the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their anus is not perforated, which has already been obstructed by a subtle sip of milk.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary therefore that the midwife should perforate it with her finger: and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp spatula: and let her beware lest she hurts him.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put on it a woolen cloth infused with wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with ointments, until he is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If however it is blocked, then put a cannula of lead in the orifice for many days, and it will be digested when the boy wants to expel.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now there occurs a blockage of the anus also from the consolidation of the wound or from an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary therefore that the consolidation be cut, then treated with what we mentioned regarding treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Of the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower part are a swelling and a hardness which occur near the anus outwardly: or in a single part of the body: and it is one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that swelling becomes old, it opens, and there flows out from it a watery white fluid, or subtle pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes they are penetrating fistulas from these.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore the penetrating ones are recognized by that which comes out from straining and flatulence, when the weak person is straining, and perhaps worms come out from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And they are fistulas when they are penetrating in the body up to the bladder, and up to the root of the penis.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating ones up to the joint of the hip, and up to the knot of the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this it is recognized that the penetrating fistula reaches up to the anus, and also from the non-penetrating one, by inserting your index finger into the anus: and you insert a subtle probe into the fistula through a tube or iron, when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is twisting in it, then insert into it a subtle probe of lead, or a pin from horsehair pillows, until you feel the probe, or pin on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it deeply, nor does anything proceed from the orifice during straining, nor flatulence, nor worms as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when a fistula is penetrating to the bladder or to the urinary meatus: then its indication is the outflow of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place may be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it is penetrating to the joint of the hip, or to the mouth of the hip: then its sign is that it reaches the tendons up to that place, if there is no twisting up to the mouth: and the discovery of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus always flows out from it: and that medicine is not effective for it, nor is it consolidated with an ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure: and the treatment of them is labor and vanity to him, by foolish doctors, who are deceived about it.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that one, however, which is not penetrating and not chronic, healing can be hoped for with a serum: according to what I tell you, and I have already proven it: and it is so that the patient lies between your hands on his back: and lift his legs up above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his abdomen.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then a lead or copper probe is inserted, if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where it reaches the tendons.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If however the patient feels it around the anus, then it is necessary to insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel with your finger the tendons already penetrated by themselves detected, besides what you feel between your finger and the skin, or flesh: then therefore you know for certain that it is penetrating: so do not labor in it, because there is no healing of it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They have said, however, that it can be healed in certain men with flesh, and from the medication by which they hope for a benefit, it is to apply a subtle cauterizing fire according to the width of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and insert the ignited thing into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice or three times, so that you know, because those added fleshy growths are already purified, which are similar to the quill pen of a bird.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with liniments wrapped in butter, until those fleshy growths emerge, which are purified: then treat it with salves that generate and consolidate flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it does not heal with any other treatment ever.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it emerges as a point, and has not penetrated up to your finger, which is in the anus, and there is a thick or fleshy or scabby obstacle between it and the point, or scab: and you see a Fistula in that which follows the surface of the skin, then you cut the skin from the beginning of the Fistula, and you guide the cutting with the point that is in the fistula, until the cutting reaches where the point of the fistula ends, and the point is freed and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those fleshy growths purified, which are similar to the quill pen of a bird, so that nothing remains in them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however blood overcomes you, and flows between you and your operation, separating those fleshy growths: then it is better to do what is done, and for the sake of swift healing, to cauterize it with fire, or with acute medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Since cauterizing with fire gathers good habits, to the purification of those added fleshy growths, and to the stopping of blood, and to the drying of moistures.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with liniments wrapped in butter, or with triturated onions, until the place emits pus, and those purified fleshy growths emerge in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating salves, generating hard flesh: and there are medicines in which there are astringents and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when you restore, then already it will be healed; and not in vain repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If, however, the fistula has already reached deep into the anus and is prolonged by the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus and examine it with that.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If you feel a tension, and between you and it there is a thin layer of sifac or flesh, and it is close to penetrating: then it is not an operation on that, unless according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because one of the three methods is administered in it: either you cauterize it, as we said: or you dissect it, until you arrive at its concavity, so that it is possible for you to introduce a license and a cure from what is nearest.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And you do not proceed much with the cutting, so that you do not injure the surrounding tissue of the anus, and there is no harm to the weak exit of the evacuation without control.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed: or you will prolong it with a thin layer, and cleanse it after you have cut it up to the anus, as we said, or with a tent or with another instrument of the acute extremity.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh wounds which are in the cutting, until where you are able to do so with careful examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then try to restore the whole wound with the cutting, and the upper orifice where it is consolidated: and a open fistula will remain in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter on the weak.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula follows this method: and it is when you insert a tent into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with the skin and edge of the anus: then receive the perforated extremity of the tent, which is like a needle, that is, preparing the leather, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a twisted thread made from five threads, and wrap around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If it is penetrating to the margin of the anus internally near, then extract the thread from that orifice: just as you insert your finger into the anus and extract the end of the thread, and join the two ends together: and tie them both, and leave it for one day or two days: and the more the thread penetrates into the flesh, tighten it well, until those fleshes which are between the two ends of the thread meet and fall away: then cure the wound, until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	But if the orifice of the fistula does not penetrate: then make it penetrate by whatever means are prepared for you, unless it is deeply situated.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not fitting for you to do that on account of the ligature, lest you injure it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	You should make a spoon-shaped instrument for the spiny fistula, whose curvature is acute and very sharp, and the other part is not acute, so that it does not injure what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows out from the incision of these: and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two modes.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are inside the anus, like small bladders of carbon, or pomegranates: or as if they were grains of a grape.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And among them there are small ones and large ones: and blood flows out from them always, and it is one, and they are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and on its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are, for the most part, of scanty humidity, from which a watery discharge flows, or a little blood in a steady flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is within the anus is to press on the weakened area so that it may be felt: and it should be pressed until it comes out of the anus, and the stringy fibers of the thigh appear.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, you should hang it with hooks: or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them off at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If however they are not retained by the hooks, due to their moisture and softness: then seize them with rough cloth, or with a double-layered linen bandage, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them off, and sprinkle some hot powders over them after the incision, so that they may take the place of a cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not obey the evacuation, then inject a weak enema into the rectum, where there is a small bite, so that it may be washed out with what is in the anus, and it may quickly obey the evacuation, when the weakened area expresses itself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however the stringy fibers are external to the anus, then their removal is easy, effortless: and it is as if you grasp them with your fingernail, or grasp them with a hook, and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And for those who shy away from the incision with iron, then it is necessary to administer their suture according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a twisted thread, and insert it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw out the stringy fibers upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root on the other side: and twist the two ends of the thread at the lower part of the needle, and let them be transverse: and constrict the stringy fibers with a strong binding.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie a knot in the thread, and extract the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Make an incision with all the athletic (muscular) strength, and let out one of them: nor press it yourself, so that it flows out with a surplus of blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then put on the wound a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate, and place it on the wound: and apply pressure to the weak area, so that it quiets.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let it fall off by itself, until it drops away.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the athletic (muscular) strength falls away, treat them with ointments and the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For they often occur due to dryness of the feces and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they become old and medicine is of no avail in them: then it is necessary to scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your finger, until they become moist, and the outer cortex which prevents their consolidation is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them, until they consolidate according to what is fitting.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not consolidate: then treat them again with a more vigorous scraping than before, until they bleed much and are cleansed; then treat them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of inverted hernias and not of inverted ones: and of muscular ruptures and of wounds caused by friction.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You know that a hernia is nothing but a rounded knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs throughout the entire body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and it causes pain when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary therefore to cut what is around the nail, and to hold it with forceps or with a hook, and to eradicate it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat that: and if you want to cauterize that according to what was mentioned previously in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	One of them is a small, rough, flaky, rounded elevation on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur on the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is to stretch out the elevation, and to cut into it, or to tie it with a silk thread, or with a hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been previously mentioned with fire, or with a sharp medicine, and now the inverted elevations are eradicated, and not the inverted ones with the instrument that I will describe.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A small flaky elevation is also a rough, superficial growth on the body, eating deeply into the skin; and when it finds cold, it feels like the sting of an ant, and it causes pain throughout the whole body; and mostly it occurs on the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is to take a small tube made from the feather of a goose or a strong vulture's feather, and place that tube over the ant-like growth, until it encircles with the parts of the tube.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then revolve your hand with the tube, until you squeeze out what is around the ant-like growth; and put it deep into the flesh, and eradicate the ant-like growth from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, make that with a tube of copper or iron, according to this method.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the tube be applied to the limit of the swelling, drawing out what is beneath, so that it may be alleviated above the finger and its own rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the ant-like growth according to what has been previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization of Elevation.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Concerning the forms of instruments which are administered for enemas in ailments of the anus, and solutions of the belly, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes the enema instrument is made of silver, or of gold alloy, or of fused copper, or of hammered metal.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when it is made small from these instruments, and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of small children, let it be small: and for those whose veins are weak or painful, thus also their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	A large enema.
Cistere paruum.	A small injection.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The tube of it, that is, the upper part where the ligature is tied, should be large according to this method: and let there be a distinction so that the ligature is tied as you see, and the lower end which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt, that is, not open, gentle, indeed, drawing towards subtlety: and on one side of it there should be two openings, and on the other side an opening.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the openings be according to the thickness of the radices, and let it be thicker for a small one, and let there be an intestine in which medicines are placed from the bladder of an animal: or from the paper of an owl, which should be according to the form of a small asafoetida: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let it be pierced with many openings as it revolves, and let there be a space that is between all the openings the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those openings a strong thread made from raw thread, which should be of ten threads, or around that, and tie it with the intestine like an asafoetida.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore the intestine is placed in it, let it be tied at the head of the enema between two distinct constrictions with a strong binding.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then inject the enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of a circle as depicted here, and of the openings.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of injecting with it, however, is: that you should fill the intestine, or bladder, with a medicine which is warmed according to the quantity of the tolerance of the sick person: and take care that it not be too hot, nor too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the weak patient is placed on his back, and his thighs are elevated to a higher position: and a soft cloth, that is, a cushion, is put underneath him, on which the men who are performing the operation sit.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the extremities with a cluster of olives, or with album gypsum, or with foeniculi of galbanum, or similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the assistant should take the uterus with both his hands at once, and press it out with great force, until everything that is in the Cluster (enema) goes into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then withdraw the cluster, and elevate the patient's thighs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	What if the medicine thinks it is going to an exit, then he should hold on as much as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is more useful in the treatment.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If, however, you cluster him in the solutions of the belly's agitations, and hasten his evacuation: then repeat the clustering until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	What if there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or painful apostemes, then let the clustering be gentle, mild, from the clusterings with which children are clustered.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of gentle clustering upon a constricted skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of head wounds without fracture of bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head 83.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	Now I have spoken in the division on the treatment of wounds that it was fitting for the book, and I will say here their treatment with manual handling, and with medicines according to their completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore that wounds are diversified according to the thing by which they are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	There are therefore many ways in which wounds are made, such as a blow of a stone, or a cut of a sword, or a stab of a dagger, or a strike with a lance, or a wood, or an arrow: and similar things from many other causes.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that are inflicted according to the location of the body are, such as a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver: and similar ones from these members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am describing the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may establish a reasoning and rule about the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I begin with simple head wounds, because the recollection of the composite wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then if it is from a blow of a stone or similar things, and has only bruised the skin: and it is a great wound, and there is a tendency to inflame the weak aposteme with hot swelling: then hasten, and perform phlebotomy on the head immediately: and do not delay: and extract from him as much blood as his strength allows, according to the quantity of his virtue: if nothing prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood that flows out of the wound is scant.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite part of the wounded area.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the weak person beware of repletion, and wine, and coarse foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If something prohibits moderation, then let it be diminished from food, and not approach flesh, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And apply to the wound if it happens to have a hot aposteme, a cloth soaked in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is stipation.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you have been free from the hot aposteme, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood, and has not changed the air, a powder which I will describe shortly: and if it has already changed the air, then apply to it certain ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large, or it is from an incised wound, and similar: and its lips do not adhere through granulations, then they are joined together with a suture, according to what I will describe about the sutures of wounds in the belly.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the wound is already opened up to the bone, and it is hanging, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspension: then incise it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medications, and restore to it hard flesh in place of skin, and prescribe to the weak person, that they take nourishing foods in which there is richness, such as are heads, and cooked wheat, until it be like a pulse: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then incise the entire putrefied area, and cast it away: then treat what remains.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If however in these wounds there is an artery, or a vein from which blood flows: and it does not stop by means of medications, then make a ligature above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it is not cut, then dry it with a cautery, or tie it off.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity demands when what we have said does not help, then cauterize it, until the blood is staunched.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however the wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, light: so that you dust them with this powder: because it consolidates them before they suppurate.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The method of applying the incarnative powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of olibanum, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unextinguished lime: grind everything into a fine powder, and sift it: and fill the wound with it, and constrict it with a good bandage, until it adheres well to the wound, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then tie it above with a compress and leave it, and do not loosen it as long as it remains, so that it does not become inflamed.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For it is not eradicated by medicine, until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it makes a hard crust alone, when you do not have olive oil present, and dragon's blood also performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is suitable to apply it to them and bind them, and they are fresh wounds with their own blood, which has not changed in the air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	For if the air has already changed them through some alteration, especially when it is in the summer season, then there is no purpose in applying this powder: therefore take care of it with what we have said, so that you apply to them certain digestive ointments: or apply to them poultices made from barley flour, prepared with water and honey, until they discharge pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it happens to be a fracture of the bone with a wound, and it is small, then extract it with gestures; and I will now describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	On wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Head 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference between it and head wounds when they are simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If the nerve of the neck is injured, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no ingenuity in it, unless one tries to heal it with what causes strong stitching, such as zinc, and zeig, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm the nerves and constrict them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not apply anything cold to the wound at all: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most sublime of the membranes: and it is thus that it should be treated with gentle medicines, such as lota calcium dissolved in sweet water many times infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tuthia, when washing also with sweet water: and other mineral stones, according to this method, and humid ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then apply a suture: or bind the lips of it with small pillows.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it, until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the wound is deep, or if a sinus has formed in its lower part, where pus has already gathered, then pierce it in a more depressed place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If an artery has been cut in the wound and its blood flow has followed: then separate or ligate it, and bind it: or cauterize it, if necessity demands it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If the vertebrae of the neck or all of them are broken, and the wound is safe: then gather the lips of the skin with a suture above the cane of the neck, and do not touch the neck, but equalize it, and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointments in which there is strengthening and drying, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then investigate it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of them, or as many as you can: and what cannot be prepared, leave that until the wound putrefies, and separates and alleviates its discharge.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is fresh, then powder over it with the powder that I described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If a hole is seen in the bone of the wound, and it becomes a fistula: then take care of it with that which was mentioned in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On wounds on the shoulder blade.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is a wound from a lance or a knife: and you see its depth, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore bad air comes out of the wound, when the weak person exhales from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	What if there is no depth to it and it is fresh with its own blood? Then you should not apply powder to it at the first hour, nor bind it tightly, so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart, and kills the weak person. But put an attracting ointment on it, and loosen it during the day twice.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If you do not have an ointment at hand, then put a clean cloth on the opening of the wound, so that it absorbs what flows out from the humidity. And let the weak person sleep on the wound, so that what accumulates in it runs clear.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If already three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasm has occurred to the weak person, nor evil tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the other good dispositions of it: then know that the wound is healthy.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat it with liniments and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed the healing of it is hindered, and it always opens up, then know that a fistula has been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore treat it from its head.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a thrusting injury or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what was mentioned before about suturing, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If however it has made an impression on the bone, and a fragment has broken off from it: then probe the wound, and prepare to extract that fragment, if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If however they are not separate, then leave them alone, until the wound putrefies, for their extraction is of no benefit.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment of the other accidental wounds in the remaining limbs in treatment is the same as what we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning wounds of the abdomen and the exit of the intestines, and their treatment.
Caput LXXXVII.	Head 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruptions that occur in the belly are great, moderate, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the great ones, it happens when the intestine protrudes or a number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore their insertion is more violent and difficult, and their suture.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	It follows, therefore, that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not promptly return them to their place during the introduction itself: because they become swollen, open up, and enlarge; hence their entry becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	On account of this, therefore, a moderate disruption is better: because when there is no difficult reduction of the intestine, as it is dissimilar in these two species.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that the suture of the belly is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are suitable for the suture of the belly and for the suture of other wounds of the body; and two other sutures specifically communicate with remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper for the suture of the belly; and I will tell you each one with explanation and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, because when the wound is small and something protrudes from it out of the intestine, and it becomes difficult to reduce it; then that is on account of one of two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the smallness of the disruption, as we have said; or because there is inflammation in the intestine on account of the coldness of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is so, then it is necessary to warm it up, by applying a sponge or a moist cloth soaked in lukewarm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you boil it in water with cyperus grass, and spikenard, and embrocations, until the inflammation of the intestine is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When you make a wine in which there is astringency; and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When you see the swelling has already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which the altaea or mallow has been decocted.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through that alleyway of his, an entrance is made with a small bandage.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, the return of it is excavated after this cure, then find a small opening in the disruption, with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than cutting: and there is no need for forced cutting after necessity and failure of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	One part of it is twisted, acute, and the other part is not acute, and the extremity should not be with the subtlety of a Spatumilis, but rather more obtuse for a short time: and that is what resembles a reed, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the wound is enlarged and the intestine is ingressed, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its own proper place, if possible, because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary to make the weak patient lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head, and his chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your attention and your consideration always in this, that the part where the wound is may be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And so it is necessary to administer it thus in great wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make sure that the pious minister is present among your hands, who holds the entire disruption with his hand: and brings together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then he should touch those who follow after the suture with something after something: and this is the common method of a single suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you should receive a needle, or a number of needles secondly according to the quantity of the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let fall from the extremity of the disruption the quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the doctor: and fix a needle beyond what you introduce into it a thread in two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of the suture which is beneath the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from another part, and now you have added two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the suture: and they become four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then bind with a double thread around the instrument several times from two parts together, until they are added, the two lips of the wound, an aggregate gathering decently.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let fall the thickness of the finger also, and fix in them another needle: afterwards tie it with a thread, as you did with the first instrument.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not cease to do that with what you are skilled from instruments, until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the instruments be medium between thickness and subtlety: because subtle instruments indeed quickly fall into the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin: on account of that it is necessary that they be medium in subtlety and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the instrument be fixed in two extremities of the skin close together much: so that the flesh does not quickly fall into a wound, and the wound does not open before its consolidation, and they are not elongated also with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the extremity of the instrument, so that they do not harm the weak part during their sleep: and put pillows from cloths on every side, which hold the extremities of the instrument: and let them be, until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this type of suture with acupuncture is more convenient in small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because a single thread, or two, or about that many are sufficient for their suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second common suture is, as it were, to combine four extremities: two skin extremities and two superficial ones in one vein, with a thread that has an equal winding in subtlety and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you penetrate with the thread to these four extremities, reduce the thread from the part where you inserted it, so that the returned thread falls on the upper part of the wound: so that it is a suture, just as a suture of cloth which strings together cloths, and put in all the sutures the amount of thickness of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	Men know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I myself sewed up a wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and there was a major disruption of the wound the size of one palm: and about two palms of intestine had come out of the middle of the intestines, and there was a disruption in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I restored it afterwards, after his intestine had stood outside the wound for 23 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was therefore consolidated in a period of about 15 days: and I treated it, and he was healed: and he lived many years after that, enjoying his own dispositions.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that it could not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle, because I did not treat it with an ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor anything from medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I applied therefore an old cotton cloth over the wound twice a day, and I continually cleansed it with honey water, until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will describe two special types of suture according to the narrative of my speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, as you begin with an acute suture, and you insert a needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle penetrates into the skin, and into the flesh along the length and width of the entire body: leave the extremity of the suture on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate from the inner part to the outer part in another extremity, mirroring.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extremity, mirroring from the outer part to the inner part: and leave the extremity of the suture, which is on that side, and make the needle penetrate into another extremity from the inner part to the outer part: and make it penetrate with your penetration, as you make it penetrate in the extremity mirroring, which is on that part, until it penetrates into the entire thing.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from the same side, and sew it with the extremity that is on the other side of the suture, which is in another side, and extract the needle from the skin where it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then bring it back into the skin, and sew the extremity of the suture that is on another side, with this mirroring extremity: and extract it from the skin which is on that part, and make it one thing, and another: and make it one thing after the seam, until you have restored the entire surface according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture is that you sew the skin like those who sew pelles: so that you make one thing from one part of an extremity of the skin: and that you leave it as another thing on another side, until you complete.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of proper suture, which Galen mentioned.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This his sermon is narrated, that you sew it according to similarity, as some physicians sew them, so that they gather all the parts together to compare their natural convenience: and apply the extremity of the suture to its other extremity, and the mirroring extremity to its other extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is secondary because I will narrate it to you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary to place the scalpel's point near the extremity of the Mirach propinquum to you from the outer side, and make it penetrate to the inner part alone; and let two extremities of the skin be relaxed.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the scalpel around, and make it penetrate from the outer side to the inner part in the two extremities of the skin, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn them both around, and also make them penetrate both from the inner to the outer, in the two extremities of the Mirach, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and it is a suture which precedes reminiscence.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore the discourse of Galen also.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some have said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly is straightened with two hooks.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, to introduce into them both a single thread: and begin with the introduction of the hook, from that which is at your hand, and make it penetrate up to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew leather evenly.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when there is a disruption in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than those of other places of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the medicine for wounds is the judgment of the rest of the wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you treat a fresh wound with its own blood, before it changes to air: and you reduce the intestine, and sew it up, and adapt it: then put it on a fleshy powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already changed the wound: then put on it certain ointments which are present to you, until they make pus: and the threads fall away, and the skin is consoled, and the Mirach.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as it is the treatment of other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you do not have medicines present, then put on it immediately, from which it starts to discharge pus, an old poultice: and change it twice a day, as I instructed you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medications in various preparations, when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if the wound is situated on principal members in a lesion, then it is necessary to immerse a soft woolen cloth in tempered warm oil, or in rose oil: and put it around the area between the thighs, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If you feel pain, or stitches, or putrefaction in your intestines (for it often happens thus) then give a clyster with wine, sharp, warm and black: especially if the putrefaction has already penetrated into the intestine, and a penetrating evacuation has been made up to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is from the thick intestine is of easier healing: and what is from the subtle ones is of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine which is called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is from its veins, and their greatness, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of the proximity of its natural nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If however what proceeds from the wound is serous matter, and you collect it freshly: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If indeed the space has passed for it, and it has already become green or black: then it is necessary to bind it with a thread above the place that has been denigrated by it, so that there does not occur a flow of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in serous matter there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two hanging threads from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the attraction to it may be alleviated, and the extraction of the pus from the wound may occur, and the emission of the pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	The remembering of a wound that occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When there occurs a disruption in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it can be restored in certain men; therefore, because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a blow of a lance, and it was a wound on the right side of the stomach, and an old wound: and it became a fistula, and there came out from it a discharge, and flatulence.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I applied a treatment, until I was not confident in his healing: nor did I cease to carefully tend to it, until he was healed and the location was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the location already consolidated, I feared for the weak person, lest a bad accident should occur in his belly: and it did not happen to him from that bad accident.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in his better physical condition, eating and drinking, and evacuating, and he took a bath, and was exercised in his diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now some experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is necessary to bind it together according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, as if you receive forms of great heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place a formica (ant) one of those which have their mouth open upon the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it therefore takes hold on them, and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do that with an ant following an ant according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and sew up the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those things that remain attached to the intestines, as long as the intestine is being healed and not receiving a continuous flow of noxious material.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible to tie off the intestine also with a subtle thread: which is taken from the intestine of an animal, and attached to it after it has been inserted into a narrow point.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is that you should take the end of this thread from the intestine and remove much flesh.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie the linen thread, subtly wrapped around the end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into a narrow point, and sew the intestine to it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it into a fissure.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suture with twigs and intestine is not reliable except through the way of faith and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know that a wound which is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines, is not curable except by subtlety, nor is its healing complete.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	On the treatment of wounds and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every wound or abscess, when it becomes old and chronic, and becomes an ulcer, and does not close up, and always discharges pus, and is not separated: then it is universally called a fistula in whatever member it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And indeed a fistula is a hardened, white, filtering node, with no pain, which has a concavity like the wing of a bird: and because of that some people call it Risati, that is, a wing.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in certain hours humid, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the humidity is separated at certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this humidity is abundant, and sometimes it is scarce: and it is thick, and it is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have previously mentioned in the division, then when I spoke of wounds, that every wound which is not treated, nor does flesh grow in it, is not that except on account of a single new cause.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	There are some which are, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its malice; or because within it and above its lips is hard, dense flesh, preventing the growth of new flesh; or because there is much filth and foulness; or because the wound itself is putrid, and the matter that is applied to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its cure; or because a corrupting cadence falls upon the region, or through the property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta; in which there occurs difficult digestion of diseases, and the healing of apostemes is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and signs of them, and their cures with medicines in the division; and it is necessary here that I make you know the cure of Fistulas and Ulcers, which is done through an operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore, that a Fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For there are Fistulas that extend to large veins and arteries, or nerves, or skin; or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs; or to some of the vertebrae of the back, or to some of the compound joints of the limbs: such as the hands and feet; and there are those that wander near the principal member and its similars.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Those therefore among these Fistulas that are of this kind, are from diseases of difficult healing, and do not receive a cure, and the occupation with them is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	But if it is from Fistulas of a certain profundity that does not extend to those places which I mentioned; and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to penetrate to the knowledge of it, then take a probe made of copper or iron, if the Fistula tends according to straightness, and explore it with the same.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If there is a twisting in the fistula, then probe it with a thread of lead that has been subtly divided.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because the lead, with its own slight softness, adapts to the body and curves around the twisting.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	What if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to mark it out with a thread.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, probe through one of its openings, from its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture where you probe it, leads towards other openings, and flows out through them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then, you should carefully inquire according to which method is possible for you: so that you may know what is there, whether it is a bone, or a nerve, and the fistula is concave and far off, or near; or if it is a fistula with many openings, and stands throughout all of it, with the greatest strength of yours; with your questioning, in which you question the weak, and in the discovery of pain upon compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and accidental causes are apparent.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you stand therefore over all those true stations, then proceed to curation according to confidence: and it is, that you may consider then, if the fistula appears near, or in a healthy place far from a junction, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have told you about: then cut the fistula according to what has been previously mentioned in my narrative, and remove what is in it through filtration, and corrupt flesh, which is born in its opening from the flesh, or thelul, and similar things: and heal it, until it becomes healthy.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If the fistula is of great depth and is according to straightness: then it is necessary that you cut it as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer enwrapped licinia in sharp medicines: and introduce them up to the concavity of the fistula which you comprehended with the iron: do it several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the concavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If, however, it does not heal through that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If, therefore, the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is certified by you in that respect: then investigate it, and dissect it according to what I have narrated to you: if nothing prohibits you from a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If, therefore, the bone is disclosed to you, and there is something of decay in it, and blackness: then scrape it, until all the corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with that which puts flesh on it, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	What if it does not heal, and emits pus as it was doing: then know that you did not reach total eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, uncover again on top of it a second time, and make a precise examination of its reasoning, and cleansing of the same with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If, therefore, it is healed, that is good: and if not, then know that the corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	There is no ingenuity for you in this case, unless you abandon it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	What if the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, extract it with subtle forceps that are suitable for that.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If, however, there are many bones, then make an exact extraction of all of them, and do not leave anything out with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If, however, something opposes you from the moistures, and there is no fear of cutting into them, or error: then cut into those moistures and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If, however, you do not have the preparation to remove the bones at that time, then put on the wound what will putrefy it: and leave it, until what is around those bones putrefies from the flesh and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And take care that the wound is not consolidated.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the incision be constricted as you have divided in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Apply to the same place, if there is pain, a burnt coton soaked in sulfur mixed with oil; or a burnt coton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some other green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those parts putrefy, namely the moistures, and the bones are separated from them, their removal is alleviated, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If there is a large bone, such as the thigh bone or hip bone, and similar ones, and what has become corrupted from it is a great part: then scrape that very bone with a final scraping, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If what is corrupted in it is a great part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut into the whole thing up to the place where the corruption reaches: then treat it, until it is consolidated.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I relate to you a case that happened to a man on his thigh: so that you may put it as an example and aid on your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of about thirty years of age, to whom a pain occurred in his thigh, from a cause that was moved upon it within the body, that is, from the interior, until the matters reached the thigh and became an abscess with a large swelling: and there was no external cause for him.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	It was extended therefore with him for a long time with the error of the doctors, until the abscess opened, and many matters flowed together with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was put off, until the thigh became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: which all emitted pus, and bodily moistures.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore many doctors treated him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of healing, until I was called, and I saw his thigh, and the matters that were flowing out from those openings in a great stream: also the whole body of the man was already weakened, and his color was citrine.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I will introduce a probe through one of the openings and it will reach the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I carefully examined all the openings, and I found that they reached the wound from every part of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I made an incision, and I cut above one of the openings, until I reached a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted; for it was already decayed, blackened, putrid, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I removed what I had discovered, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I put aside what was not in the bone except that corruption which I had cut away and removed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had now eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied a dressing to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long period of time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed again, and I reached above the bone a second time, above the first discovery: and I found a continuous corruption with the bone; and I removed what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I reached above it again, and I did not cease to cut into the bone in parts, and to try to restore it: and it was not restored, until I cut out about a handful from the bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and this iteration was not necessary in the operation, and section of itself, except due to the disposition of debilitated infirmity, and scarcity of its tolerance, and my fear concerning its death: because there was a risk to it at all times from an excess of bad evacuation of syncopic flux.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	It was therefore fully healed: and a hard, fleshy growth was born in the place of the bone, and a good arrangement was made in its body, and its strength returned: and it was established in its dispositions: and it did not cause any impediment to its walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If the prominent bone in the body part is already fractured, then it is necessary to treat it in this way: take a bandage and bind it around the extremity of the prominent bone; and place a pad, which extends it upwards; and put another bandage over the first one made of thicker wool.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it over the flesh that is above the bone; and extend its extremity so that you draw the flesh downwards; and take care to detect the flesh in the place where you want to make an incision, so that the incision does not harm the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Put a splint or a plate under the bone below, because when you do that, it does not prevent the corrupted flesh from being cut.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary for the incision to be above the corrupted place for a short time, so that the corruption of the bone does not spread; and it does not appear in its appearance, and it will not lead to another incision.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, but rather continues as a whole with its part, and the corruption is in the middle of it or in its own part, then remove the flesh from all sides completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then put a splint below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	After that, make an incision from the first part where the corruption is, until the incision continues from the other part; and let the incision be according to the length of the corruption for a short time, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut through the corrupted joint, and make an incision in the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy for it except scraping away.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the comb-like structure of the hand or in the comb-like structure of the foot, then the treatment for it is very difficult indeed.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	However, it is necessary to investigate the corruption as it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And you should anoint it and cleanse it according to whatever possible disposition is for you, and with whatever craft is rightly directed towards you, when it does not cause opposition from the Vein or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you should know that the incisions and saws for cutting into these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their subtlety, and their size, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Wherefore it is necessary that you prepare an instrument of every species of operation convenient to that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And you should know that these operations signify to you the type of instrument which you need, when there is a prolonged study with you.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the methods of health; for then you will already have found through yourself that which is convenient to him from the instruments for every infirmity.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am setting forth to you at the end of this chapter a number of instruments, which you will put as examples on those which you cut into, and a test which you experience on others.
Forma Serrae.	The form of the Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of a different Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of another Saw. (same translation as before)
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the Saw depicted, is one made with skill.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper curve be sharp, made of iron; and its handle from boxwood, and let it be a well-made pyramid.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the Razor for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this Razor be according to the form of a star-shaped key: and its points be according to the form of Elschotz's fleam.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it, when they become corrupted, or the bone is large and massive.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The shape of the larger rasp.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The shape of the medium rasp.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The shape of the broad rasp.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The shape of the rasp in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The shape of the other subtle rasp.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The shape of the rasp of the curved extremity.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The shape of the small rasp, subtle for stretching.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The shape of the rasp with which bones are sawed.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The shape also of the large rasp.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a file, and the extremity is like a saw: it is shown in many places for filing bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The shape of the rasp that is suitable for filing what is perforated from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremity is triangular, and it has a sharp point.
Fit ex Indi.	It was made in India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly it is necessary that all things which we have spoken about are made from rasps, and incisors, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Concerning the cutting of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy, either from an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures and it does not respond to treatment: and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, which does not allow anything to penetrate: then it is necessary to cut into that limb up to where the corruption reaches, so that the patient may be freed from death or from the evil which is a greater defect of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that it has reached this point is that the limb turns black, until it becomes putrid: as if fire had burned it, or it had rotted after turning black: until the putrefaction is cut away up to what follows in the limb, and spreads into the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore it is necessary to make an incision with that, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the bite of certain venomous animals: such as the marine scorpion, and the viper, and the rutella, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore there is a corruption or bruise on the extremity of the finger, then cut into the finger, and do not leave space for the corrupted part to spread to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut into it from the root of the affected part, and do not leave space for the corrupted part to spread to the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it has invaded that, then cut into the arm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however the corruption has spread, and you see it surrounding the elbow: then there is certain death for the patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that from the treatment, is a quantity of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do with the foot, when corruption has invaded the toe, then cut into it at one of its nodes: and if it takes hold in the arch of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it ascends to the knee, then cut into the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	Since if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no ingenuity in that, unless abandonment and leaving the patient to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting into a limb or sawing it is to tighten a ligature below, which you wish to cut: and tighten another ligature above the location.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And the assistant stretches one ligature downwards to the lower parts: and the assistant stretches another ligature upwards to the upper parts.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures, with a spatula laid flat, until the entire flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it should be cut, or sawn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to put a linen cloth around all parts, and the saw should not touch the healthy place: and the patient may suffer additional harm, and a hot aposteme.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If however a flow of blood occurs internally while operating, then cauterize the place quickly: or apply some powders that absorb the blood to it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medication, until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded member with a suitable bandage, and care for it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I will tell you what happened to a certain man with his foot, this very thing that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What happened was that his foot became blackened, with a kind of burning that resembled fire: and the corruption first occurred on his toe, until it took over the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore, the man was freed from himself, after he saw that the corruption was spreading to his limb with its ugliness, which he found from the pain and burning: and it ceased at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed for him, that same corruption happened to him again on the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I tried to remove that excess with what I had placed on his hand from my medicines after purifying his body: but the excess did not recede, and began to spread to another finger: until the corruption began on his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called upon me to cut off his hand: and I was unwilling to do that, hoping for a retraction of that excess from me: and I also feared death itself at the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the man's strength was superior in the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he despaired of me, he returned to his own land: and he came back to me about it, because he was freed, and his whole hand was cut off: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not add this narrative, unless it should be an aid concerning that which falls out from this kind of illness: and so that it might be a signification by which it is signified, and according to what is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Of the treatment of wounds, and the quality of cleansing with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess forms in certain fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged, until it collects pus: then it bursts or perforates, and what was in it exits, leaving a vacant space as if it were a vessel; and the skin that is above it is like a thin membrane that has been stretched out; and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, neither in the mouth nor in the nerve, nor in the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus; and it is not called a Fistula. However, if its space is prolonged until it impresses corruption on one of these members, then it is called a Fistula or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is to cut away the entire skin as it revolves; and especially when it has been stretched out and made like a thin membrane; and you should be confident that it will not adhere to the place, on account of its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you think that the skin will adhere and the ultimate corruption does not follow from it as a consequence; and if there is thickness in the skin from the flesh, then treat it with suppositories; and it is, as if you were treating a Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor; then inject it with an Egyptian medicine, which is made of acetum (vinegar), oil, and zuinar (a type of resin), taking equal parts, mixed together in a vase; and they are decocted over fire until the medicine becomes red-hot; and it penetrates into the thickness of the honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what is necessary for you; and dissolve it with water and honey, and inject it into the Sinus; and close its opening, and leave the medicine in it for a period of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with pressure: do this for several days, until the Sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when you inject with water of ashes, when this medicine is not present to you: and it is, that you should take the ash of vine wood or the ash of holm oak wood; and you pour it over the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and inject with it, until you are confident that the sinus is already cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	What if the patient is not tolerating the Egyptian medicine, nor the water of ashes, then inject it with water and honey, to which something has already been mixed from crushed zuinar.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or inject it with honey and mixed wine, because of the property of honey that cleanses and washes; and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of dryness and roughness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do that several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus is already removed: then inject it with what causes flesh to grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you take from the emplaster dyafinicon; and dissolve it with rose oil and wine of astringency; or inject it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I wrote about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	What if the orifice of the sinus is narrow, in which the cannula of the injection does not fit: then enlarge it with an iron instrument for a short time; or put in that same licinium wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then bring together its lips with a suture: and allow from it a quantity in which it can be injected without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice from which pus flows is elevated to the upper parts: then dry it in the depressed place that is in it, so that the pus flows out of it downwards: because when pus is confined in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	What if it is not possible for you to dissect the sinus around the lower part of it according to your judgment: then try, so that you prepare the member with a preparation by which pus flows out easily, as it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try, so that nothing of the pus remains in it at all: and take consolidating medications which are applied to the wound, suitable for what you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them out over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such quantity that it makes contact with the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps directly into the opening of the sinus's foramen, a little more widely than the opening of the sinus itself.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread out a gentle ointment on another cloth, according to the size of the foramen: and place it over it in a position far from the opening of the sinus, so that the flow of pus is eased out of it: and do not remove the large cloth unless after several days, or about one.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	That one, however, which is over the opening of the sinus, is the one that you remove at every hour, so that what has accumulated in it from pus may come out: and so you may know, whether what flows out of it is a great deal, or a little: or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you do this repeatedly, consider the place of the sinus itself, whether the master of it feels pain in it, or if there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or if there is not an abscess in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your medication is extended in this way, and you see the material that flows out over the opening of the sinus, then you know that the sinus is already adhering, or approximating to adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth to another, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If, however, a subtle and thin pus flows out of the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are people who slow down the generation of flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If, however, a foul pus emerges from the wound after many days, then you will know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If, therefore, the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its process is prolonged, then add in the desiccation of medicines, which make physicians truly effective, so that they may be medicines in their humid substance and in their dry virtue: such as the dyafinicon ointment, when an excessive addition from zegi is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the most ultimate goal of treatment, it is to receive the dyafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and then apply it to the old wine equal in substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it thusly.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now make something similar to this action, when you do not have the dyafinicon ointment at hand, but rather, when you prepare it, until it thickens, and use it thus.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and galbanum: grind all of it, and powder it over the honey while it is over the flame.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then spread it over the linen cloth, and bind it over the sinus: and mix with honey which you have prepared, until it thickens: and powder over it the spices, and put it on the linen cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when it is administered with aristolochia longa, and the roots of heavenly lily, and it is a lily: and flour of herb, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them as simples, or aggregates, grind them, and strain them: and powder over the honey which I have narrated, and use it thus.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	What if the process of the sinus is prolonged, and it does not heal with this treatment: then you will know that there is corruption deep within it: or now it makes an impression on the bones, or in the remaining hard members, or in the ligaments: then treat it with a fistula treatment, according to what has been previously mentioned.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	About the treatment of wounds on the fingers and toenails, and the cutting into of a digit.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A panaritium is an abscess that grows under the toenail of the hand or foot, and perhaps it grows on the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore its matter is prolonged and neglected in its treatment, and it becomes an abscess with a hot apostema; or it becomes corrupted and discharges pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole finger, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until there is a foul smell: and the extremity of the finger becomes thick, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you treat it, with what we said earlier in the division, and your treatment is not effective; then it is necessary to cut away with an iron all the excess flesh that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound afterwards.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cauterization is a very helpful remedy indeed.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty spaces of the nail are pressing on the flesh inside, and they start to sting it, and hurt it: then it is necessary to put a subtle file under the angle of the nail that stings the flesh, and push it upwards; and cut away the flesh with ease, and apply what remains of the flesh from burning medicines, corroding, until everything is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however the corruption has already spread to the bone, then it is necessary to cut into that bone and extract it: for it will never be healed as long as the corrupted bone remains.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	What if you see corrosion and corruption advancing on the finger, then cut it off at one of the nodes, according to what has been mentioned above.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat him, until he is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, a nail injury or a blow occurs, and there is intense pain in that case, then it is necessary to bleed the patient at the beginning.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp Scalpel's edge, crossing from above to below.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And beware, lest the cutting reaches the flesh that is beneath the nail, for you will cause a severe pain to occur through that to the patient, and it will be a cause of inflammation of the added flesh at that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the area with what alleviates pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	However, an extra finger which is born on some people's hands is entirely fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail on it: and some of them grow from the root of the joint, or its growth is in certain knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, that which grows on certain knots of the finger does not move: and that which grows near the joint of the finger perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, that which is fleshy from those, its cutting is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, to cut it off at its root with a broad Scalpel.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But that whose growth is at the root of the joint, its treatment is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, refrain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	On the other hand, that which grows on the finger near the last knots, then it is necessary to cut into the flesh first with a round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw through the bone with one of those suitable saws for that purpose.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat him, until he is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	Moreover, the consolidation that occurs on the fingers is often due to an innate defect of man, that is, born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	It is necessary therefore that you divide that consolidation, until the digits return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a strip of cloth soaked in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate too quickly and separate from each other; or place between them a thin sheet of lead, until the location is consolidated as needed.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if a consolidation occurs on certain digits with the palm, then divide that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	On the Incision of Veins.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Veins are twisted, thick, full of superfluous melancholic fluids which occur in many parts of the body; and their most frequent occurrence is in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel, labor, and carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	It is necessary therefore to administer a purging of the body from black bile many times with strong purging.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then perform bloodletting on the patient's basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of them is indeed with iron, and it is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One method is that they be cut, and black blood be extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is to evacuate the vein, and extract everything.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section of it is indeed according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First, bathe the leg with hot water abundantly, until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the weak leg from the upper part of its hip to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then divide the vein at one place, or two, or three sections widely.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then evacuate, that is, extract the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and it is necessary to perform bloodletting on the weak one first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the nail with a fire until it draws out a sufficient quantity of blood which you see is enough and which the virtue of the weak part can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it: and order him to abstain from foods that generate black bile; and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and it does not harm the weak part.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The evacuation of it is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Scrape the affected area, if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then put it in a bath: or immerse it in its own basin with hot water, until it becomes red and the veins overflow: or exercise strong massage, if there is no present bath, until the member becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin directly over the vein's section along its length: or at the end of it near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and excavate the vein from every part, until it becomes apparent to the sense: and it is at its appearance, that you see it turn from redness to blackness.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it emerges from the skin, you see it white as if it were a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce the scalpel underneath it, until when it is elevated and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a blunt hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another section near that section, three fingers' breadth away.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then excavate the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it becomes apparent.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then elevate it with scalpels as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry another section, or several sections, if it is necessary for that.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then elevate and incise the same at the last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then extract it to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that, until you extract it from the section which is superior, or higher than all sections, until when it emerges whole; then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you to extract and elevate, then insert a strong double thread, and tie it, and extract it; or insert under the Radius; and revolve your hand to every part, until it emerges.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful, lest it is cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it will be difficult for you to elevate it greatly, and it will become inflamed above the weak part from that injury.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have extracted it whole, then put on the wounded place a soaked linen cloth in wine and rose oil, or oil; and take care of it, until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted, having a twisted condition where there is an involution to the parts, and it is not as we have said according to rectitude: then it is necessary to find it on every part of its twistedness, and the place of its involution.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks, until you elevate it whole; and be careful at your section above it lest you cut the vein, or wound; for it will be difficult for you to elevate, or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Preserve therefore your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The method of treating a wounded vein so that it heals.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The method of hooks for the blind.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not curved like the other hooks, nor is it of acute extremity, so as not to wound the vein; and it is of coarse flexibility, gentle: because if it were subtle, it would cut the vein by its subtlety; indeed, there is a superfluous coarseness in it, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the femoral vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot and dry lands, such as those of Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry and hot lands with little tenderness, that is, in which neither herb nor tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the thighs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation indeed is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just as it happens within the bodies of snakes and worms called ascarides, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And a sign of the inception of this vein is that which occurs in the thigh as an intense inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place is sewn up.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from that place of sewing, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore the extremity of it appears from there, then it is necessary to apply a wrapping of plaster over that fragment of lead, whose weight is one dirham and two nodules; and suspend the lead from the thigh.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever something emerges from there to the outside, wrap it in lead, and nodulate it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged too much, then cut off a part of it, and wrap up the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at the root until it has emerged completely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it becomes constricted, and grows into the flesh; and it causes an abscess to occur, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary to handle it gently and extract it gradually, until it emerges from its very end, and nothing of it remains in the body; and indeed this vein emerges in some people which is five palms and ten units long.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has reached me, for it had gone out from a man twenty palms long.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it is cut off during the time of your treatment: then introduce a radish into its opening, and perforate it with a long opening, along with the body, until everything that is in it from the material is evacuated; and administer putrefaction to the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat the post-operative swelling.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein indeed has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself; and many openings belong to it, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Treat it therefore, as we have said in the division, and with what has been mentioned beforehand.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	About the excision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called "Cow's Disease".
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is named "Cow's Disease" in certain lands among us; because it often affects cows, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it wanders throughout the entire body, ascending and descending; and it is perceived by sensation during its movement from limb to limb, until it bursts out wherever it bursts out on the skin's surface, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putridity of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and snakes occur, that is, earthworms, and roundworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they are feared because of their evil nature.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it wanders in the body and rises to the head, and reaches a certain place: then perhaps it appears there, and emerges, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When, therefore, you want to cure it, and extract it, then it does not happen unless through its movement and the appearance of its sensation.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary, therefore, to bind what is above it, and what is beneath it with a strong constricting bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then sew above it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it is deeply rooted in the flesh, and you do not find it: then apply a cautery with fire to the place, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And what is feared more is the corruption of it, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If you see that it has already spread to the head near the eye, then tighten a good stricture under it above the eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick person should be purified of his bodily corruption with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And he should beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the surgical treatment for Nakir disease.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 145.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called Nakir in our land, and it is a pain that occurs in certain members, then it moves from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I have indeed seen it myself, according to what I relate to you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she showed me her arm, and I saw a small swelling on the vein of the arm's cord.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained for one hour, I saw a swelling increase with a tender movement, as if it were an ascending worm, going up to her shoulder more quickly than possible: so that it was like living silver, when it flowed from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Then the pain receded from that place, and settled in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for an hour, and it flowed into the rest of the body, until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it had returned throughout her whole body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed therefore at the swiftness of its change from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I had indeed never seen this disease with my own eyes in this manner before.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I had seen many who experienced pain moving from member to member, and I did not see it with my own eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it is anything other than what is because of that, which a woman was among those who are affected by the dryness of their bodily vessels, from which it appears that the change in her veins has been perceived.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary, so that they do not appear according to this reasoning in those who are delicate and have humid bodies, of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you apply treatment to it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to your eye as we have said, then press above it, and below it quickly: and cut above it, until the confined veins are released: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with bodily exercise, and with what expels the veins' windiness, and cleanse them with foul-smelling pills, and pills of serpent's root, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of arrowheads.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 46.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrowheads are differentiated according to their own kinds and according to the places in which they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is indeed such that some of them have large points, and small ones; and are concave, and rough.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And some of them have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And some of them have tongues (or flanges).
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And some of them have stars (or star-shaped tips).
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those indeed which are according to the limbs in which they fall, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or indeed the limbs are from principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls in one of these members, and death signs appear to you, which I will narrate to you afterwards, then it is necessary that you hasten the extraction of that arrowhead from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs are not apparent to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then extract it, and cure the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when an arrow falls on the brain, and penetrates the bone, and exits with a hiss that is above the brain, it is because bad accidents occur from it, such as swooning, and darkness, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasms, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood flows out from the nostrils or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And a white, cloudy fluid similar to pus flows out from the place of the wound.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there emerges from it something like the decay of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then desist from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not emerge.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls on the heart are: that it is near the left nipple; and one feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in a empty thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow makes a movement similar to the pulse's movement; and black blood flows out from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And there follows that numbness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death is approaching without doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the ejection of foamy blood from the wound; and the parts that follow the neck become inflamed, and the color of the patient changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a great, high-pitched spirit; and he seeks to attract cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	For if the arrow falls on the diaphragm, which is in the chest; then it is near the small ribs; and there occurs a great shortness of breath with vehement pain, with sighing; and all the members of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if a dart falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested will come out of the wound along with food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if a dart falls into the belly and is stuck in it: something foul comes out of the wound, or pus, or intestine which is already disrupted.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is no hope therefore of curing it, nor of extracting the dart.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If a dart falls into the bladder and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and there is strong pain over the weak spot: then you should know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and upper arm bone, and vertebrae of the back, and shoulder, and hip, and leg, and similar parts from the limbs are saved according to many different arrangements: when a dart does not find an artery or nerve: and it is not a poisonous dart.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen about the nature of these darts, so that you may understand it through this about your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	What is, because a certain man's dart fell into the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore extracted it from the other side, beneath the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another dart from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid: and the dart was already hidden, and I did not succeed in getting it out except for its small end, with which it adhered to his eyelid: and it was a large dart from the Turkish bows, with a smooth iron, on which there were no notches.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healed, and no evil accident occurred to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another dart from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And there was an Arab arrow, and it is that which has its points.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I cut above it between the two ribs, and it had already sunk into his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I operated skilfully with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed for him, and nothing of his symptoms had changed, I operated on the arrow; and I applied my ingenuity to it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no bad accident befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man on whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound was consolidated around it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman on whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound was consolidated around it, and the arrow remained inside: and nothing of her symptoms changed, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, on whom an arrow had fallen into his face: and the wound was consolidated, and it remained, not causing him much pain: and there were many similar cases like these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from the Prince's forehead, which had fallen into his nose, and had already deviated to the right side for a short time: and the entire arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called therefore to his cure after the accident of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the wound of the arrow strongly constricted.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I probed it therefore with a subtle instrument, and I did not feel it: and indeed he was finding a puncture and pain under his right armpit.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	So I spare what was that point of exit from the extremity of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I applied a plaster to the place with a plaster in which there was an attractive and digestive power, trusting in myself that the place would apostematize and show me the sign of the arrow, so I might touch it: and nothing happened at the place, indicating that the arrow had not touched the spot.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I treated it continuously with a plaster for many days, and nothing happened, and the wound healed in the meantime. And he remained weak from the extraction of that splinter for some days, until he felt the arrow on a certain day inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I therefore put a sharp corrosive medicine on the wound for many days, until it was opened up: and when I probed it, I felt the subtle extremity of the arrowhead that was stuck in the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine, until the extremity of the arrowhead appeared visibly to us: and it passed with me for a space of time around four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound had grown larger, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move them, and it did not obey to come out: then I did not cease to cleverly try and contrive over it with various contrivances, until I succeeded in extracting it on a certain day with well-made forceps, according to the shape of their ends, as described in the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I therefore restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and he was healed to full health: and nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of extracting a certain arrowhead, so that you may put that rule and significance on what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not understood with narration, nor does the book comprehend it, and the skilled craftsman compares a little over much; and with what is present, over what is absent; and he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the extraneous descriptions of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrowheads do not come out from the members in which they are fixed, unless according to two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place into which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite part of another.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out from where it entered, or is an arrowhead proceeding into a fleshy place: and it is attracted, and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	What if it does not obey at the time of exit from the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it for some days, until the flesh that is around it putrefies, and its attraction is alleviated, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in a bone, and does not obey you at the time of exit, then leave it for some days as well; and try it with attraction and motion every day, until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	What if it does not obey you at the time of exit after days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrowhead in that bone on every side with a subtle trephine, until the arrowheads are amplified.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If the arrowhead is fixed in a bone of the head, and has already proceeded into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those accidents which I mentioned appear from the weakness: then abstain from attracting the arrowhead, and leave it, until its being is equalized after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrowhead reaches the sieve-like (bone), then death will not be prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrowhead is not fixed, unless only in a bony body, and does not penetrate up to the sieve-like (bone): and he remains weak for some days, and none of those accidents happen to him: then use your ingenuity in attracting the arrowhead and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If it is fixed and does not obey you for attraction, then administer the trephine around the arrowhead, as I have described to you; afterwards cure the place until it is healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If the arrowhead has already been hidden in a place of the body and is concealed and hidden from the senses, then probe it with a tent.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then attract it with certain instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot get above it, due to the constriction of the wound, and due to the length of the arrowhead in the depth; and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein: then probe above it until the wound is enlarged, and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	What if there are auricles that hold it, then liberate the fixed flesh from them on every side, with all the ingenuity you can, and devices, if you cannot get above the eversion of the flesh in the fracture of the auricles, and their contortion, until it is freed.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of the arrowhead, in whatever place it is, then use the contortion of your hand, with forceps on all parts, until you make it emerge: and be subtle with utmost subtlety, lest the arrowhead breaks, and its attraction becomes difficult for you, and its very extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	What if you cannot get above it at one hour, then leave it for some days, until what is around it putrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then touch it again: for the tumor will be alleviated; if indeed the counterflow of blood makes an opposition to you, then administer what we said about the treatment in its chapter: and preserve your strength from incision of the vein, or nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer ingenuity in every way possible to extract the arrowhead: and let it be with facility, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I have described to you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you operate with the arrow-shaped instrument, so that the wounded person may be secondarily shaped according to the figure which he had at the time of the wound inflicted by the arrow.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If however it is not possible for you to do that, then administer what is possible for you according to the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow which emerges from the opposite part of the other, or already proceeds from it to the exterior; or it makes a gibbosity on the extremity of the wound through the sense of the superior part of the adjacent skin, and you see it prominent: therefore cut above it, and let the incision be according to the quantity which the forceps can grasp.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it out: for it will be easy to extract it afterwards.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow head becomes fixed in the bone and enlarges itself; then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not, leave it for some days: then try again, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the wooden part of the arrow is in it, then push it out with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If the wooden part has fallen off, and you are unable to administer an impulse: then introduce into it a concave instrument, so that its concavity may enter into the tail of the arrow: then push it out with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the arrow head is concave, then push it out with an instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow head is extracted through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to concave the entire flesh where the venom is, if that is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with what is suitable for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side; and it is near to what you touch with your finger, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and be careful about the incision of a vein, or nerve, and extract it.

Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the method of forceps, with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	They are like bird's beaks, made as if iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And they are made from them into many kinds, large, small, and medium, according to the quantity of the arrow's magnitude, and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of a pushing forceps.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of a pushing straight forceps.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is a straight extremity like a rod, so that its entrance is alleviated into the concave arrow, and it is pushed with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This extremity of the pushing forceps is concave like a bird's feather: so that the entrance of the arrow is alleviated into it and its impulse.

¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	About the venesection of the vein under the tongue after the cephalic venesection.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	There are two veins under the tongue that require venesection: it is because the cephalic venesection is for prefactions that are in the throat and for the weakness of the uvula, and the weaknesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	About the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins that are venesected in the elbow are those in which the practice of venesection has been established in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And the venesection of them is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a broad and blunt phlebotome, or by shaving to a subtle decline, or by cutting with a razor-like phlebotome, and this is the method of Al-NSR.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Al-NSR is, which is suitable for the section.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And of them there are broad and subtle species according to the amplitude of the veins and their stricture. The form of the myrtle-shaped phlebotome is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave, full, protruding, apparent, and thick veins, and those that contain gross, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotome is of lesser width and more subtle at the extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for phlebotomy of fine veins, which contain subtle, citrus-colored blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On the Phlebotomy of Royal Veins.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The royal one, however, which is one of these three veins for phlebotomy, is a help.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it extracts blood from the diseased parts, which are under the jaw and neck, following the chest, and stomach; and it is suitable for the phlebotomist with his phlebotomy, so that he may beware, and be anxious about the fear of it, because under it there is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he errs, and adds to the piercing of the phlebotomy, he will cut into that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Wherefore it is necessary not to perform phlebotomy with a piercing phlebotomist; rather, he should be gentle with the Al-nesil (scalpel).
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	Because if the royal vein does not appear in a clear and manifest way, then it is necessary to seek another, and to transfer to another, or to explore some other branch of it; or to perform phlebotomy in place of it, the Funem (vein) of the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For that is clear, and he should cut it with the Al-nesil phlebotomy, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you wish to perform phlebotomy on the same one, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that you should touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with a cautery, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein at the curved section with the Al-nesil phlebotomy, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware that the puncture does not slip through the space to the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that, as you bind the ligature, an inflammation appears at the place which you marked with a cautery, then that inflammation is an inflammation of the artery: therefore, it is necessary to avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood in a phlebotomy that is salty, like the urine of a child, and it is subtle, red, then you will know that it is from an arterial bleeding.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then press down firmly, and place your finger on the lengthy space, then lift your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If the blood is then let out (for it is often let out), then bind the arm, and loosen it: and beware lest the weak person be moved by its motion: and let it be above his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for some days, until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood does not flow out, and it overcomes you: and there is no present remedy for you at that moment, then cut into the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For the extremities are constricted, and the blood flows out.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of cloth, and bind it: take one half, and tie it over the place of the stricture of the vein, with a ligature and cotton wool until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood flows out, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then treat it with that which preceded the memory of the place of the powder of blood flow: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small place of the wound and the possibility of a ligature from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Of the Phlebotomy of the Dark Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The phlebotomy of the Dark Vein is beneficial, because it draws blood from the superior part of the head and the inferior part of the body: therefore, since it is composed of the branch of the Basilic vein and the branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the phlebotomist to be above fear from his phlebotomy, for beneath it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore an addition is made to the puncture of phlebotomy, and a nerve is found, there occurs in it numbness, and difficult is its healing, and perhaps it will not be fully healed.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the senses.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If however it is hidden in certain men, and is subtle, and does not show itself: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy where the phlebotomists make an incision with Al Nesil, and divide the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	What if a vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Concerning the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is beneficial, because it attracts blood from the head and brings relief to the sufferings of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein particularly, if you wish, to phlebotomize it by pricking with an oily phlebotome or a myrtle phlebotome: because it is the most healthy of all veins, since there is no underlying artery, nor nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However it is fitting for you to proceed with phlebotomy, so that you divide only the skin of the head with a gentle touch, and seek a smoother spot: and it does not harm if it is not found with the first strike, so that it may be repeated over it several times with phlebotomy.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However perhaps an abscess forms in certain men when they are not phlebotomized at the first strike, but that abscess does not harm them in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Concerning the usefulness of Phlebotomy and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of Phlebotomy, and its accidents resulting from it, in whose correction it is necessary for you to think.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, it is of this that you ought to know, that phlebotomy is not administered unless for the conservation of health, and its perseverance, and caution against the advent of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And let there be bloodletting on one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Fusca, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And let there be bloodletting at the beginning of spring, on a fast day, in the morning, and in summer, and autumn, and winter after digestion, when signs of repletion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let there be bloodletting on the first day or on the third day, after three hours have passed.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Bloodletting that is administered to the sick, does not have a determined hour: but when convenience and necessity call for it, at night, or day, and in every hour, and in every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not fitting that bloodletting should be performed on children, until they are fourteen years old.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should pregnant women be bloodletted, unless from the fourth month to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should the old be bloodletted, who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When therefore someone wishes to be bloodletted for any reason whatsoever: it is fitting that they should cleanse their intestines beforehand with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained dung in them: so that the veins may not draw out noxious putridities from the intestines during bloodletting, which are harmful to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should the patient be full of loathsome nausea, nor drunk, nor evacuating from a hangover, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor one who is weak with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And bloodletting is to be avoided after colic passion, and vomiting, and flux of the stomach, and excessive intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and wakefulness, and fasting, and everything that dissolves the virtue from the bodily or animal strength.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick from food and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then a warm bath is introduced, if it does not prohibit something else; or some exercise is used, so that the blood is subtly loosened.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And apply phlebotomy to his chest, around the third day, as we have said; and take care that his chest is freed from all bad animal influences on that day: such as anxiety, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excessive flow, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let his own people make present the things that are useful with the customary use of aromatics, and perfumes, and tripping and similar things in proportion to possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion, which is higher than the cushion of the one to be phlebotomized: afterwards he draws out his arm, and rubs it with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he tightens the ligament with a bandage, and wraps it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the binding be moderate, because when the binding is unequal, or excessive in the binding, then it prevents the flow of blood: or if it is too loose, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the binding it is necessary to rub the hands of the one to be phlebotomized together gently, until the veins become inflated and are declared to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist wipes the phlebotomy site with a little oil, in the ancient proper way.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then let him place his index finger of the left hand on that vein under the spot where he wants to perform phlebotomy, gently: so that the vein does not flee and is struck with percussion.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because it is like a fleeing cord when you find it, as if at phlebotomy: and of them there is one that is full of windiness: and when you place the phlebotomy on it, it contracts under the phlebotomy, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein: and if he opens it, it is tight: therefore for this reason it is necessary to make the phlebotomist firm, and to be solicitous in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then the scalpel is placed.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore a vein is opened from one side, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then the other vein under that place is tried a little, or above it with haste: if the place does not become inflamed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	What if it becomes inflamed, or the patient grows weak, then leave him for a day, or two days: and do not bind the dressing tightly.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps indeed it will attract a warm abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should a bath be entered.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then the scalpel is repeated, if it is loved.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	What if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly: and then as not to let out from the blood a quantity that you wish: then repeat the scalpel in the same opening, following the straightness, and add a little in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do that with haste, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place is in many men a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat anything on top of it at all, for nothing excuses something in your regard.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put on top of it something from the sediment of oil: because it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the sediment of oil in all your bloodlettings, where the bloodletters prohibit the flow of blood: and they make it, that is, the tyrical and sagzenical treatments, when it is put on one of them over the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood is subtly purified and resolved, when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	What if a great abscess happens at the place of the bloodletting, for it often happens, especially to those who are not bloodletted except on that side, or is the opening of the vein small, then prepare and put on the place a sponge infused in water and salt, warmed for a little while: and bind it for one hour: because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is suitable to make that opening after the blood has flowed out from the same vein, with its own covering, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If something black or greenish remains in the place after several days, it does not harm: and if you wish, apply to it a solution of aloe, or myrrh, or something from the juice of mint, that is, of calendula or similar.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And indeed it often happens that abscesses and swellings occur at the site of bloodletting according to the method of Basil.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Put your hand therefore upon it, and then if you find softness under your pressure upon it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Take heed therefore, to apply to it something from what we have mentioned.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood flows out from the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place may be tightened up.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is suitable to extract from each person a certain amount of blood according to the quantity of his strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color-changing above the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it becomes red, and similarly if you see it as thick, then let it be thinned out until it is refined. And similarly if it is acute, until its acuteness is relieved.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is suitable for one who is full, strong, and needs the extraction of blood twice, to amplify the bloodletting of the vein, and let the phlebotomist be skilled. And in one who is weak, let it be the opposite of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is suitable to extract it in the veins, and that the opening be narrow. And what is better administered in the bloodletting of the vein is a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is healthy for the flow of blood, and from an incision in the vein: and it is more praiseworthy, and healthier than bloodletting by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it is customary to arrive at syncopis through bloodletting, it is necessary that they eat before bloodletting a moderate amount of food infused with pomegranate water or rose water, if they are overheated: and let them extract from the blood in three or four veins.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if they have a cold complexion, then let them take before bloodletting bread infused with warm syrup of honey, or in syrup made from honey and aromatic spices, or in syrup fragrant with aromatics.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	Because if syncopis occurs through bloodletting, and it is the cause of much blood flowing out: then it is necessary that they take in drink water of meat, and subtle fragrant syrup: and let them use aromatics with galangal, and anoint their chest with those: and let them use the remaining things we mentioned in the division on syncopis from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wants to evacuate their arm and release their blood a second time: it is necessary for him whose bloodletting is due to much evacuation, and his strength is weak, that he releases blood little by little according to the quantity of his strength on continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wants to evacuate their arm and release their blood a second time, and his body is strong: then let him do that after seven hours or nine hours from his first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wants to attract blood from their body to the opposite part to which it declines: it is necessary that they be evacuated on the second day or the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whom there is already much heated blood in their body, and it becomes sharp, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary that blood exit from them in one vein, and a great quantity be extracted from them: and the opening is widened until syncopis occurs: after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting: and put your hand on their pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not occur in place of syncopis.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For many times it happens that, when the phlebotomist is ignorant and becomes neglectful.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not suitable when you want to release the arm, and release the second blood, since the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, so that it bursts out upon it with vehemence, and the curvature extends quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a bad thing, indeed to omit it, until it is phlebotomized for the second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove it with the acuteness of phlebotomy that which is coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place upon it something salty dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place upon it something from tyriaca alfaroch or sagzenea, and apply gentle pressure, until the blood flows out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed the vein has become apostematous, then omit it, and do not touch it, until the apostema settles.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	What if necessity provokes the need to release blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it at that place, or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The veins of the arm are phlebotomized at the place of the Fuscae and Basilicae, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of that phlebotomy is, that it inserts a weak hand into warm water, until it becomes red-hot, and the veins appear manifestly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then bind above it with a ligature of moderate constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then make a second phlebotomy across the width gradually, not latitudinally, nor along the length; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be one that you make above the joint of the hand, just for a short time.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	What if the exit of blood is prohibited, then put your hand in warm water, and let the blood flow into the water, until you achieve your necessity.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If you are operating during the summer days, then you should wash your hands repeatedly in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed the flow of blood is greatly promoted by warm water at the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And bleeding from this vein is healthier for all veins, since there is no pulsating artery beneath it, nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Bleeding from the vein of the right hand at the salvation of the wrist is beneficial for liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of that bleeding is such that you should bind the wrist with a ligature or your hand, after you have inserted it into warm water, until the vein becomes swollen and is plainly felt.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then you should open the vein by making a transverse incision.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful, lest you ultimately harm your hand with the bleeding instrument.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For beneath it are the naked nerves of the fingers, stripped of their flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return your hand to warm water, and allow the blood to flow out in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein, and its flow will be blocked.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have extracted the necessary amount from the blood, then apply oil and salt to the vein: so that it does not congeal too quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, it is necessary to do the same with every constricted branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The benefit of bleeding from the left hand is that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen; and do the same in this bleeding as you did in the second, equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit of bleeding from the Saphena vein is that it is for diseases which are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menstruation, and kidney weaknesses, and old sores on the hips and thighs, and similar afflictions.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of his phlebotomy is that he inserts his ailing foot into warm water and makes friction on it until the veins overflow, and then binds above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the place of the veins is at the heel, appearing opposite the thumb, and they branch out from it into many ramifications on the surface of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, phlebotomy is performed on its larger branch, or at the heel in its collection, because it is better and more healthful.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	Because if phlebotomy is performed on the surface of the foot, then it should be cautious of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And put your phlebotomy there where you phlebotomize it crosswise, as if you want to cut into it, and let the phlebotomist be skilled.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the flow of blood is prohibited, then soak his foot in warm water and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	Because if the phlebotomist makes an error in the first instance, then he should repeat it with phlebotomy at the upper parts for a short time, for the place is healthy and you do not fear evil from it when you are cautious of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the Saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The place of the Sciatic veins, as we said, is at the heel on the outer side of the ankle.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of his phlebotomy is to alleviate pain in the ankle, when it is due to warm blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of his phlebotomy is that he enters into a warm bath, and fasts; and binds his leg from the side of the ankle up to the heel with four fingers, with a subtle and long thread: for it does not appear except on account of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then the phlebotomy is performed according to whatever method is possible for you, or crosswise; and it is better, either to cut into it with an incision, or to separate it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	The location of it is more hidden, and it itself is deeply concealed in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it, and it does not appear to the sense at all; then make an incision on some branch of it, and it is that which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ankle; and be cautious of the nerve, and make flow from the blood a quantity as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the constriction, and place a linen cloth over the site of the incision, and bind the area tightly.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	You will heal quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Of the treatment by cupping, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 48.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cupping glasses are made from horns, and from copper, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And cupping is done in two ways indeed.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification and bloodletting; and the other is cupping without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this cupping which is without scarification, is in two modes.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the cuppings which are administered with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, and they are two layers of the neck from both sides together; and the cupping of the mind, and it is under the jawbone in the lower jaw; and the cupping of the two spatulas; and the cupping of Alachosos above the end of the tailbone; and the cupping of the two fossae, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and the cupping of the two thighs; and the cupping of the two hips.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed the cupping does not extract blood from you through the small scattered veins in the flesh, and because of that, no virtue falls out from them, just as it is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	It is not fitting to administer a treatment with fire or without fire for any ailment that arises from excess, until the whole body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	Because if necessity provokes ventilation due to ailment or because of habit, we administer it at every hour, at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle, and whenever the time may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	Because it is so, since there are people who, when the blood increases in them, need its extraction through ventilation, and find heaviness in their head, and swoon.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And there are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And there are those who find itchiness on their face and forehead, and darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And there are those who scratch the place of their ventilation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And there are those whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And there are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth, or their tongue becomes putrid and spits out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And there are those whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And there are those who see in their sleep blood and redness, and wounds, and sores, and things similar to these.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something of these, and it is specifically in the middle third of the month, we prescribe then that ventilation should be done, after two or three hours have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The instrument of ventilation of the neck is this: because it contributes to heaviness in the head and what is poured out to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is fitting that it should be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this indeed is ventilation in place of cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted that one should use it who is of a cold complexion, or in whom there is a fluxion.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that, it is not suitable for those old people to be treated with those cold afflictions on their heads.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Whoever, however, makes a persistent effort over it, will generate upon himself oblivion.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of that, it is suitable to warn the Surgeon, so that he may put his hand with a gentle touch at first towards the lower areas, fearing the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosatio or Alkehel is the place of phlebotomy of Fuscae and phlebotomy of Basilicae, and because of that it brings about shortness of breath and constriction of the windpipe, and fissure of the instrument of breathing, and coughing, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is suitable to apply the Ventosa Alkehel gently, because if it is placed below, it generates debility in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosatio indeed is alhagdahim, which brings about painful accidental injuries to the head, and obtalmia, and hemicrania, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is the place of phlebotomy of Basilicae.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is suitable to warn the Surgeon, not to press his hand with a scarification: so that he may not cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Ventosatio under the chin, however, brings about ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar afflictions from those diseases which are in the mouth: and it stands in place of phlebotomy of alieherich, which are on both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Ventosatio of the spatula shape brings about a tendency to alchafacham, which is caused by the accumulation and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Ventosatio indeed of the internal parts of two veins, brings about an aid to phlebotomy of three veins, Basilicae, Fuscae, and Cephalicae: because it itself attracts blood from all those tiny veins which are in the flesh; and those tiny veins attract from other thicker veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary to be cautious with the scalpel, lest it proceed too far in the incision: because the location is deprived of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The scalpel, however, which is used to make incisions on the anus, is useful for hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary to be cautious with the scalpel, that it should be large and made of iron: because the location needs a strong incision, and perhaps the subtle veins would be torn apart; and a large scarification would be made by the large incision.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The scalpel, however, diminishes the thighs by a manifest diminution: because they attract blood from the entire body, and contribute to old pains in the kidneys, bladder, and uterus; they provoke menstrual flow, and contribute to bothor, and to ademenul; and they take the place of phlebotomy of the two saphena veins, and of the crab-like [veins].
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they greatly weaken the body, and cause fainting to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the phlebotomy of the crab-like veins is closely related to the phlebotomy of the two thighs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the scalpel is, that you should place the scalpel in the first empty space, and apply a tempered suction: and do not prolong the position of the scalpel, but place it quickly, and remove it quickly, so that the humors flow to the place of arrival equally: and do not cease to repeat this and continue, until you see the location now red and inflamed, and appears with a reddening of blood: then therefore incise, and apply suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of the body.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who has a tender flesh, with rare pores, it is necessary to incise him only once, no more: so that the location does not become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And beware of the scalpel, lest it amplify the incision, and make it too deep: and moderate the suction with ease, and quickness, and gentle movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	What if there is a thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first instance, indeed, the way is opened up by subtle refinement of the blood, and its purification; and in the second instance, a thorough and exquisite extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is very foul, then let there be a third scarification: that the ultimate may follow.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or for a short time, one scarification is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	What if we wish to extract much blood, we perform multiple scarifications with numerous scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to perform a deep scarification; and the boundary of equal measurement in scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which needs to be administered from oils at the position of Veins, and what is cautious in vein treatment.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that case where the skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are constricted, it is necessary to anoint the Veins with open, softening, resolving oils: if it is in summer time, such as oil of almonds, or violet oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from cucumber seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in winter time, then oil of narcissus, or oil from lily, or oil of chamomile, or sarpatonin; and similar to these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If the surplus is thick and cold, then let the oil be bitter, or oil from balsamite, or oil of almonds, or oil of anetine; and similar to these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the vein treatment is of large pores, tender flesh: then it is necessary to prohibit the use of oil, and it is necessary for them to wash the Veins with rose water after the vein treatment, or with cold water, or with sun-heated water, or with cucumber water, or with portulaca water; and similarly to these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	That person whose blood is of much humidity, should be purged with vinegar and myrtle water, and sumac: and similarly to them.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But those whose excesses are thick, should be purged with their vinegar and old wine, or with samascus water, or anethum decoction, or chamomile: and similarly to them.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is fitting that purging should be done in a bath, or in the steam of a bath, or it is fitting that it should be administered after exiting the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not fitting that someone should sleep after purging.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that one who is to be purged or blood-letted beforehand should be governed?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that it is fitting to consider first: then if one who is to be purged or blood-letted is choleric, and they overcome their blood with bitterness and inflammation: then it is fitting to receive cooling things, such as granated unguent: and also endivia with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and juleb: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And let his food be chicken, and old beef or goat meat, and seasoned dishes with wild herbs: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And he whose constitution is cold, it is fitting to take in a drink a syrup of honey, or of elm, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let him take a fragrant wine, which is between old and new: and let him be advised to use a small amount of food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And let his food be chicken, and cane berries: and sparrows, that is, small birds: and young pigeons should be sufficient for him.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is fitting that the drink of the day of purging and blood-letting be more than food: and it is fitting that there should be given in a drink to certain people at tyriaca hour alfaroch, or medicine from musk, that is, muscat, or alexithe before purging: and before blood-letting, or after: so that the principal members may be comforted, and the blood may be subtly purified.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not suitable that they take it in a warm potion.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	About wounds without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Wounds which are without scarification are those that are situated on the chest, and spleen, and hip, and on the navel, and kidney area, and groin: because these members do not tolerate scarification upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And there is no search through them, unless an attraction occurs from a bloody member to a member: just as we set a wound on the breasts in an abundance of flux of bloody discharge.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them, so that we may dissolve the cold wound infection from the member: just as we set a wound on the navel and umbilicus.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes the pain on that account, because it resolves that wound infection.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	And also it is applied on the kidneys, when there occurs in them a blockage or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For the virtue of its attraction perhaps opens up the blockage, or eradicates the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And it does similarly when applied on the chest and spleen to remove wound infection from both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these wounds are treated with an ointment alone, without incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are treated with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are treated with full warm water in abundant fluxes: and that is, so that the wound may be filled, and it be large, with hot water alone, or with water in which herbs that are suitable have been decocted.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of wounds treated with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	The width of its opening should be two fingers open, according to what we have formed: and the amount of it in depth should be half a palm: and there should be on its side, in the place which is around its middle, a small hole, according to the quantity that enters into the acus: let it be made from copper or tin, with a thick margin, smooth, equal, polished: so that it does not hurt the member at its position upon it: and there should be in its middle a transverse rod of copper or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this large wound is made, greater than we described, and a little smaller than the other, according to the weakness and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For there are different (wounds) for boys and thin people, which are not the same as those for men and stout bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this wound with fire on the member is such that you should apply a linen cloth with fire to it decently, or a small candle made from wax; and place it over the middle of the transverse vein which is in the middle of the wound: so that the ignited fire may be around the lower part of the wound, so as not to burn the weak body.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it should be placed on the member; and the finger should be on the opening which I mentioned, until when we hold the wound: while we are in need, we remove the finger, and the vapor exits through that opening, and the wound is immediately resolved.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then apply a linen cloth to the fire according to its own method, and repeat this if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But in the wound which is treated with water on a weak lung, there is no transverse vein, nor an opening; and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and placed only on the member.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this wound, the larger it is, so that it may hold a lot of water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Of the suspension of blood-suckers.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood-suckers are not administered in many cases, unless in those members where it is not possible to position wounds, due to their smallness, such as the lip, and gums, and similar ones.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a member denuded of flesh, such as the finger, and nose, and similar ones.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that you should choose those Blood-suckers which are in sweet waters, clean and free from putridity.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are left overnight in fresh water, until they become soft, and nothing remains in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is evacuated at first with bloodletting, and with vomiting.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then the membrane of the affected part is cleaned, until it becomes red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Thereafter, they are applied above it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When therefore they are filled, and fall, and it is possible to suck the location with vomiting, then it is almost the last resort in healing: and if not, then wash the location with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and they are rubbed, and pressed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	What if the flow of blood is prolonged after the injury of the blood vessels, and it is that which is to be washed out: then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and put it above, until the washing out is completed.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if the blood increases, then powder above it with powdered zeolite or gallic, and similar things from astringent powders: until the blood is stemmed.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or medio-persing beans are applied above the location, and they are left, until the beans adhere to the location, for the blood is stemmed.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary, if repeated bleeding is needed, when possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if the blood vessels are prohibited from suspending, then the location is cleaned with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or a fig is applied to the locations, until something goes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are applied, for they themselves, when they feel something from the blood, adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore they are about to fall, powder above them something from triturated aloe, or salt, or ashes: and they fall immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A general discourse on restoration and dislocation, and treatment of twists, and similar things.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O sons, that many stupid doctors and the common people boast of this chapter, who have never examined an ancient book, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this cause, it happens that this method is deprived of sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I did not obtain anything good from it at all, and I did not acquire what I acquired except through the length of reading ancient books, and study above their intellect, until I extracted the knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experience and long study throughout my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from that, in this Chapter, all that contains my science: and about what has passed through my experience, since I abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of lengthiness, and abbreviated it with a fine abbreviation, and showed it with a fine declension: and I formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, as it is by addition of declension, just as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	In summary, and collections from being fractures of bones, from those whose preliminary treatment is necessary, before we begin the remembrance of broken members, and diverse ones, if singularly.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is fitting, as we say in the prologue of this Chapter, to summarize the discourse and chapters, towards which understanding the artist is first moved to station himself over their truth: namely that you, and those who are prompt, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or fall occurs, then it is necessary to phlebotomize him first and to loosen him, or both at the same time: if nothing prohibits it, such as debility of virtue; or if he is one who has experienced something from those things in childhood, or an elderly decrepit person; or if it is a time of vehement heat or vehement cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his usual food, cold dishes, and birds' meat, and game; and prohibit wine, and gross meats, and refrain from foods that fill the veins full of blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when he is secure from the aposteme of heat, and does not at that time have an effusion of matter to a limb; then the sick person returns to his first regime with which his custom had been accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When therefore the fractured bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the sick person be fed with nourishing foods of much nutriment, thick, heavy, in which there is viscosity; such as dishes made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and entrails of goats, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen the consolidation of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that fractured bones, when they are in people who are in early old age and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be consolidated and consoled according to their natural order forever, on account of the dryness of their members; and they are consolidated and continued which are from them in the end of lenity, such as the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	But truly nature adds to the fractured bone from all sides something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds, until they cohere and are tied together, until they come to a state of strength and firmness, as they were at first, so that nothing prohibits them from their operations: and for this reason it is necessary, that you put nourishing food before the sick person, in which there are heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of members; for a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the skull bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly all remaining members have distinct differences in their fracture species; and I will come with remembrance of each species of fracture exhibited distinctly in its own chapter.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of bone fractures are also differentiated even within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because there is an arched fracture, besides what happens to it in its ridges.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when there is a fracture of it according to the length of the bone; and its fractures are jagged, that is, ridges, and additions proceeding, just as they are in a reed, when it is fitted with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding; and it is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head; and it is a small fissure fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every species has its own ingenuity, or proper instrument in its restoration, according to what comes to mind about it, distinctly in its own places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that by which the fracture of the bone is known, is its tortuousness, and its own eminences; and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no tortuousness appearing in the place, nor sound upon touch with your agitation, nor does the weak one feel great pain: then there is no fracture there, or it is possible that there is a tortuousness, or small fissure; and so it is not necessary to move it with your hand and compression altogether, but rather put medicine on it, whose remembrance comes at the moment, after the opportune time arrives in that place: then let the subtle strictura be tightened.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that the place when it is arched and divided into two, besides what happens to it in its ridges, indeed all parts are removed from their comparison: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to rectify it, making it equal before a hot aposteme occurs.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If a warm abscess occurs in it, then leave it for some days, until the apostema quiets down.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then treat it equally according to whatever method he can from gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and its equalization are easier than of bones, in which splints are applied.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to what will seem to you a reminder of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If indeed there are splints on the bone, then extension of this fractured member is necessary from two parts, if it is a hand or foot: or with your hand, if it is a small member: or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be where you place the member above an equal place, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the fractured member are extended: then strive, that you may restore those additions with all skill, and according to whatever method you can in their places: and beware according to your strength, lest pain or injury occur on the weakened part through your operation: and strive according to your strength, that you may apply one of the two bones with its companion, according to the better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that time, that you should touch and feel it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it, and equalize it according to the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of vehement extension and strong compression, as many of the foolish do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For they often cause a warm abscess to occur through their operation, or a contraction in the member: as we have already seen that from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then connect after equalization, and a decent operation, and the stricture of that member, and quiet, and tranquility: and warn the weakened part about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make it cautious, lest it moves in its hour of watchfulness, and its own sleep at its revolution, and its agitation, and at its evacuation, and all its movements with its ultimate strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And take care, lest the position of the member be a position that follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	What is, because when it feels pain in the positioning of the member or injury: then it is necessary, that you change it to another positioning where it does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And take care with that, so its position is equal and straight: so that no crookedness occurs in the member when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the structure of the broken member is, according to what I relate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You should know that fractured members are differentiated in their smallness, and their magnitude, and their own form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Those therefore which are small among them, such as the arm, and finger, and neck, and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those however which are large among them, such as the hip, and leg, it is necessary that there be a wrapping of broad, hard cloth.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the wide bandage connects the large member and binds it from every side with equal tension, so that it does not gird it with a constriction.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin to put a suitable plaster next to the equality of your evacuation, on a soft cushion above the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage above the place of the fracture itself with three or four wrappings, according to what the member deserves: and bind your hand briefly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with it to the upper part above the place of the fracture, and bind less than was your previous tension, by which you bound the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with the wrapping above the place of the fracture briefly, and gradually loosen the tension, until you grasp from the healthy place a great thing.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another wrapping, and wrap it again above the fractured place with wrappings.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then look with attention to the inferior part at the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightening of the involution, and its softening, according to what we said in the first upper involution.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the involutions a clean linen cloth or a piece of cloth with which the twistedness of the fracture is equalized, if there is twistedness in it; and if not, do not put anything on it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then envelop above that same wound another.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then place equalizing splints on these involutions, made to fit exactly, if there is no swelling in the location, nor hot aposteme.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is swelling or an aposteme in it: then place on it what will settle that aposteme and reduce the swelling; and leave it for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind above it those splints.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the splints be made from mid-ribs of broad cane, smoothed, skillfully shaped: or let them be made from wood where cribra are made, which are made from pine, or cedar, that is, palm branches, or walnut: and let the width of all the splints be according to this form and this same shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the splint which is placed above the wound be somewhat thicker and broader than the other splints: and the length of the splint should be according to what is permitted by the member in terms of size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind above the splints with another cloth, according to the first strictura, the same.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie above with threads exactly, according to what we said about the strictura: and it is, that your strictura should be more over the place of the fracture: and as much as the fracture is longer, the strictura is smaller.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary, that the threads be moderate in thickness and fineness, and let them be made from soft flax.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Since the threads are thick, as is seen from the operation of stupid surgeons who place their own threads twisted like a linen rope, it is a great mistake: because the structure collapses with them beyond its quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And fine threads do not fit again: because you do not achieve through the structure with them that which you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not suitable, so that it is between the star-shaped (formation) and the star-shaped (formation) less than a finger.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	What if the weak place is injured through the extremities of the star-shaped (formations) after the structure in healthy places: then put under them a piece of clean linen or Carmanian wool, until nothing is injured by that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When, however, there is a fracture with an ulcer, and disruption occurs in the skin, I describe it with remembrance of its singularity in the second chapter.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured member needs to be bound with star-shaped (formations) from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	What is, that because the member is large, it does not need to be bound with star-shaped (formations) unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the occurrence of a hot aposteme.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasterings, which the ancients used to restore, which are placed upon fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The method of common plastering, abbreviated, restoring fractures, suitable for many complexions, especially for women and children: because it is based on that which neither heat nor cold overcomes.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, that you take from the dust of the mill, and it is the marrow of the flour which clings to the walls of the mill at the movement of the millstone: and you mix it as it is, except that you sieve it with a fine sieve: and you put its confection not thick, nor subtle.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of applying a plaster for restoring a fracture, and a dislocation, and a twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take mess, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugath; and juice of all, a tenth X of myrrh, and aloe of both, a fifth V, and alethil, twenty times, they grind everything, and sieve, and mix with water, or with white wax, if the injured part is inflamed.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then apply this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, and quickly restores a fractured bone, and helps many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of applying a plaster, which also helps fractures and twistings.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugath, and mess, and white plantain, of all a tenth X of myrrh, and aloe of both a fifth V, acacia a sixth VI, Armenian bole twenty times, they grind everything in many contritions, and sieve, and mix with water, or with white wax; and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Another method of applying a plaster for joints and separated bones in their places; and it soothes the accidental pain, and division of bone, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take a layer of suet, and soak it in vinegar, and oil decoction; and place it on the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good for soothing hot apostemes; and it drives out pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Another method of applying a plaster that restores a fractured bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of figs of the forest, and leaves of silvan papyrus; and grind everything, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	A method of applying a shortened plaster for administering at the restoration of a fractured bone; and when you want to resolve the remaining inflammation.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take roots of plantain, and chamomile, and flowers of violet, and herb powder, all in one part; they grind everything, and mix with wine, if there is no inflamed member.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is inflamed, then apply it with water of coriander in a humid state, or with water, and use it thus.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another mode of plastering for a stronger resolution, which is the first one, when there occurs a hard aposteme during the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe of roots of altea, and seeds of flax, and balaustiae, and melliloti, and samsuci, and violet flowers, and chamomile, all equal parts, they are ground into a powder, and mixed with water of willow, or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All that is applied according to the warmth of the limb, and the tranquility of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that anything should be applied to a fractured limb for its restoration, unless it is made with cerates and oil; nothing else; and he narrated that it should be a medium between thickness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But to Galen it seemed best that those things should be applied to a fractured limb for its restoration, in which there is an extraction of warmth, such as myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense, and similar things from those which we have narrated.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	A mode of plastering that is suitable for a wound and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe of mugwort, and cicers, and hair of human incisors, or bird's feather, and altea, equal parts; they are ground into a powder, and sieved, and mixed together; and let an plaster be made from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity however is according to what is fitting, so that the bandage remains, then it is dissolved, it is, as you should consider then, if there does not occur weakness of pain, nor itching, nor the fractured bone is moved from its place; then it is not resolved for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	But if there occurs to it in its place a severe itching, or disturbing pain, or inflammation: then remove quickly, and dissolve it at that hour, and take away the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a gentle marine sponge, humid; and submerge it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it, until the itching is quieted, and the pain is assuaged.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the member rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put on it a compress of succidum, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it on at night for one day, until the member is free from inflammation, and the pain is relieved.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then apply a subtle stricture to it, and a small plaster: and do not bind it with your first constraint, but subtly, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, and redness, and pain, and inflammation, and all the accidents are now completely removed, and you have applied plaster and stricture, then apply it just as you did at first, equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If something from what we have said does not happen to the member, then do not release it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is left for twenty days altogether, according to what appears to you from the solution of the member, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh approaches upon it: add also then in the stricture more than your first entire stricture: and add also in the thickening of food for the infirm, according to what the previous remembrance of it was.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see that the place of the fracture is already drying out and thinning more than it should: then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Bathe it therefore with lukewarm water at every opportunity where you release it, and let it be so for three days, and loosen the stricture a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation, nourishment is brought to the member, and it is healed quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	That which foolish restorers do from a fracture of the member at another time, when it is not restored at first, according to what is proper, and is restored according to their twistedness, is an error in their operation, and great fear: and if it were right, the ancients would have written that in their books, and would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen any of their signs in that entire thing, and it is more correct, so that it does not become that.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Concerning the fracture of an accidental wound on the head.
Caput III.	Head 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of fractures are diverse, and its figures are many: and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture that occurs from a blow with a tool, and the blow carries through the whole bone until it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an axis does in wood; and on account of this, this species of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the tool strikes something of the bone, and strikes its surface, and does not penetrate to the very end of it: and this species of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Absolute Elevation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture that is a compression, or an abrasion: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which already approaches the membrane, which is under the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone: and it is a wound of these two fractures, also either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone in the subtlety of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and on account of this, this species of fracture is called Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And there is a fracture that occurs from a fall or a blow with a stone, and similar things, which cause the lamina of the bone to ingress inward, and it becomes concave: just as it happens to copper vessels when they are struck and a part of them ingresses inward.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And it very often occurs in the moist bones of the head, such as are the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And there are fractures of all these kinds, separated and distinct, and I describe them with a reminder of the entire thing in its proper place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these kinds of fracture through examination on it, and inquiry into them with stretched-out parts, and removal of corrupted flesh which is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The hairy species is recognized by this, that it is detected on the bone, and is scraped off, and is anointed over it with a warm poultice: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the accidents of the injured person: then if you see from the accidents what they signify by manifest signs on the fear, such as vomiting of bile, and extension, and loss of intellect, and interruption of speech, and fainting, and acute fever, and protrusion of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar things from the accidents in many dispositions, it is doubtful that it will not be cured: and if you see non-threatening accidents, and hope for health: then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	What is, if the wounded person comes to you at first with a wound: and it is during the winter days, then it is necessary that you should focus on removing the bone splinters before the fourteenth day according to every disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is during the summer days, then it is necessary that you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, lest it becomes corrupted by the pus under the bone, and those accidents occur which we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	What if the fracture of the bone has now reached the membrane touching the brain, and it is with smallness, and attraction: then it is necessary that you should cut into the comminuted part, and the attracted part, according to what I relate to you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, that you should shave the head of the wounded person: and detect the bone according to whatever method is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is lightly upon the injured part.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it happens to you during the dissection of a bone flux with bloody discharge, or a warm aposteme: then apply to it what is appropriate.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, that you fill the place with cloths infused in wine and rose oil: and make the wound rest, until the aposteme is settled, and you are secure from the bloody discharge.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin with the cure of the bone, and its ablution.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two modes.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One mode indeed is, that you cut the bone with a strict incision of the acie: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another instrument after the incision, wider than it previously: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then administer also another instrument, even wider also than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second mode is, that you have a number of diverse incision instruments: some of which are wider than others, and some of which are shorter than others: and they should be at the end of their sharpened extremities, and they should be made of iron, or forged: and use facility in percussion on the incision instrument, so that it does not strike the head, and hurts itself.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary, that you perforate around it, before you administer incision instruments, with drills which are called non-penetrating Drills: and they are not called thus, unless because they themselves do not transcend the boundary of the fleshy bone to that which is behind it: for this reason, because the Drill is a round extremity above that which is under its sharp head, similar to an edge, and a small circle prevents submersion, and transgresses the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take from these drills a large number, each of which is suited to the quantity of the bone's thickness, until there is present to you an entire set of drills: whose sharp extremity's quantity in length and breadth is, according to the quantity of the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three species of skull saws, or trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of piercing around the broken bone is such that you place the trephine on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the trephine to another location, and put what is in every hole the quantity of the thickness of the radius, or around that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with incisors what is in every hole from the bone: and make it as subtle as you can on that from the fineness of the levity, as we said, until you eradicate the bone, or with your hand, or with some other instrument, which you prepared for that: such as forceps, and subtle pincers.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to beware with all caution, lest you touch the trephine or incisors with anything of the syphon.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you are circumcising the bone by piercing, and it has been separated from the syphon, if it was continuous with it, and you extract it, it is necessary to scrape, and equally smooth out what remains of it in the bone with another instrument similar to an incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thin and more subtle than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	What remains of small bone fragments and sawdust: then take them with ease, along with what is at hand among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound after that with bandages and ointments which we mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, far removed from fear: which Galen said and praised with great praise: and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin to uncover the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most vehement and manifest: until when you have uncovered that part, and placed underneath it the extremity of this lenticular incisor, whose form this is.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the concave part does not cut anything, and its acute part on both sides of it descends in length, as you see; so that the concave part is inclined to the siphach, with its acute part falling onto the bone of the face.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike above the Incisor with one side of a small hammer, until you cut through the whole bone with ease, as it is revolved: and you should be careful with the panniculus, lest something happens to it, which you fear may occur.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon were not more stupid than men, and more ignorant of it, nor asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the panniculus in certain places, he would cut it away from there with the extremity of the lenticular incisor, and release it from there with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is released from there without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the panniculum, and that which is cut away from the bone is its surface, and roughnesses and subtle projections remain in it: then it is necessary, so that you scrape off that roughness, and eradicate those projections with subtle rasps which you have prepared in a diverse quantity of numbers, so that it may be possible for you to administer them in every convenient place, and more direct ones, according to that to which the operation leads you, and the fractured bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary, that you administer in your rasping, where first you scrape the bone, more broadly with those rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use afterwards a more subtle one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to continuity, until you arrive at administering the most subtle and fine of all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining small cracks and subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer care, according to that which leads to its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing that is not hidden from everyone, to whom there is any study in this art, and he stands upon what we have written, and shows in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, a piece of cloth is detected and retained, when you extract the bone: then it is necessary to take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and put it on the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and put it on top of the first cloth: and do that which you can most easily do to it, so that it does not become swollen.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply a wide bandage on top of it: and do not tighten it, unless by the amount that holds the wound together just so; and leave it with this care for one day, or two days, until you are secure from a cold aposteme.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it, and apply afterwards medicines with which there is excessive dryness: such as the roots of lily, and herb flour, and powder of frankincense, and aristolochia, and similar things: and it is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which is powdered over the wound as they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply to it all medicine from its property that is to cleanse and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And beware according to your skill, that the wound in your treatment is clear: neither should there be foulness of ointment in it, nor foulness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor should you allow pus to collect in it at all: because when pus collects on the surface of the brain, it corrupts it, and putrefies it, and a great evil happens to the weak person after that; and now it happens in the siphac of the head, when the bone is cleaned from it, especially when the care of it is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider therefore, at that time, if an infirmity occurs which we have described, know that it is a perilous and dubious outcome.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackening does not occur, unless from the medicine that is applied to it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine, so as to bring about that blackening: then it is necessary to take one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and to apply a linen cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put it on the wound; afterwards treat it with the remedies of healing that are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is not fractured except for its two upper parts together, or one of them: because they are two bones; since its lower part is cartilaginous, it is not fractured, and does not happen to it unless there is attrition, and tortuousness, and similitude.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts is fractured, then it is necessary to introduce a small finger into the nostril and adjust that fracture with your index finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and let this be done skillfully, with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And take care, lest it happens through your operation that the wounded part suffers pain.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach to the finger: then it is necessary to adjust the extremity of the radius, where there is a small swelling.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If indeed the fracture is in two parts, then do similarly to that: and take care with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at the time of quiet and warm application.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then introduce into the extremity of the nose a swathe of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part: or introduce two swathes if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be in the swathe a swelling of such quantity as to fill the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that they should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	But it does not seem to me, rather it is fitting, that the ligature be soaked in a decoction of egg white, mixed with powder of millet.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then release the ligature until the bone is strengthened, and the cartilage is induced.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And when a feather of a goose is inserted into the nostril in place of the ligature, after it has been wrapped with a soft cloth: and it happens that it holds the fracture of the nose more strongly, and so that it does not prevent the patient from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not a necessary thing.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that; and if you wish, do the ligatures.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	What if the nose becomes irritated again while you are operating with a warm apostemum, apply to the nose a plaster made with cedar, or with wax infused in rose oil, or a moderate amount of dyaulion.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If the warm apostemum does not irritate, then it is fitting to apply a plaster made with flour of fenugreek, and powder of frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put a soft padding over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are broken into small fragments, or are crushed, then it is fitting to separate them from each other, and to extract them with instruments that are suitable for this.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew it up, and care for it with what promotes flesh growth, and consolidate it with suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	What if a wound occurs between the nose, then it is fitting to care for it with ligatures: and apply a tube of lead, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is dislocated.
Caput V.	Head 5.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jawbone is dislocated and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then consider if its fracture is only external, and it does not break into two pieces, but curves inwardly; then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	It is necessary, therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, to insert the index finger of your left hand into the mouth of the injured person; similarly, if the fracture is on the left jawbone, then insert the index finger of your right hand: and push with it the curvature of the fracture from inside outwards with ease, using your other hand on the inner side of the bone to guide it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	When the fracture of the jawbone has already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer extension from both parts, according to straightness, until its alignment becomes possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If there has been a concussion or disruption of the teeth, then bind them with a thread of gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a compress over the fractured jawbone.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over it a doubled cloth, and place over the cloth a large star-shaped fixture made to fit; or an equal piece of leather from the sole of a shoe, along the length of the jawbone.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it above, according to the preparation of the ligature that is made for you, and its application is suitable, so that it does not come apart; and advise the injured person to be calm and quiet; and give their food in soft, easy-to-swallow bits.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If you think that something has already changed in the shape of the jawbone in some way, then wait and release it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been altered from it, and apply a plaster made of flour mill dust, with egg white, or with wheat flour, after you have removed the compress; and place a soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	Therefore, when that plaster remains applied over it and the bone's disposition is not altered, leave it, lest you disturb the healing; or it may exacerbate the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often exacerbated during the seven days of treatment.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	What if during that time a hot abscess should occur, then administer what we have mentioned many times in its treatment, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with an open wound, be careful.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For now the bone fragment is separated from the ossicle, or from a splinter; then be subtle in this, so that you may remove those splinters with what is convenient to you in their removal by instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If the orifice of the wound is constricted, then dilate it with a fleam according to the quantity of your necessity.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed the splinters, and none of them remain, thus then the orifice of the wound, if it is wide: and if not, place over it from plasters that are suitable for that, and they will heal it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the Crural bone, when it is fractured.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The Crural bone is indeed frequently fractured from the front part of the humerus, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it is fractured and separated into two, apart from what happens with those splinters: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or it happens as with the bone splinters: and it is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or it is a fracture with an open wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in this case when the fracture is without an open wound is, to have two assistants present, one of whom holds the instrument that follows the fractured Crural bone, and the other extends the neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make an equal fracture of your fingers, so that its shape is formed according to what is needed, and it does not have prominence in it, nor concavities.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	What if you need more extension, then it is necessary to place a small sphere under the cloth or wool: and its size should be according to your necessity: and extend and elevate the forearm, and bind the sphere with your hand, so that it makes an equal fracture, according to what is needed.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	What if you cannot draw out the forearm to the exterior: because it penetrates to the deep: then it is necessary to rest the weak one on his neck: and place a medium-sized cushion under his shoulder, and press the ministering shoulder downwards, so that the bone of the forearm which is in the depths rises upwards: and then rectify the fracture, and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a crepitus coming from the forearm and it moves: then it is necessary to fix above that, and extract it as a dislocated thing with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then cleverly make an incision with one of the incisors you prepared for that, after you have placed under the forearm an instrument that holds a splint: and the instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is similar to a spoon which has no concavities.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to what you need for it from the size of the bone and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length, indeed, is also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two extremities, as you see: and one extremity should be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the disruption of the wound which you made when you extracted the dislocated bone is wide, and it is secure from the hot aposteme: then join the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or a warm poultice is applied: then fill the wound with lint and soft cloths according to the quantity of the wound's separation.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	What if a warm poultice is applied, then soak a cloth in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and put it on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	A stiffness of the bone occurs when there is no wound and no fracture, it is, that you should put on the bone a plaster made from flour of millet with albumen of egg.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put a soft padding over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then put a bandage under the armpit, if it is needed there.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a bandage, that is, a strap which the Saracens hold, which should be long indeed: and its width should be one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then put a double layer of soft cloth over the padding and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a splint from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the splint in the place of the bandage that falls on the fracture and location.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then put the bandage on the fracture as it is wrapped, and wrap it around the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the diseased armpit: and reduce it over every part, and in such a way that you see that the bandage holds the fracture in place decently: and it is thus, that it is not hidden from you, and all, so that the splint does not move away from the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And because of this, it is necessary to examine the diseased part every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	As often as the bandage becomes loosened, and you see the splint is already being removed: then straighten it out, and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put the patient to sleep on their back, and place a small pillow under their side near their hip at night, so that it may be raised as an aid to their lateral region.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	It is elevated therefore the fracture of the elbow through the elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the binding, unless it becomes irritated at the site of the irritation, or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the dressing, if you see his face is turning to that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add a tightening, and leave it, until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed the fracture of the elbow is tightened and comforted according to the greatest extent in twenty-eight days; and sometimes it happens in certain men in a shorter time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the restoration of a fracture of the shoulder blade.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The shoulder blade is rarely fractured, and it is broken in its broad part: and they are not broken except at their edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore it is fractured at that place, and it is broken in the middle of it, and it is not recognized except by touch; then according to the shape of the fracture prepare its treatment.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to its natural shape in every way of ingenuity, as much as is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put on the spot a powder of millet with egg white, and a gentle plaster, and put above it a small pillow made from folded cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on it a broad star-shaped [bandage] from a subtle tablecloth according to the quantity of the whole shoulder blade, or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed under the star-shaped [bandage] there is a concavity at some place of the shoulder blade, then equalize that concavity with a gentle plaster, until the star-shaped [bandage] descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then the suture is placed above with a long thread, making a decent tightening, and firmness of the stars, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligature in every way.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	As often as the ligature is loosened, tighten it, and make the star equal if it moves from its place; and let it be weakened over its healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And indeed the splint is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is complete, then loosen the ligature; and you will be in security.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose joining is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If a fragment proceeds from the bone and pierces under the skin: then split above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said about the fracture of the ankle joint from the treatment of a hot aposteme, if something happens to it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured rib.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone when it is broken in its middle, and that rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities are indeed frequently broken, and are dislocated from accidents to it.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle is broken, which declines to the lower parts, and a severe pain happens to it, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps it vomits blood, and the fracture in the bone is declared, and does not hide from the senses. Its restoration is, that the weakened part should be raised above its back: and place among splints of its mattress.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press its shoulders, and bring together the ribs from both sides or flanks with hands: and adjust it in its equilibrium, according to every method by which it is possible and convenient, until the shape of the bone returns, according to what is necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put on top of it a plaster and a compress, and place above it a thin plate made from willow or tamarisk, or similar things in a gentle manner, after you have wrapped it in a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then bind it gently over the fractured bone, so that it is not dislocated: and take care with the binding according to the roundness of the back several times, and constrict it with a suitable strapping.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the binding at every hour, and as often as it becomes soft, constrict it: and if the necessity of it provokes a solution for its itching, or the corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or abscess: then be ready, and release it, and remove the plaster, and correct what has happened with the method of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you see that it is returning to its former condition: and apply a bandage to it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the restoration of ribs, when they are fractured.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur, unless in thick places which follow the back, and from the extremities of these from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen to them with bruising, unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of the same is not hidden from the sense during examination with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in this way, that you equalize the fracture with your fingers according to the possible method, until it becomes equal in shape, according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply a plaster, and constrict the fractured bone with a thin plate, if it needs that.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined towards the interior: then it happens that a severe and vehement pain occurs, and punctures, like the puncture that happens to one who has pleurisy: because, since the bone pierces inwardly, and also difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood occurs: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And now the ancients were ingenious in this with many ingenuities: and among them are those who say that you should place foods that generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the stomach may become inflamed and extended, and the fracture is driven outward.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We indeed reject this, lest it not make a bad cause for creating a hot abscess, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already happened, then he adds to it there.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let a poultice be applied to the windy place, then it should be pressed with force, and this is more like a rational treatment.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the poultice attracts windy superfluities to the location, on account of a debilitating disposition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is fitting that the location be covered with wool that has already been steeped in hot oil: and poultices are applied between the ribs, until it is full: so that there may be an equal ligature when it is wrapped around according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the patient should be treated with a treatment of pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	Since the severe disease oppresses the patient, which he does not tolerate, and the sharp pain of the pointed puncture wounds, and we fear for the patient: then it is necessary to dissect above the location, and to separate from the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we should place on it an instrument that preserves the suture, whose memory has preceded: and we should make an incision with ease, and we should cut into it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we should bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture: and we should treat it with plasters, until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	Since if a hot abscess happens in the meantime, then it is fitting, and inject poultices soaked in rose oil, and apply them to the location: and the patient should be treated with what is suitable for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	In the meantime, let him be positioned on his side where he slept, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of fractures of the vertebral column of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Head 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	When a fracture occurs in the neck bones, and it rarely happens to them with attrition, and similarly to the vertebral column of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When that happens to someone, and you want to know whether he will be healed or not, then consider it.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and numb, and dead: and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor constrict them: and when you constrict them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and he does not feel pain in them: then know that he will not be healed, and in many cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them, and feels the constriction with your fingers and the prick: then know that the vertebra is sound, and that the patient will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if it happens to the vertebral column of the back similarly, and you want to know whether he will be healed or not: then consider his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and the same thing happens to them as happened to the hands: next when he lies on his back, wind and excretion come out without his will: and when he is positioned on his belly, excretion comes out without his will: and when he is positioned on his back, and he wants to urinate, but cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Do not therefore labor in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If nothing happens to him from that, the case is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for what happened to him from that is, that you should try a gentle sedative application: thus, that you place rose oil alone on the affected vertebral column: or with egg yolks boiled in water.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place it on the affected area several times a day, until when the aposteme is warm: then place one of the comforting, drying, and constricting plasters over the area, and bind it with a ligature: and especially for the weakened person, so that they may use quiet and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Let them not sleep on the affected part with which they find pain, until they are healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens to be a bone worn away by friction, or something that is already separated from it: then it is necessary to sew up the skin, and remove that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some incarnative ointment, until it heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the end of the bone is fractured and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and with the other hand grasp the broken bone, according to what is possible, and in a secondary adjustment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place it on top, and remove it: and treat the wound with the treatment that preceded, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	On the restoration of the ankle.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the ankle are rarely fractured.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	When they are fractured, then the fracture of them is not without a comminution at their extremities: and they split along their length, and decline towards the interior: and there occurs weakness, pain in the place, and numbness: and the leg that is fractured becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration indeed is, to extend your hand over it, until you stand on the fracture in whatever shape it is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at its extremities, then equalize that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from the adjustment, until it is assimilated to its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If the fracture is longitudinal or already declined inward, then make the injured person lie on their belly until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have aligned it, put a plaster on it; then place a wooden or leather splint on it, and tighten the bandage over it so that you do not fear a change in the fracture or a removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And adjust the concavity of those with what fills it, until it takes hold of it according to its equality; and order the injured person to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If a hot abscess occurs to him: then cease from extending it and its restoration, until the hot abscess settles; and put on it what settles it, according to what has preceded, then return to its restoration; and bind it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If a fragment occurs in the bone, or becomes detached, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Concerning the restoration of fractures of the helpers.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The helper is that which is between the elbow and the head of the Spatula (a type of surgical instrument).
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it is therefore fractured, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: to take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligatures are tied at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from an elevated place: and the injured person sits on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he places his fractured arm over the wood, until it reaches the tender part of it, in the middle of which there is a curved attachment of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang something heavy above it, so that it stretches it out downwards to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician adjusts the fracture with his hands, until the fracture is rearranged, according to what is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is to place the injured person on their back, and hang their hand from their neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two assistants, one to hold what is above the fracture with their hands, and the other to hold below it, each extending to their respective side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish to make the extension stronger, then tie below the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage; and each of the two assistants should extend to their respective sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is near the articulation of the humerus, then it is necessary to put one bandage below the nipple and another beneath the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary to put a bandage above that place and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equalize the fracture with ease and without effort, until when the fracture is aligned according to what is necessary, and a good application is made: then tie it, if not an hot abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If a hot abscess occurs, then loosen the bandage until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And put on it a piece of clean cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the abscess quiets down: then tie it: and the method of tying is to apply a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then add the arm to the support, and place his hand open on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put on a cloth, and tie around the support arm, so that the arm stands in its place like a star: if nothing prevents you from it, nor is anything altered concerning you because of the fractured bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	But if something is altered concerning you because of the fractured bone, then use a star-shaped bandage: and it is, that you put on the fracture itself a star-shaped bandage which is wider and stronger than other bandages.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And you should place between every width of the finger's breadth: and let the length of the stellae be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers' breadth on every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tie above the stellae a constriction as I described at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that your constriction above the place of the fracture should be stricter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And as much as the fracture is more elongated, let the constriction be less.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If you see the position of the stellae and the constriction, as we have said, at the hour when you restore the member at once, then do it: and if you apply a warm apostema, then release the constriction and stellae until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for three days altogether, so that there may not occur itching at the site, or inflammation, or be prohibited by food from reaching the member, on account of the excessive tightness of the constriction.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Correct it therefore entirely, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If you are confident that nothing will happen from it: then do not loosen the ligature until after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient sleep on his back, and his hand on his stomach: and place under the supporting cushion a full layer of wool, evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night or day, that the shape of the fractured member is not loosened, or the ligature softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Correct it therefore entirely by your virtue.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give the patient food according to the order which we have mentioned, so that the food is subtle at first, until the wound begins to consolidate: then it is necessary to increase his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is the custom of the helper and the knee to be constricted for forty days: then therefore it is necessary to loosen, and to administer a bath, and to be treated with ointments that correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture was dirty and crushed, then do not release the bandage from it for 50 days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of a fracture of the arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two hollows.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is small and it is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is the one that is placed below the small one on the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore only the larger hollow bone is fractured, or the smaller one; and perhaps they are both fractured at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller hollow bone is fractured above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower hollow bone is fractured, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones are fractured at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is fractured is the smaller hollow one above, then it is fitting for the physician, in its restoration, to apply a small extension with ease, until it is equal to itself.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If indeed the larger hollow bone is the one that is fractured: then it is necessary to apply a stronger binding force.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to apply the shape of the hand at its restoration, and also an extended extension above the pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers above: and let it be lower at the joint of all the fingers, or the remaining ones: and let the weak person sit squarely on himself, and let the pillow be in front of him, or directly above him, at a height, so that the weak person does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the assistant extends the arm from the lower part, or with their hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant extends it from above similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician should reduce the bone, so that he restores it to a better shape as much as possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	What if there are splinters in the fracture of the bone, then try to reduce every fragment into its own place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed there appears a separated splinter in it, and it pierces the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then put something over it, and remove it according to the method that we mentioned in the previous cases.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If, however, the fracture is with a wound, I have already dealt with that in a separate chapter, so receive the treatment of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	What if at the beginning of your restoration a hot aposteme occurs, then apply a linen cloth with a cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be a medium between thickness and subtlety: and tie the cloth over it with a subtle strapping, until the aposteme settles down: then remove the cerate, and put on a plaster prepared from flour of millet with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on splints, and let the splint that is put on the fracture itself be a little broader and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints on the arm is six in most arrangements: whether the fracture is in one forearm or in two forearms at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put your strapping over the place of the fracture stronger and more vehement, and a little more with the strapping above the fracture or below it: or put a softer strapping, slightly, according to what was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture be soft, humid cloths: and not rough, harsh ones.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is bound be made from linen, medium between subtle and thick, as we narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and ligament after a few days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something happens that requires rectification, such as itching that occurs in a limb, then it is necessary to bathe the affected limb with warm water until the itching subsides and release the limb without constriction, until it subsides; then tighten it again.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the constriction is already softened and the bone is already removed, and similar things: then rectify the whole thing with your strength, and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb because of the excess constriction, then it is necessary to soften it a little, and release it for some days, until it runs to that nourishment, then constrict it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if none of the things we mentioned happen to the patient, then it is not necessary to loosen it, unless after twenty days or around that time.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the patient should be suspended at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be equal, and it should be protected with its strength from agitated movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it will be restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of that is according to the dispositions of the complexions, and the dispositions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Of the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fracture rarely occurs in the pelvis of the hand and the nodes of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not occur to it, unless there is much repeated rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture of the sole occurs, or rubbing: then it is necessary that the patient should sit squarely: and let his seat be before him according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then put his hand on it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the attending physician extends the broken bone, and adjusts it until they join with a good joint.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is fitting to apply a poultice and a compress, if there does not occur a warm aposteme.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then put a star-shaped dressing on top according to the size of the place, and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If the fracture is around the lower part of the sole of the foot, then make a spherical shape out of cloth; and bind it to the injured person, so that it holds with the foot in its fractured state; then tie it up with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the dressing be of leather, in which there is gentleness, so that the leather may be applied to the body of the foot; and tie it up, according to what is fitting.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is on the outer side, then it is fitting to put a dressing on top and another dressing below on the sole of the foot; and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put a bandage, as the hand revolves; and extend it between the toes with a binding.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If there occurs a fracture of some nodes of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be straightened according to what is fitting.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie it up with the sole of the foot; and if you wish, put a straight, small dressing on it, so that the fracture may be elevated, and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is of the remaining fingers, such as the middle finger, and the index finger, or the ring finger, then it should be straightened, and tied with a healthy finger that follows it; or they should all be tied together according to their continuity; and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put a small dressing on top of it, as we said about the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the disposition of a warm aposteme; and oppose with it what is fitting, when something happens from that, according to how its story is repeated.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip joint is frequently dislocated and is made manifest to the senses, because it turns inward and outward to the front and back parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done thus, that a ligament is tightened above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the weakened part is stretched out over its own surface.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then every ligament is extended to its own part according to equality: and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then the ligament should be towards the part of the pubis, so that the extension falls upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then the ligament should be near the knee, so that the extension is towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician equalizes the bone with both his hands, until he reduces it according to the similarity of the natural figure: and he joins the bone with a good conjunction.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply an emplaster and a bandage, if there does not occur an abscess in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if an abscess occurs in it: then leave it for some days, until the warm abscess settles, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandage should be thus tight.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to put a soft involution over the fracture, that is, a binding: and double or triple it: and let the excess remain above.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then bind the leg, until the heel bone reaches the root of the hip.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee towards the lower parts, and let the extremities of the threads be tied at the upper part of the two joints.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over the leg and hip what is left over from the involution.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put on the hip at the place of the fracture a stellar bandage, and put one of them as a stellar bandage over the knee joint.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill in the empty spaces between the thigh and hip with soft linen cloths, so that the structure is equalized.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then start with a strong bandage from the middle over the place of the fracture, with three or four envelopings.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as you extend it more with a bandage at the place of the fracture, let your bandaging be lesser and softer, and more gentle.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then apply two extremities of a thread, which you had inserted between the hip and thigh.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind it therefore with three stellar bandages that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then weave with the two extremities of a thread downwards, until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And tie with each string, also the extremities of the stellar bandages on the other side: so that the bandage is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then leave the bandaging on that, while it remains, so that there occurs no corrosion of the limb, nor abscess, nor inflammation, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Provide therefore with its treatment, and correct what has happened there entirely, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If indeed there is a splinter of bone that pierces: then it is necessary to equalize that, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find over that, and remove that: and care for it with the treatment that preceded, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is bound, besides what stellar bandages are added to it, as we said in the case of the arm and forearm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of a fracture of this kind, there does not occur a lame limping.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, apart from what is applied to another wound, then it is necessary that the one who is lame should always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you should know that the hip is strained for fifty days, or a little more or less: all of that is according to the diversity of complexions and the remaining dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of a fractured knee joint.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that fracture of the knee joint rarely occurs, but it often suffers from sprains.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If a fracture does occur to it, then it is not unless there is either a crack or an opening in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And that is with a wound and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands upon all of that with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is thus, that what has been disrupted from its parts with fingers, until it aggregates and is joined according to what is possible from equality and facility, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put a plaster made from flour of sesame or millet, with egg whites: and place on it a rounded stave, if you need it: and bind above it a convenient strapping suitable to that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions that we have narrated about other fractures: such as a warm poultice, and similar to that: thus, so that you may oppose every accident with what is convenient for it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a fractured shin.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that there are two bones in the shin, of which one is thick and is called by the name of the shin: and the other is subtle and is called the ankle bone.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both of them from types of fracture that happen to the two bones of the arm: and because of that its restoration is made, just like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	When two bones are fractured together, the leg is bent towards all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if a thinner bone is fractured, the leg is bent towards the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if a thicker bone is fractured, it protrudes downwards; and it is one of those things that do not hide from the thigh.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and alignment, and binding of the stars according to what is equal.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, it is necessary, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having many complications: so that the extension should be minor, and your alleviation should be gentle.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg indeed there is something extra from the operation above the arm; and it is, when you align the stars, and complete your entire operation, then take two bands of pine wood, which are administered in the fabrication of splints that are placed under the tables: and they are made from hand spats: and choose from those which have a small thickness, and not from the minute ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down to the bottom.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap above each band with two wrappings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side, and another on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the bottom of the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind two bands at three places with two extremities and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when the stricture is prohibited, the leg declines to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed the splint is administered from wood according to the length of the leg, and the leg is placed in it, so that it may preserve it from motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is most necessary to do this in a fracture when the wound is properly clean.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then examine the leg every day, and strive with utmost care to avoid aposteme, or inflammation, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore something happens from those things, then oppose it with what is suitable until he is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of foot bones and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, a fracture of the heel bone does not penetrate deeply.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	A fracture of the foot bones sometimes occurs, and a slight fracture also occurs to the toes; and it does not occur to them unless there is grinding in many settings.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	What if a fracture of the foot bones occurs, and you see those bones raised above each other upon meeting, then the injured person should put their foot on the prepared ground, as one walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand there, and put your foot on what is elevated from those bones; afterwards press or tread on it, and make it equal, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then put on a plaster, and padding above; and place under the sole of the foot a small board, which has two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with the foot by a suitable strapping, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things which it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three days or four have passed, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones equal, whether they were fractured or displaced.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The treatment therefore is in these things, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If some toes are broken, then restore them, and make them equal according to what I told you about the restoration of fingers on the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then put a small stick on the toe according to the length of the toe, and let it be slightly wider; then place under the foot the board that I told you about, and bind it with a suitable strapping.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If however what is broken from the bones is two, or three, or more, then put on each toe a small stick of its own quantity, wrapped in a linen cloth: and bind the board to the lower foot; and let it stand on one head of the board outside the belly of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you, lest you should overlook, to consider all that I have told you about the remaining fractures from the accidents that we have mentioned; and to oppose each accident with what is suitable.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	About the fracture of a woman's pubic bone, and the ossicle of the quadriceps muscle, and the rod of a man.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the pubic bone of a woman is fractured, then have her sit squarely.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her towards the dorsal part of her own hip, and let it be held back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then fill the cavity of her pubic bone with lint, until it fills it; and let it become spherical in shape within the pubic bone.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman is shaken, and her back is elevated gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cavity emerges, until it becomes a sphere before the gate of the pubic bone, and the broken bone returns to its place.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a small cushion on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When therefore she wants to urinate, remove the cushion with ease, then let her urinate; and reduce it according to the method by which you first introduced it; then let it return to its original small cushion.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do that for seven days, or around that time, for the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a bladder of a goat, and tie above its opening a tube of reed, and introduce the whole bladder into her pubic bone.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with strength, until the bladder is inflated within the pubic bone, for the fracture returns to its place.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill it with lint, and let it stand for several days, according to what we have narrated, until she is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the quadriceps bone of a man or woman is fractured, then administer in its restoration, and adjust it according to what we have narrated for the ankle bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And it is not hidden that there are fractures nearby which touch hardly anything, especially when there is something of a study or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book thoroughly, because the fracture itself shows you the right way in many arrangements for its restoration and alignment; therefore, understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When a branch of a man is fractured, take the gullet of a goose: and insert the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put a dressing made of cloth over it, and it is dressed, and left for three days or around that time, and it will heal, if God wills it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of fractures of bones, when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for one who has suffered a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone or the adjacent ones, that prompt and phlebotomists attend to him immediately: if the conditions of phlebotomy are suitable, as we have previously mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary to apply a poultice of crushed zegi powder on it immediately; if you do not have another remedy present.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not put it off, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If a hot abscess occurs, then cease the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, lest you cause bad accidents to happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If the fractured bone is prominent above the detected skin: then it is necessary to try to reduce it, and to adjust it with your hands using gentle and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If the extension of it is not prepared, and its adjustment with your hands: then reduce it with that instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And there is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the measure of seven fingers, or eight; and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And therefore it is necessary for the doctor to take three or four of these according to the size that is needed for that cure in every type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round; and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it is not doubled over itself during compression at the time of operation; and let it have an acute extremity, which has an edge at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be thickened from the middle of it to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the acute curved extremity of it be placed over the prominent bone extremity; and press it with it so unitedly until, when the bone returns and is adjusted by a certain adjustment.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, adjust the extremities of the fracture to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the extremity of the fracture is subtle and does not receive the instrument with good reception, then it is necessary to cut into the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If indeed you are not able to reduce them with what we have narrated altogether, then cut into it with what is convenient for it from the incisions that we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then rasp what remains in the bone from roughness and small cortical layers.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced and finds weakness after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do it therefore.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you bring great relief to the weak, when you complete the restoration that you make for the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then soak a piece of cloth in wine, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And it is especially so in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not apply it to an ulcerated wound, nor anything in which there is oil, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the remedies at the hour of your complete restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And reveal the detected wound: thus, that you may cut with forceps a hole in the bandages according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take every precaution, lest you constrict the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times foolish physicians have done this: and they have caused to happen to their weak patients either death or decay, or ulcers, that is, sanies.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your constriction be soft, gentle, and diverse from the constrictions of remaining fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	For if the wound is bad or it is a large wound and there are certain evil accidents that we have narrated, and you find pain in the suspended place: then it is not suitable to apply remedies to it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make bandages for them out of rough cloths in the place of remedies, and constrict it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When, however, it is after one day or two days, and you see the wound has already begun to generate pus: then remove from above the cloth that you had applied with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer the liniments, and ointments with which it is our custom to heal wounds: such as the four-drug ointment, and similar to that.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every morning and evening until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary to prepare the limb in such a way that pus flows out of it easily downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	For if many days have passed over the wound and it is not consolidated, nor is the pus separated from it: then know that there are small particles of bone remaining.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	It is necessary to examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	What truly belongs to those separated things, remove them, and extract their own.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And what of those is not separated, and pierces the member, and makes the pain happen, try to cut them away, and remove them in every way that is possible to you at that time.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	What if it happens that the wound becomes infected, or festering, that is, foul-smelling, or another type of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary to apply a unique remedy for each of them, which suits its cure, whose preceding narration is in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from this point on, it is necessary for my speech to stand, and you should have a present mind when the bone is fractured, and it protrudes above the member, such as the hip bone, and the surrounding ones, and similar ones from the large members, that is, so you do not assume an attraction of it, for many times it happens because of that death, or rather, abandon it, until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then, therefore, treat the wound, if it seems good to you: and if not, abandon it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of a swelling on a fracture of the thigh bone.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This swelling often occurs during the healing of a fracture of the thigh bone.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially when it is near the joints, and it becomes deformed from the shape of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the member from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider then, if the swelling is recent: administer to it medicines that have a drying quality, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, take some of these, or all of them: and mix them with wine that is drying, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and apply them to the swelling in a poultice, and bind them on with a good bandage.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And release the stricture, not loosening it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another one, until the swelling is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or wrap a layer of lead above it, not deviating from the center.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing every swelling that is feared in the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the swelling has already turned to stone, and is hardened, and urgent necessity demands its removal: then make an incision above it from the upper part, and cut away the prominent excess: or shave it off with certain rasps, until it is removed: and treat it thus, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	On the cure when it is restored, and a member remains after that subtle one, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fracture of the bone is restored, and a member remains after that subtle one, weak: then it does not happen unless due to many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is, the multitude of solution of the ligament and its binding not according to what is necessary: or due to the excess of stricture of the ligaments, until nourishment is prevented from flowing to the member: or due to the multitude of superfluous embrocation at an unsuitable time: or due to the scarcity of blood in the weak body, and its debility.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment of that is to nourish the weak person, and to make their body tender, until blood is multiplied in them.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And bring joy and cheerfulness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put pitch on the member: so that it attracts much nourishment to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And apply frequent embrocation with warm water, until nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the cure of fractured bones when they are restored twistedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When a limb, already restored after its healing, has twisted deformity and a prominent fracture or knot, and is deformed in that shape of the limb, yet the limb is not prevented from its natural operation: then it does not seem necessary to receive his speech, who thinks that the limb should be refractured anew.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And already there were many foolish doctors and restorers who did that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed detestable, leading to death or great fear, as if it were mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and knot are recent: then it is necessary to foment with warm water, in which are decoctions of softening herbs, such as the leaves of altaea, and its root, and melilot, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made for him with a softening plaster, such as a well-made dyachilon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let there be applied an ointment of the root of altaea, and mixed with the fat of a hen, or sesame oil: and let it be plastered on with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let there be applied rich figs, and crushed with dove's dung, and similar things which are mentioned in medicines that diminish consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the knot is loosened with gentle, long, and mild friction, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let the movement of the limb be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the twisting has already preceded, and become strong, and turned into a bony hardness, and necessity has been provoked to cure it with iron: then it is necessary to section above it, and release the continuity of the bone, and cut out what is superfluous from the knot or bone with subtle incisions: and let facility be administered in that with solicitude and study.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On Speech about Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 23.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	A dislocation is an exit of a joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Because it is prevented from its motion, and the form of the limb is deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes to happen severe pains and vehement injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore a dislocation happens, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration: and not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes putrid, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Because of this, therefore, it is not suitable to move or stretch it during the hour of its putrefaction.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Since it often causes spasms and painful wounds.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then it is necessary to hasten to bloodletting of the affected part.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it should be left alone until the putrefaction subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be anointed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And the whole limb should be treated so that its memory returns to its proper place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have now arranged the chapters on dislocations, and also according to what preceded in fractures, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocated lower jawbone.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws rarely become dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs according to one of two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or indeed they are removed from their places with a small removal, and are softened for a short time.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated with a complete and total dislocation, until they become soft towards the chest, until the saliva of the affected part flows, and it cannot hold it, nor can it close its mouth, and its tongue is entangled with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When the dislocation of it is small, then it returns into many dispositions by itself with fewness.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If the dislocation is complete and entire, then it is necessary to administer the reduction quickly and not to delay at all: and it is as if the servant head of the injured person holds fast; and the physician inserts the thumb of his hand into the root of the jawbone at the place of the dislocation, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he inserts both thumbs simultaneously, if the dislocation is from two parts.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hands are outside, which are equal.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the injured person to clean their jawbones and free them for chewing in every way.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician adjusts the jawbone and pushes the jawbone until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jawbones are involved simultaneously; then administer a fomentation with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: nor delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they return and are adjusted, and the injured bone is closed, and not made soft; then place over them small pads of cotton cloth, with a cerate that is made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then bind with ease using soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And the injured person should sleep on their back: and their head should be positioned between two pillows, so that they do not move it to the right or left; nor should they try to chew something: rather, let their food be given in a soft drink, until when the pains are removed, and the jawbone is restored: then they can eat what they want, and administer it with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let them not strain over the operation of their mouth during eating and drinking, and kissing, until the jawbone is restored, and they are healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some hour and do not convert to their places, then many fevers often occur from it, and constant pains; and perhaps the weak belly is loosened, and perhaps pure yellow bile is vomited.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Since you have seen that, then know that it is a loss, and many times he dies who suffers that within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of a dislocated elbow, and the extremity of the shoulder.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The elbow indeed is not dislocated from the inner side, on account of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is sometimes dislocated outwardly, and that is made clear by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, that the weak person lies on his back, and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then bind the place with your strong palm's binding force, for it will return to its position.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put a plaster on top of it, and poultices, and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities that follow the elbow and are continued with it are not dislocated, unless rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is dislocated at some time: then it is necessary that it be reduced and adjusted according to what we have said, and what has been prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put a plaster on top of it, and poultices, and a tight binding.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the weak person to adhere to tranquility and quiet, until they are healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment, the extremity of the shoulder is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the reduction of a dislocated shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Of which one is, that it is dislocated downwards towards the armpit.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is, so that it may be displaced towards the part of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it may be displaced towards the upper part of the shoulder: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not dislocate backwards, because of the blade-like shape.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not dislocate forwards, because of the tendons.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And indeed it is most often displaced and protrudes downwards towards the buttock: especially in those whose flesh is scant.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it protrudes quickly in them, and is reduced quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those, however, whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of that, namely because it protrudes with difficulty, and is reduced with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men that they receive a blow or a fall, and the shoulder becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and is thought to be because of that, since it was already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, you should experience that, until you stand on certain knowledge of it, and then proceed to its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the dislocation is recognized when it is towards the buttock: and you distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find a clear difference between them, and you find a concavity at the head of the shoulder, and under the buttock upon touch, as if it were a void: and the weak one cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it with all its motions.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards: then you find a clear touch, and it does not hide.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And indeed the reduction of this dislocation is easy, when it is recent, or the patient is a weak boy.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, that the assistant lifts his hand to the upper parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then you place your thumbs under the buttock, and lift the joint with strength upwards to its place: and the assistant lifts his hand, and extends it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he should put it underneath, for he himself returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If, however, he does not return through what we have said, and there are many days from the beginning of the dislocation: then it is necessary that the injured person be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation be administered which softens and soothes, such as if they were soaking the roots of altaea, and fenugreek, and melilot in water, and administering it.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the injured person should be laid down on his back: and a sphere and wool should be placed under the bandage, which is equal in softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician should place his heel on the sphere, and lift the head of the shoulder with strength, and draw the hand of the injured person downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another should hold the head of the injured person, so that it does not move downwards: for he himself returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is, that you should make the strong man who is longer than the injured person present, and stand at his side, and insert his shoulder under the bandage of the injured person: and lift his bandage upwards, until the injured person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another should draw the hand of the injured person downwards towards his own belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If, however, the injured person is weak: then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, so that it weighs him down: for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is reduced also according to another method: and it is, that a long wooden beam is fixed in the ground, whose head has a rounded figure: like a mason's hammer: which should not be thick, nor too subtle.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then soft cloths should be placed under the injured person after they are placed on top of the head of the beam: and the injured person should stand along the length of the beam.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand is extended downwards on one side and his body is stretched out from the other side with strength: for the joint returns to its place with swiftness.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If his reduction is difficult through all that we have mentioned, then use this care: and it is to receive a stick whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers: which has a round head, so that its entrance may be alleviated into the deep wound, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then fine linen cloths are tied over the round head, so that they do not hurt the weak limb.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then it should be placed under the weak limb, so that the hand or arm is stretched out over the stick up to the bottom: and the stick is tied over the assisting limb and arm and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm should be placed on a step of a ladder in width, and the hand is stretched out downwards, and the rest of the body is suspended hanging from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint indeed enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore the entrance is completed according to whatever mode is possible: then it is necessary to place under the weak limb a sphere of equal quantity made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then put the prepared plaster made from mill dust with olive oil, and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it turns out to be on top.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind underneath the weak limb a suitable bandage: and the ligament is turned back over the plaster on top: and his hand is attached to his neck, and left there, so that his hand is not moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to place nourishing food near the weak limb, until the member is comforted: because it is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger bandage should be placed after seven days, or five, and exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it has become firm and not soft, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the joint is dislocated frequently, either because of the moisture that happens to it or due to another cause: then it is necessary to apply a cautery with three probes, according to what has been previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If this is done and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not confirmed, and the plaster and bandage are applied many times over it, and it does not become firm, and falls apart, and cannot be elevated to its proper place: then know that the nerves which are at the head of the humerus have been cut or stretched or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its proper position.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But dislocations which occur towards the chest and nipple, or to the back, are reduced with a push and extension using the hands; until it returns to its place, and is treated with the remaining bandage and care, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If it happens that after healing, there is heaviness in the limb, and slowness in its movement, then let the patient use a bath many times, until that heaviness is alleviated, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty also: and it indeed dislocates to all parts, and especially to the front or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: since it is evident to the sight and to the touch, according to whatever shape it has been dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you compare a dislocated elbow with a healthy one, that is clearly demonstrated to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is injured, and it cannot bend the arm, nor touch the shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary, that you straighten and reduce the dislocation quickly, before a warm aposteme (abscess) forms.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a warm abscess forms, its reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it will not be completely healed, especially when it is on the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worst in all kinds of dislocations, and a more violent pain accompanies them: and many times it ends with death.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is one of those that can be reduced, is to extend his hand with both hands: and his arm should be stretched out, and the doctor's hands are above the elbow and below it, and he himself presses the joint with his thumbs or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or if the dislocation is to the front: then he returns it thus, that he doubles his hand with his own hand, until he strikes with the base of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not obey to reduction, then he administers a strong and forceful extension: and it is, that two assistants stretch out the arm: and two assistants hold it also, so that it does not move back during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is revolved to its entire part after a double-layered long bandage or a wide ligature is applied above his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, he anoints it with oil: so that it is one of those things that help to lubricate the joint and facilitate its movement.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he presses the joint with a forceful impulse, until it returns to its place.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary to put a plaster on it, in which there is a stimulant, and an evacuation with a white ointment: and to bind with a suitable strapping.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm should be suspended from the neck of the injured person: and left for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is dissolved.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore it becomes firmly fixed in its place, then loosen the ligament from it, and leave it alone.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint is not well strung, then apply a plaster, and a bandage, and leave it alone for several days, until it becomes strong.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then loosen it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If, however, there occurs a heaviness after the reduction of the joint, and the arrangement is in motion: then administer moistening in bathing, and subtle friction, and compression, until it becomes smooth, or place over the joint a poultice made from a rich, fatty substance, that is, a ripe, fatty poultice.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bind it, and leave it alone on it for a day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and introduce it into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it sweats, then rub the joint with a tempered friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then apply to it a first application, and a second, and a third, at the time of entering the bath, until it becomes smooth.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place on it a warm poultice made from dung, moistened with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	It becomes smooth, and returns to its own arrangement.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of a dislocation by Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Almahassem's hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Unlike other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of its dislocation at the hour when it becomes dislocated, before the place becomes inflamed; or a hot aposteme may occur in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation in it is, that you place Almahassem's weak hand on a table, and extend the serving hand; and the physician places his palm over the prominence of the joint, and pushes it, until it returns to its place.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already receded to the ventral side of the hand: then the weakened back of the hand should be placed on a table at the point of extension and reduction; and if the dislocation proceeds to the back of the hand, then the position of the hand itself should be inside on the table, that is, the inner part of the hand should be placed on the table, so that the doctor's hand falls upon the same prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster, applying an emollient poultice, and leave it, without repeating the treatment.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you put it in its reduced state, after the days have passed, yet the joint remains according to its own twist; and it does not harm the weakened part, unless the hand is softened, and cannot grasp anything: then you should know that the nerves are cut or worn away.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is no ingenuity in it, except to bind it with a caustic near the site of the injury.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not benefit from that either.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	Since therefore it does not return to its proper alignment, then put on it the plaster that we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then bind it and leave it for five days; afterwards unbind it and leave it, and exercise the hand.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however its movement is restricted, and something serious happens to it: then soothe it with warm water, and rub it gently several times, until it becomes relaxed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the Treatment of Dislocations of Fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from its joint, whether it be a finger to the back of the palm or to its ventral side, then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns to its place.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then sustain the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part from which it was dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang him upside down and stretch him out until he becomes straight on that his own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore the night has fallen, bind him according to the same narrative; and do not cease to release him during the day; and exercise him with movement; and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for several days, until it is strengthened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do similarly with him, if the hand is dislocated to the belly; and bind him to that same part, and perform your first operation with him, until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do similarly with him when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the dorsal vertebrae.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When there is a complete dislocation of the dorsal vertebrae, or a complete dislocation of the neck, or many vertebrae are removed from their places; then there is no treatment for it, because death quickly follows for the patient.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the patient's evacuation occurs without his will, and he cannot hold it; and often certain members of his body become weak because of it, such as one of his legs, or two arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it is removed, because often the removal occurs to the four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed to the back, is called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment of it is, that you should consider then, if Gibbosity occurs from childhood: then there is no treatment for it, nor is there any healing from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which occurs from a fall, or a blow, or similar things, the ancients have already spoken of methods of treatment in a lengthy discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Whose benefit does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have already abbreviated it from that, whose little excuse is due to much of it from my proximity to the intention: and I have exposed it in my exposition, and I have formed its instrument in a diverse way from what they showed and exposed.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I therefore say that what happens in cases of gibbosity which occur on the front side is not an ingenuity, nor a healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in those cases that are directed towards both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not treated from them, unless those cases that occur on the back properly, as I describe: and it is so that the weak one is stretched out on his face on a level pedestal near the wall; and a moist cloth is spread underneath, so that his chest is not hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight stick is placed fixed in the ground at the edge of the stool, near his head: and another stick near his feet at the other edge of the stool: and the attendant holds the stick, and it is not fixed to the ground.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another attendant holds the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then a wrapping is placed over the head of the weak one, and under his eyebrows a soft bandage, firmly: and extend the limb's bandage to the stick that is near his head: and bind it in it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tie another bandage above his haunches, and above his knees, and at his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages together, and bind them to the other stick that is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then all the attendants stretch out to the part of the stick with the bandage, and the two sticks are not moved from their places where they are fixed: but they are not fixed, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place his hands on the vertebrae with strength, until it returns to its place: or he should place them on a tablet.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he should attach his feet to the tablet, until it returns to its place.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, it does not return to its place through this treatment, then take a tablet whose length is approximately three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And let it be placed on the wall from which we spoke, which is near the weak one, the place into which the extremities of the tablet will enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the tablet on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor place his feet on the other extremity.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And let him tighten well, until the spine is straightened, and returns to its own place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a turning instrument that is wrapped with your hand: and it is, to fix in the ground at the head of the patient two wooden blocks, whose length is one arm; and at his head on the back of the two wooden blocks.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length that is between each wooden block be one palm; and now it has been made a hole in every place where the turning instrument runs; and let all the wood be firmly fixed to the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And a round wood is inserted; and it is a turning instrument on which the ligament is wound around in the two holes of the two wooden blocks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And on its extremity is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is one palm with that which is wound around; and in the two other wooden blocks it is similarly arranged.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligaments that you have wound around on the chest of the patient with the turning instrument that is at his head; and the ligaments that you have wound around on his legs with the turning instrument that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand at every turning instrument a servant who will twist his hand with the strap, with which the turning instrument is wound around; and the doctor straightens the spine, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turning instrument, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the spine has been straightened and the place is equalized, then it is necessary to apply an evacuating poultice with white of egg.
Deinde stuppam.	Then a compress.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards place on top of the poultice a small plate made from a tablet, whose width is three fingers, or around that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the quantity that occupies the space of gibbosity, and above the healthy part of the spine.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it should be tied with a ligature which we have mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the weak person be nourished with subtle nutrition until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	What if something of the swelling remains at the site at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and soothe, with the administration of a regimen which we have described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now let it be applied on that plate of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when a swelling occurs at the last vertebra of the back: and it is thought to be displaced by that, and it is that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not suitable, lest a fatal assumption be made with this medicine: for perhaps it may bring about death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the joints of the ankle and the joints of the shoulder do not occur unless there is a dislocation only: nor does it occur to them what occurs to other joints from small removals and concavities.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed, the ankle joint is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Which is, because it is dislocated forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed, it is most often dislocated inward: and it is dislocated little to the front and to the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its inward dislocation is this: because when you join the weak leg with the healthy one, it becomes longer: and its knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the weak person cannot bend their foot at the groin: and there is a place that follows the inflamed groin, an aposteme, hot from the fact that the head of the hip joint has already arrived there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of the one to whom a dislocation occurs outward is that they are contrary accidents to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of one to whom a dislocation happens in the front is that it stretches out a healthy leg according to its complement; however, it does not duplicate it without pain which is in the knee. And if it is constricted for walking, it cannot step over it at the front; and urine retention is held back by it, and the groin is affected, and during walking there is bruising on the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of one to whom a dislocation happens at the back is that it does not stretch out the knee, nor can it duplicate it until it duplicates the groin; and the leg is also shorter than the other: and the groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this type of dislocation is thus, that you should consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has already become chronic with the one having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its natural disposition: then there is no cure for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it is not fitting that a deep supposition should be made about it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that case, however, where the dislocation is recent and is one of the four species of dislocations, then it is proper to proceed thus, so that you may join the ends together, and stretch it inward and outward, and move it right and left: for perhaps it will return into place, and not require further treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If, however, it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant, and stretch out the leg from the lower part: either with his own hands, or with a bandage, which is tied above the knee of the leg: and another assistant stretches out his hand from above, so that he may insert his hands under the thighs.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should bind with a soft bandage around the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let the extension be either from the front of the groin to the part of the flanks, or from the back to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let there be one extension of all their limbs, until the weakened patient is lifted with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this indeed is a type of extension that is a common type of four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type of that which I shall speak of regarding proper cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction of this very thing, when the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that the weakened patient be placed on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then a bandage should be placed over the root of the hip, where it is between the head of the hip, and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upwards from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, towards the armpit.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong assistant should take his arm, and reduce the large mass of the hip of the weakened patient, and extend it outward with a vigorous extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now indeed it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the remaining types of cure, by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If it is raised above you, and does not obey you at the entrance with this type of cure altogether: then it is necessary that both feet of the weakened patient be bound together with a strong bandage, gentle, over both heels, and over both knees: and let the length of each be compared to its own quantity of four fingers; and let the weakened leg be extended more by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the weakened patient should be suspended from the top of a beam, which is in the house: and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then order a strong youth to support the head of the hip: and let him be suspended with the weakened youth: and another youth should push, supporting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In the reduction of this proper part, when there is a dislocation to the outer parts, it is necessary that the weakened person lies on a couch, according to what we have described in the case of having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let the bandage be tightened above his leg, properly weakened, and above his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two wooden splints are placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a wooden splint is placed in the middle of the stool, fixed well; on which are wrapped humid cloths, so that they do not harm the weakened person: and let the wooden splint be between his hips, so that it does not pull towards the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then everyone assisting attends to their own part, and the physician completes the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If it then obeys to reverting, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place on the same tablet, and press upon it, as we said in the case of hump-backedness, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the weakened person lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the weakened person's leg is extended quickly; and this is according to the same narrative on the couch: and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the groin of the weakened person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he tightens it with his other hand, and with that tightening he places it extended downwards towards the knee joint.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary that the weakened person is extended downwards, and he should be raised above the ground: on the contrary, it is necessary that he is placed on a hard surface, as it is necessary if his ankle is dislocated outwards, according to what we said about his reclining on two anchors: and this is on his face, and the extended bandages: according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be administered with a tablet also on the place to which the joint returns, with completion of reduction according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is, that you stretch out the two legs of the injured person: and when you see them equal, and the injured person draws in his leg, and expands it without excuse: then you know, because the limb has already returned according to what is necessary: then join the two hips, and put on a plaster, and bind with a bandage, that is, a wheel: thus, so that it does not move to any part: and let the injured person remain quiet for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the bandage and plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in stature, then you know that the dislocation is now firmly established: therefore dismiss the injured person to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then return and plaster it, and bind it according to your first tightening: and let it go for three days also.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make it walk slowly on both legs for some days, until it is well comforted.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Of Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, that is, backward.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forward.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you will notice the injured person applies their leg to their hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not adhere to the hip: then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all modes of its dislocation is to make the injured person sit upright, so that they can now stretch out their leg if they can on it, and adhere your back to their face: and put their foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then adhere to its knee with your palms, and place them straight between your fingers over its knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply both sides of your palm to its knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another person should stretch out its foot, until its knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of reduction is that the leg adheres to the hip with gentleness, not painfully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply a plaster to it, and make the leg adhere to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three days or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then release it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the patient not use it for walking for several days, until it heals.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, the reduction is refused to you, then administer a strong extension with ligaments, whose preceding narrative was in the treatment of dislocation, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The ankle bone is sometimes removed with a small removal, and sometimes it is dislocated according to its completeness.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either inward or outward.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the ankle bone swollen, proceeding to the part towards which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its removal, however, is an easy reduction: and it is, that it should be extended with ease by hand, and adjusted, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of it when it is dislocated according to its completeness, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright; and another strong assistant should hold it firmly from behind, at the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you should hold with your right hand its foot from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of its heel at the ankle's place.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards yourself with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left [hand] and two fingers.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then stretch out with the left [hand], and strike the heel of the foot with the right [hand], turning the leg without exertion.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have narrated.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then strike the heel of the foot towards the leg at the third stroke, and you will draw out the shaft.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it returns to its place at the first stroke, or at the second according to this method, and you see the foot is straightened, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation over it: for it will return itself.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If, however, the reduction of it is prohibited to you with what we have narrated: then make the weak part rest on its back on the ground, and fix a small peg firmly in the earth, so that it falls between its hips; and you have already wrapped a cloth around it, so that it does not harm the weak part.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then a helper should take hold of its hip; afterwards another helper stretches out the foot, either with their hands or with a bandage that binds above the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then each helper stretches out against the extension of their companion; and the small peg stands between the two hips of the weak part, holding it, so that its body is not pulled downwards at the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician adjusts the dislocation with his hands, and another helper holds the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with swiftness.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns, and the health of its reduction is declared to you: then put on a plaster and padding, and bind it firmly with ligatures, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary to beware lest you bind the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage does not press upon them violently and harms them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	What if the bandage is softened? Tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If however the patient is allowed to walk before that time, there will not be security unless the dislocation is dissolved over it, and it becomes corrupted, and does not receive a cure after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	What if a hot abscess happens to him: then it is necessary to administer to him the treatment that we previously mentioned in another place for its cure, and fomentation, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On the Dislocation of Toes and their Treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated is adjusted with a few gentle extensions without strain, and this indeed is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If the dislocation is in certain nodes of the back of the foot, then it is necessary that the patient sit with his foot on a level place on the ground or on a stool, and stand as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and put your foot on what protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with force, until it returns to its place, and you will see that it is already adjusted, and does not appear prominent in its location.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the foot a stool that captures the whole foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten it with a suitable bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and secured from the dislocation.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the types of dislocation with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens from that, and you strive for its cure and his restoration, many times death occurs; and because of this, it is not fitting to presume upon its cure, which is of this sort, unless one who is prudent in the art, long-experienced, merciful, pious, slow, not daring, nor presumptuous; and that he should use medicinal measures that soothe only hot abscesses; and leave the patient to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you despair, or hope for health with mildness of chronic illness, and in which something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Take care therefore to reduce it at once from the beginning of the disease, before a warm abscess forms.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the limb returns to health, according to what you wished, then administer the regime that soothes the abscess: and treat the wound with what is suitable for it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	What if there is dislocation with fracture, and it occurs in separated bones, then take care to reset them, and do in that what we said in simple chronic illnesses from what preceded in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your ability, and guard yourself from the entrance into the way of fear: according to what preceded my prediction to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more permanent to your glory, and more healthful to your body among those in your time.
