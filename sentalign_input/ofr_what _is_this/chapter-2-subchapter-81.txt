of hemorrhoids
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds: either they are inside the anus, like a grain of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they constantly bleed, and there is one or more, and they are outside the anus and at the end of the anus; but those that are outside have little moisture, and constantly leak a little yellow water or a little blood, and have the color of the body; and the treatment for those who have them inside the anus is that you instruct the patient to strain to go to the toilet, so that the anus protrudes, and the threads appear; then hurry, and grasp them with forceps, or hold them with your fingernail, then cut them at their roots; and if the hook cannot hold them because of their moisture, take them with a cloth, or with cotton, or with a piece of chamois; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and powder them with some hot powders that are in place of cautery; or you cauterize them as described in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until they are healed; and if the anus cannot protrude, give the patient a biting and harsh enema to wash what is in the anus, so that it can protrude clearly; when the patient strains, and if the threads are outside the anus, the treatment is easy; and that is that you take them with your fingernail or with forceps, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and that they fear the incision by iron. 
You must administer the suture in this manner: take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread over and make the needle pierce the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide; and tighten the thread firmly, then knot the thread, and pull out the needle, and do so with all the others, and leave one to drain the excess blood; then put a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate on the anus, and put it on the anus, and instruct the patient to rest; and then leave it until they defecate, and when they have defecated, treat them with ointment and other treatments until they are healed.
of the drying of the feces in the anus
Many times there is drying of feces in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use. 
You must scrape the bark on top with the point of a spatula or your fingernail, which prevents it from moistening; then treat it until it is healed as it should be; and if it cannot heal, repeat the scraping more strongly than before, until it bleeds a lot, and is excoriated; then treat it until it is healed.
