On the treatment of flesh growths in the nose.
Chapter 24.
Sometimes various fleshy growths appear in the nose, some of which resemble a many-legged scorpion, some of which are cancerous, stony, and dark-colored; others are soft flesh, not dark-colored.
For those growths that are soft, benign, and non-cancerous, have the patient sit between your hands, facing the sun, and open his nostrils. Insert a hook into the growths, then pull them outward and cut away what you have hooked with a slender, sharp spatula on one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
If any remains that cannot be cut, scrape it gently with a fine instrument until nothing is left.
If there is excessive bleeding or a hot abscess occurs, then treat it with appropriate measures. If it is one of the malignant abscesses, immediately cauterize it until the bleeding stops, and all flesh is removed.
Then, after the incision, pour vinegar, water, or wine into the nose.
If the nose opens and moisture reaches down to the palate, then you know it is healed.
However, if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that there is flesh growing in the upper bones of the nose, where the instrument cannot reach with incision.
Then you should insert a linen thread of moderate thickness with multiple knots spaced about a finger's width apart. The patient should inhale in a way that allows one end of the thread to enter his nose using a rod or whatever tool is feasible, as long as it resembles a hook. The patient should continue inhaling until the thread reaches the back of the throat and exits near the throat.
Many times, young students accomplish similar things with small objects in schools, so this is an easy task for someone willing.
Next, place both ends of the threadâ€”one that comes out over the nose and the other that remains in the nose.
Then administer the cutting of flesh with the knots along the thread.
Do this until you know that the flesh is held by the knots of the thread.
Then remove the thread and place in the nose, after the blood is wiped away, a piece of cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more, until the ointment erodes all remaining flesh.
Then, as the final step, place a lead tube in the nose for several days until it heals.
If a drying treatment is needed, apply it.
For head-cleansing, to distill oils and other medicines into the nose, make a tool from silver or copper resembling a small lamp, open like a shell, with similar passageways.
And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
And let the shell of the head-cleansing instrument be full and open, with a handle at the back, so that you may hold it when you heat oil or whatever juices or flowing substances you wish in it.
And this is the form of the instrument.
