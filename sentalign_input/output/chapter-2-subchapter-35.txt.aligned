and if you see it turning a dark color or becoming hard, without the patient feeling it, do not touch it, for it is a cancer; and if it turns white and is moist, use the hook and cut with a fine spatula, and release it on both sides; and if bleeding occurs during your procedure, apply powdered vitriol until it stops, then continue your work until you remove everything; then wash the area with plantain water and salt, and treat with other remedies until it is healed.	If you see that it is dark or black, and hard, and the patient has no sensation in it, do not interfere with it, for it is a cancer. But if it is inclined to be pale and has fluid in it, put a hook in it and incise it with a fine scalpel and free it all round; and if haemorrhage hinders you while operating apply pounded vitriol to it till the bleeding stops. Then proceed with your work till all is extracted; then let him rinse his mouth out with vinegar and salt. Then give all the suitable treatment till healed.	0.86401355
