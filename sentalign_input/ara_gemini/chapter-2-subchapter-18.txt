Chapter eighteen on dripping eye drops into the eye.
Cobwebs are red veins that are woven over the eye, preventing it from performing its function of sight.
And the eye weakens with the length of days, so it is necessary for you first to look; if the eye in which the cobwebs are is strong and there is no other disease in it other than the cobwebs, then the plucking is that you order the ill person to place his head in your lap, then hang those veins with one hook or two depending on your skill, and the hooks should be smooth in bending according to this picture:
Or it may be two double hooks in one body, in this form:
Then you gently pick up those veins with fine scissors and gently wipe away the blood from time to time until you see that those veins have disappeared from the eye and the blood has been drained.
And be careful with the eye, do not hurt it with the tips of the scissors.
And let your work be at midday, facing the sun.
And be very steady in your work so that you do not cut anything other than those veins.
When you are finished, instill in the eye the green or red suppository so that its sharpness consumes what remains of the diseased tissue.
If you cannot pick it all up at that time, then dress the eye with something that soothes the eye's pain and leave it for days until its pain subsides and you are safe from the hot swelling.
Then repeat the procedure on it in this same manner until it heals.
This is a picture of the scissors:
The pains .3 about it and leave it.
[And let the head of the patient be in the lap of the student, and another one dries the tears and verifies the gaze in the front of the eye and its back, and you]
The basis of the procedure is that you open the eye with fixed or triangular openers, held by a skilled student, and the head of the patient is in the lap of the student, and another one dries the tears and verifies the gaze in the front of the eye and its back, and you have the choice to start the picking from the top of the eye or from its bottom.
And it's best to dry two hooks on the upper side, one at the end of the corona and the other at its beginning, and hold them between the middle and index fingers.
Then hang hooks from below opposite them.
Then hold them between the little finger and the ring finger.
And lift your hand lightly until you see that all the strands have risen.
Cut from the smaller west, if you wish, with scissors, and if you wish, with a fine scalpel.
And insert the probe on a needle and clean all the strands until they rise over the conjunctiva.
And do not cut the dryness, because tears and blood will become difficult (liquify?) for you.
Then cut with scissors what is beyond the corona, from above and from below, so that nothing remains attached except in the cornea.
If you can lift it from the cornea by peeling with the probe, it is better.
And it may be prepared in some people, and if you cut it, it would irritate its surrounding area for days, it calms down .M its pain and secures the hot swelling, then repeat the procedure on it.
