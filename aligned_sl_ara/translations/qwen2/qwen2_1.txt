The author of this book, having completed for you, my children, this book which constitutes a part of medicine with its completeness and where the purpose has been achieved in its clarity and explanation, saw fit to complete it for you through this article that is a part of manual work.
Because the hands-on work is improved in our country and time, it has been completely absent. It was almost studied and cut off from its effect. Only a few cursory notes remained in the early books which have been defaced by hands, with its reality being mistakes and confusion, until their meanings were obscured and their benefits were diminished.
I saw that I should revive it and write this article about the path of explanation, clarification, and concision. Also, I would introduce diagrams of the tools and all other working equipment as it increases knowledge and is a need for those who require it.
The reason why there is no craftsman with better hands in our time is because medicine-making is long and it should be expected that its possessor needs to have a proficiency in the anatomy described by Galen before doing so. So that he can understand the benefits of organs, their state and its mood, connection and disconnection. He should also know about bones, nerves and muscles, their numbers and where they exit. The veins, capillaries and sinuses along with their exit points and locations need to be known too.
Therefore, it was stated that doctors by name are many but actually few, especially in handcrafting. We mentioned this issue at the beginning of our book.
Because one who is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned regarding anatomy, cannot avoid committing mistakes that may lead to people's deaths as I've witnessed many individuals in this field who claim knowledge without actual understanding or expertise.
And I saw a foolish surgeon who cut into a pig's fat lump on the neck of a woman, severing some of her neck veins causing her to bleed to death in his hands.
And I saw another surgeon who advanced in removing a stone from a man who was pierced in the eye, and it was a large stone causing him to lose his sight; he removed it with a piece of bladder tissue. The man died around three days later, and I was called to remove it. I saw the size of the stone and the state of the patient's eye that made me estimate this situation.
And I saw another surgeon who was subsisting on medicine among some of our local commanders.
And there was a black slave with him who had a break near the ankle with a wound. The doctor, without thinking, bound the break to the wound forcefully with bands and splints tightly; he did not leave room for the wound to breathe.
Then he indulged in his desires, then left him for days and ordered that the bandage not be removed until his leg and foot swelled up, fearing his death.
And I called him, and I hurried to remove the bandage. He was able to find relief from his pain, but decay had set firmly in the limb and I could not eliminate it.
And the decay continued to spread within the limb until he died.
And I saw another surgeon, who treated a cancerous tumor and it would scorch after days until it grew big in his patient's hand. This is because if the cancer starts as a dark mixture, it should not be exposed to pure iron at all.
Except for a part of a member that one can amputate the whole of it.
And this, my children, requires you to understand that working with the hand divides into two parts: work accompanied by safety and work that often involves difficulties.
And warning appears in every place where danger and fear occur, you should warn of it and reject it.
So that the ignorant do not find the way to speak and to refute, take courage and prudence for yourselves, and treat your illnesses with kindness and persistence.
And use the best way leading to safety and commendable outcome, fight against dangerous, complicated diseases.
And purify yourselves from what you fear might cast doubt in your religion and worldly affairs, for it is better for you and elevates your chances in this world and the hereafter according to your destinies.
And Galen, in some of his instructions, said: Do not cure evil diseases, just call yourselves doctors of evil.
This article has been divided into three sections.
The first door.
In the first section, there is knowledge about fire and knife, including their preparation from the beginning of the century to the present day. It also includes illustrations of tools, knives, and all that one needs when working with hands.
The second door.
In the second section, there is knowledge about cutting, piercing, opening wounds, bloodletting and surgeries, including the removal of arrows, and all such matters are properly organized with illustrations.
The third door.
In the sections of reduction and dislocation and treatment of dislocated joints, and similar procedures, there is a systematic arrangement from century to century and illustrations of the tools.
The first chapter.
In the knee.
And before we mention its use, it is necessary to describe its benefits and drawbacks, as well as in what condition it should be used.
I will say that the discussion of how to benefit from a knee and its drawbacks is long, precise, and secret knowledge. Many wise people have spoken on this matter.
And they differed in their views on it. I have shortened their brief discussion to avoid excessive length.
I will say that the knee is beneficial in general for any bad mood, whether accompanied by material or without it. There are two kinds of such moods: the hot mood without material, and the dry mood without material.
As for the dry mood with material, they have differed in their views. Some say that using a knee can be beneficial in such a situation, while others oppose this view, stating that it would not suit a disease characterized by heat and dryness because fire's nature is to cause heat and dryness.
It is impossible to derive treatment for a hot dry illness with a hot dry medicine. The one who argues against this states that using fire in the knee could be beneficial for illnesses characterized by heat and dryness which occur among people's bodies. Because when you add the body and its moisture to the fire mood, you cool down the person's body.
I agree with his statement because experience has shown me that when the body and its moisture are added to a fire mood, it results in cooling down the person's body. It is not advisable to consider this matter without having understood and experienced the aspect of using the knee deeply. Stopping at the differences in people's moods and states of their own illnesses, their causes, symptoms, and duration of time.
And as for other moods, you have nothing to fear from them and especially cold wet illnesses; all the physicians agree on them and there is no dispute among them about benefiting from garlic in them.
And know, my sons, that the treatment with fire and its superiority over treating with burnt medicine lies in the fact that fire is a singular substance whose action does not extend beyond the organ to which it applies, and it does not harm another attached organ except slightly.
And the treatment with burnt medicine can extend its action to beyond organs. It might cause a disease in an organ that is difficult to treat, or it may even kill. But for fire and the honor of its essence, this does not happen except when overused.
And we have come to understand this through experience, due to the long service and care in the craft, and by standing on the facts of the matter.
And that's why I refrained from lengthy explanations, even if it would have been fitting for this book of mine to discuss the hidden secrets about fire and its ways of action in bodies, and the negation of diseases with philosophical rationalistic language that pierces through your comprehension.
And know, my sons, that they have differed regarding the time when garlic is best to use and they considered the best time to be spring.
And I say that garlic can be used at any time because the harm caused by time is absorbed in the benefit brought about by garlic. And especially if garlic is of essential strong pains that cannot bear delay, for fear that it may follow a worse issue than the harm caused by time.
Do not let yourselves be deceived by the common people and the foolish doctors, that a disease which is cured will never return and make it into an accusation.
And do not think that this is because the cat, like a medicine that changes mood and dries out moisture which is the cause of pains.
Except that the cat prefers to medicine for its rapid effectiveness, strength of action and intensity of its sovereignty.
And the disease may return at some time according to the disposition of the patient, and enable his illness, strength and what accumulates in his body from surplus there and neglecting himself in acquiring food and so on from causes.
O Lord, let the disease that the cat is used for be a mild disease and in an organ with little surplus and moisture. Like if the cat relieves pain like that, it might not return that pain and this is at least.
And as for the common people also saying that the cat is the last resort of medicine, it is a correct statement not in what they reject since they believe there is no cure beneficial by medicine or otherwise after getting bitten by the cat and this contradicts the fact.
And the meaning of saying that the cat is the last resort of medicine, is that when we have used various treatments in a disease and those medicines failed to work, then we use the last thing, the cat, which works. Therefore, from here it follows that the cat is the last resort of medicine. Not on the meaning that was taken by the common people and many of the ignorant doctors.
I have mentioned at the beginning that gold is better than iron in surgery, and they said so due to the balance of gold and its precious essence. They also claimed it does not corrode the place where it is implanted, which is absolutely incorrect.
Because I have tried it and found that it only works in some bodies and not others. The one made of gold is better and more suitable than iron as they said, except when you protect the anvil from the heat of the fire by gold, then you cannot determine when it heats up to the desired level for the redness of the gold.
And because it accelerates the cooling process, and if you increase its fever, it melts in fire. Furthermore, due to this, the one made of iron becomes faster and closer to perfection for work if God willing.
This section on surgery has been organized in chapters from head to foot, making it easier for the student as God willing.
The first chapter.
In surgery of the head, there is one method.
This method cures of dampness and cold dominance over the brain, both of which are causes of headaches and frequent head colds down to the eyes and ears, frequent sleep and toothaches and pains in the throat. In summary, for every illness exposed to cold such as fever, convulsions, paralysis and similar diseases.
This is how you use the method: first, command the patient to take medicine that facilitates waste for three or four nights on the head's purifying drug, depending on the strength of the patient, his age and habits.
Then command him to shave his head like Moses, and then place him before you sitting up with his hands on his chest.
Then place the tip of your hand on the tip of his nose between his eyes. So where your middle finger ends, teach that location with the dye pen.
Then heat the oily lamp as shown here.
Open out from the bone as far as the head of the penis or as far as a cherry's seed. Raise your hand if it doesn't, otherwise use the hammer again, or another tool if necessary when it cools down. Until you can see what I've told you about the bone, then take a little salt and dissolve it in water. Saturate a cotton ball with this solution and place it on the spot, leaving it for three days.
Then place a cotton ball saturated in oil on him until the burnt smell disappears. Then treat him with the four-ingredient ointment until he recovers, if Allah wills.
And they said that the wound is better and more beneficial when it remains open, allowing pus to drain.
Some have advised that the skin be rubbed down to the bone, and that the hammering continue until some of the bone becomes charred. Afterward, what is burnt from the bone should be removed, then treated.
Others suggest that the hammering should be exaggerated until it has a strong effect on the bone, causing it to break off like a piece of flint or small stone. They claimed that fumes from this method would rise from that spot and leave the wound open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals. I do not see these two types of hammering clearly except in some people, and leaving it to me seems better with safety. If it's the case, then the head doubles when its natural connection splits, as we have seen in other body parts.
And especially when the male's foreskin is naturally weak, and the first type of circumcision is better for me according to preference. I would apply it by performing a complete circumcision if God willing.
The Second Chapter.
There is also in the head.
If there is chronic pain in a sentence and it has been long for the circumcised, apply circumcision, cautery, cauterization, poultices, and ointments. Especially if he underwent one kind of circumcision as we described; nothing else relieved him from that, so examine. If the male's head is strongly built naturally and not weak, but he feels extreme coldness, perform another kind of circumcision slightly above that. Then, perform circumcision on each part of his head until the skin thickness disappears and bone is exposed as described. Then, perform circumcision at the back of his head in the area known as the scythe. Use light pressure and do not expose the bone for it causes intense pain to the circumcised, unlike other parts of the head. I will explain this circumcision when its time comes.
The tool used to perform the circumcision on the horns and the back of the head should be softer than the one used for the middle part of the head. This is how it looks.
Chapter Three.
There is also in the case of non-chronic clitoridectomy.
If there is pain in the split of the head accompanied by headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then cleanse the circumcised with purifying medicines for the head. Use all the treatments I mentioned for different diseases sections if it does not heal. In such cases, two methods are available for treatment. Either through the use of hot drugs and medicines, or through iron.
If it is through the use of burned medicines, you would take a single garlic clove, peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides. Then cut the pain site with a broad scalpel until there's an area under the skin that can accommodate the garlic clove.
Then it is inserted under the skin until it disappears, then pull on it with a bandage tightly for about fifteen hours and leave it. After that remove the garlic clove and clean the wound, wait one or two days then you can carry on with your activities.
Cover it with a cotton that has been soaked in oil until the affected area discharges. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills. If you want, you can do this using some of the burned medicines I mentioned in chapter eight of my book on burned medicines.
And if it is through iron, here is the procedure: heat up the iron as shown in this illustration:.
The iron is called the pin-like iron because its head resembles a pin, there's some curvature to it, and in the middle of it is a small hole.
Then place it on the pain site and hold your hand as you turn the iron a little bit at a time, so that the amount of heat applied is like half the thickness of the skin. Lift your hand to avoid burning the vessel below which could cause bleeding. Then, soak a cotton ball in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days. Then apply the cotton with oil, and treat it with ointment until it heals if God willing.
If you wish, you can remove this relative with the cutting blade of the hammer and prevent the cutting off of the artery in this particular case especially.
The fourth chapter.
In comes the chronic case.
If you treat the case with the advanced treatment we have mentioned and what we have discussed in sections on diseases, but if the treatment does not work and you find a reason that can't be done by either of the first medicine or fire-therapy. You should protect the hammer's cutting part until it gets white. You need to practice on the painful area with a line length of half an inch or so, then leave your hand once and pull it hard enough to cut the artery and reach close to the bone.
However, you should beware not to touch the movable jawbone during chewing as it might burn the muscle or nerve that moves it leading to tremors.
And be cautious and vigilant about bleeding from the artery you have cut, as there might be risks in its severing. And especially for those who are ignorant of what to do and have not been well-trained, leaving the job undone is better.
And the treatment for excessive bleeding from the artery will be mentioned in its place in this book if Allah willing, and I saw reasons that cannot be done by this method.
I have seen the body of the deceased capable of a kind of surgery in the middle of the head as we described, and I treated the wound hoping that Allah will make it recover.
If you wish, you can use the method we mentioned in the chapter of threading arteries with a hammer equipped with two cutting blades. It is a better and more effective treatment.
The fifth chapter.
In this, ear pains.
If there is pain in the ear due to cold and it is treated with softeners and all the treatments we mentioned earlier, but if the pain does not disappear, then increase the pressure at the point that you imagine as this description.
Then apply it around the entire ear, like you rotate or around both if the pain is in both. And move away from the root of the ear a little after learning the position with the stick, and let the stick be about ten points in each ear or close to that. Then treat the positions until God willing they are healed.
The sixth chapter.
In this, the strength of the blow.
The strength of the blow that is treated with a stick, only occurs when mucus is produced as explained in sections on illnesses.
And it avoids the type of blow that originates from dryness and neuralgia.
If this type of blow is treated with needles, lancets, and cups but doesn't relieve the pain, it may be necessary to increase the number of sticks by three. One at the root of the ear, the second slightly below the jawbone, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Make your stick against the sick side, because relaxation only occurs in the correct side that appears healthy.
The image of the stick is to apply its force near the top of the ear under the forehead slightly, and another one in the jaw, with its length being equivalent to the length of the thumb.
Lower your hand until it burns through half the thickness of the skin. This is an illustration of a scalpel; this was the most advanced form of surgery, albeit slightly less harsh as you can see. It should have slightly thickened steel in the blade, then treat the area with what was mentioned until it heals if God willing.
The seventh chapter.
In the case of chronic embolism.
If the embolism is sealed and treated as we have prescribed, but your treatment does not improve despite there being no fever lasting four days. On each of his head, a year and a year in the middle of the forehead as we mentioned, and a year at the tip of the head according to what was said.
The recipe for the scalpel as mentioned, it can also have a year on the mouth of the stomach to be more effective, then treat according to what was said.
Chapter Eight.
In the case of forgetfulness.
The one who has phlegm should be given the coolant first from among the large nostrils and brain-purifying grains.
Then he should shave his entire head, and a pad of thyme written in the article on massage should be placed on his tail; it is prescribed to carry this for several times as it is one of the years.
Do this at the same rank that was mentioned there; if it heals with that, otherwise have him take three years on his tail, to be placed from the top of his head down to the bottom of his neck.
Make between each operation and its operation, the strength of finger then treats the operation with what was mentioned. If you wanted more increase and it was reasonable for that case, remove the intermediate operation.
If you want to increase, remove the bones then treat him until he recovers, and have a grease smear of the form that was mentioned.
The ninth chapter.
In the fall of the hammer and relax all the body.
It is necessary that the cleansing of the head by the aeration and what we have mentioned then shave the head of the patient, then remove a section in the middle of the head, cut each of the head's bones, and remove its rear.
And three on the windpipes of the neck, if you need for the relaxation of the body more than that and it is justified for the patient, and the illness is strong and persistent, remove four operations at the spinal windpipes. And perform the operation until you burn most of the skin, then lift your hand, and treat him as mentioned till he recovers if God wills, and have it be greased.
The tenth chapter.
Involving the treatment of epilepsy.
It is only for the epileptic who has seizures because of phlegm. It would be necessary to first cleanse his brain with large aeration and all the treatment we have mentioned in the chapters if the patient is large and it's reasonable for him to take medicines.
And if he is a child and cannot bear the medicines, let him use the drills and clearing powders for brain cleaning before that for many days with improving his diet.
Then he shaves his head and performs the incision in the middle of the head according to what was mentioned in the description, and another cut at its back. And for every century of his head, if the patient is strong and likely to recover, perform the incisions mentioned in the falaj manual, rest on the nodes of the neck and spinal nodes, and ensure that the sutures are oily according to the procedure previously described.
And if the elderly person is a child, make the stitches gentle in this manner.
The eleventh chapter.
In the cut for malnkholya (a type of medical procedure).
If the cause of malnkholya is damp pus and thick phlegm, perform the incisions as we have mentioned in the falaj manual.
If the cause of malnkholya is a preference leaning towards black and the patient's body is excessively moist, cleanse his brain according to what was mentioned in the previous section.
Then shave the elderly's head, then make a tight cotton wad like a circle and place it in the middle of his head. The elderly person should be sitting upright, touching the sides on both sides. Then take one pound of old sheep tallow.
Then heat it on the fire moderately hot to the point where one can tolerate it if their finger is inserted, then pour it in the middle of his head inside the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this for each elderly person once a week along with all other good treatments until they are cured, if Allah wills.
And if you wish, let his stitches be small spots without holding your hand on the needle, but only let it smell like smoke. This type of incision moistens the brain moderately.
Then it is wrapped in cotton moistened with fat or chicken's lard.
The second chapter.
In the case of water falling into the eye.
If you notice at the beginning of water falling into the eye through the signs mentioned in this section, act quickly to purify his head and protect him from all moisture. Let him bathe in the hot bath for days.
Then, once he has shaved his head, cut it in the middle of the top of his head. Then, cut two slashes on the cheeks if water starts falling into both eyes, or from one side if it falls into only one eye.
Then, using the razor blade, cut all the veins and arteries under the skin. The cuts should be as long as twice the width of the cheeks to ensure no bleeding.
If you see anything that can be cut, do so using any treatment possible. We will provide wisdom regarding the prevention of bleeding during the procedure and severing arteries or veins.
And it may be strengthened under the bones in the cheeks with two deep cuts.
The thirteenth chapter.
In the case of chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and permanent, having originated from or outside the veins and arteries visible on the head's surface, and it was confirmed that this is due to cold thick mucus overflow, cut the same incision that was described for water falling into the eye at the beginning. A cut in the middle of the head, two cuts on the cheeks, two cuts under the bones in the cheeks, and if needed, add a cut on each side of the eye's tip on the eyebrow with a small razor blade.
Chapter Fourteen
In how to insert the nose.
If treatment with what we have mentioned in the section does not help, proceed with quick and severe treatment for three nights. Then shave his head and use the middle method of inserting the nose using olive oil. Then, insert the needle with two strokes above the temples under the hair slightly, being careful not to cut the artery. This is a picture of the piercing technique.
Chapter Fifteen.
In how to relax the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to disease or moisture, insert the eyelid once with this semicircular needle.
And if you wish, insert it slightly above the temples on both sides for two times, leaving a distance between the incisions and make each incision the length of the eyebrow.
Do not overdo your hand with the incision, but according to what causes a third of the skin to burn. This is the appearance of the needle in this condition.
Chapter Sixteen.
In making an incision on the eyelid.
If her eyelashes have turned inward and affected her vision, then there are two types of incision in this case. Either by fire or by the incision with burning medicine, if it is by fire you order the patient to leave his eyelashes if he who sheds them until they lengthen and become even.
If her eyelashes grow when she blinks, you tie her eyes with a rope so that they do not move until they grow and become even. When they have grown and are even, place the patient's head on your stool then draw a line on the eyelid like the shape of an asw (a type of leaf) using a reed.
The marking begins near the nostril, then place cotton that has been soaked in egg white or saliva under the eyelid. Then heat this tool according to its depiction.
Then, practice the shape you have learned little by little in many trials until the skin surface burns. The appearance should resemble a whole ace of spades card, especially when you see the eyelid has become red and hair has grown on the eye lid. This is an indication of your skillfulness in your work.
Lift your hand at that moment and leave it for three days. Then, carry a cotton ball with lard over him until the scales come off. Afterwards, treat him with ointment until he recovers if Allah wills. If any hair appears again after some time and the eyelid relaxes.
Reapply the wax in that place as you did initially. If hair is on the lower eyelash, comb it until it returns to its natural position and does not grow into the eye. With wax applied medicinally, this involves instructing the healer to allow the nostril to remain open until it grows longer and is even.
Then make a picture of an ace of spades from paper. Take some usual soap and unlit gunpowder from each one, weighing about one dirham or similar weight; crush them all together well, and do this with the grinding wheel so that they don't dry out. Then, spread it out on the paper that you made in the form of an ace of spades and place it on one or two eyelids. Place cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and have the healer's head in your lap.
Then place your index finger on the medicine and press it slightly, moving it whenever you feel the healer feels pleasure from the smell of the medicine because he finds a pleasure in it like fire. As long as he finds this pleasure, leave the medicine alone and move it with your finger. When the pleasure ceases, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And observe, for you will see that the eyelid has risen as it rises when heated by fire or cutting; otherwise, renew him with medicine on the place which was not affected by the medicine and did not heal until your task is complete and the eye heats. Then put cotton on beeswax onto it until the burn scar falls.
And then treat him with the camel's butter ointment or any other until he heals. It is recommended that when working, you hold onto the utmost precaution so that nothing falls into the eye from medicine; if the eyelid relaxes after a few days and we fear some hair in the eye.
And renew the medicine on that spot where the eyelid relaxed specifically as you did at first, then treat him until he heals. This is an example of a cardian's paper.
And know that people's eyes may differ in size and grandness, so according to this, let your treatment be, it is not hidden how to follow the right way for those who have a path like this.
The Seventeenth Chapter.
In the nacor place that is displayed in the eye.
If you treat the nacor with what we have mentioned in dividing diseases and it does not work, then your treatment should focus on this characteristic.
You should instruct the patient to place his head on your knee and hold his head between your hands firmly, so that it does not move or hit with his head.
Then, put cotton dipped in the egg white or in saliva of the gecko on his eyes. Then heat the iron as shown in this picture.
You should shape it like the shaft of an eagle's feather from one end which has the hook, and if you want, make the other end pointed. Alternatively, make it hollowed out like a nail; however, this hollow iron is better for your task, God willing.
Then the leeches are pressed if they are open and their juice is extracted or if they are not open they are opened to extract the pus, then a tampon is placed on it which is very adhesive. Your hand must hold it tightly until you reach the bone.
And move your hand slightly when you are about to pinch the eye towards the nose so that you do not mistake your hand or disturb the patient, causing the tampon to fall into the eyelid and damage it. If in the first pinch you reach the bone, otherwise redo the tampon once again if needed.
Leave him for three days then apply a cotton ball with beeswax on him and heal him with the dried ointment until he recovers. If it has been forty days and he hasn't recovered, apply the strong medicine until the bone is exposed, and remove what will be discussed in its section if God willing.
Another type of leechbite was mentioned by some early surgeons, they would cut the place where the leechbite is then insert a thin plug into the cut. This is how it looks.
Pour the weight of one drachma of molten lead into it. Hold your hand tightly on the plug in a well-composed grip, and do not move the patient at all to prevent the melted lead from flowing into his eye. It is recommended to place cotton that has been dipped in egg white or water on the eye of the patient.
The lead burns the site of the leechbite, healing it in a very unusual way. If the leechbite heals with the pinching and treatment we mentioned, otherwise, there is no choice but to use a nose-piercing and return the leech to its natural flow through the nose as will be specified specifically for this case.
The eighteenth chapter.
In cases of lip swelling.
Often, a condition called hairiness or lip swelling occurs on the lips, especially in boys. It frequently happens; if this kind of swelling is treated with what we've discussed before, if it doesn't work, then burn a small, sharp knife onto this image.
Its interior should be cauterized by the point of a blade. Then, the nurse should apply it with the wheel to the same fissure until the heat reaches the depth of the fissure. After that, treat it with zinc until it heals, if Allah wills.
The nineteenth chapter.
In cases of sudden, severe pain in the mouth.
If a tumour appears at the base of the tongue or in the gum or on the roots of the teeth and it is hard, inflamed, burst open and began to flow pus, this is known as painful mouth infection. If treatment doesn't work in such cases, then you should heat a small metal rod that can fit inside the sore.
Then, the nurse inserts it into the hole of the sore and holds your hand until the heated point reaches both ends of the wound. This process should be done once or twice, then treat it with the method we discussed for treatment until it heals if God wills.
If the material is cut off and heals, otherwise there will be a need for an incision on the spot and the rotten bone will be removed as described in its chapter if God willing.
The twenty-first chapter.
In cases of swollen gums and relaxed tongue.
If the bone marrow has been drawn out by moisture and the tendons have moved, treated with medicines without success, then place the skull of the dog at your head. Then heat up the iron that comes after this procedure having placed the tube on the tendon.
The iron is inserted into the dog's skull, secured by a wheel, and your hand holds it slightly in order for the dog to feel the heat of the fire reaching its tendon root. Then lift your hand, then repeat the iron several times according to your wish. Then the dog fills its mouth with salt water.
He holds it for an hour and throws him away; then the moved tendon gets fixed, while the relaxed bone marrow tightens up and dries out the harmful moisture.
The twenty-first chapter.
In the case of pain in the tendon.
If the pain in the tendon is due to cold or there are worms inside and the treatment with medicines has not been successful, then the application method depends on two options: either applying oil or applying fire.
As for applying with oil, you would take the cow's tallow and boil it in an iron vessel or a wok. Then take cotton and twist it onto one end of the needle. Next, dip it into the heated tallow and place it on the painful tooth under the wheel, holding it until it cools down.
Then repeat it several times until the heat reaches the root of the bone. Alternatively, you could dip a piece of wool or cotton into cold tallow and place it on the painful tooth, then put an iron wheel over it so that the fire can reach down to the bottom of the tooth.
And if it is done with fire, it is to use a copper or iron tube inside which there should be some glass so that the heat of the fire does not reach the root, then warm the instrument that appears and place it on the same tooth and hold your hand until the tool cools down. Do this several times.
And the pain either disappears on that day itself or another, and after that it is necessary to fill the tooth with good beeswax and hold it for an hour, then throw it away, and this is how the tool should look.
You can tamp it with any side you like, depending on what's possible, and this is how the tube should look.
The twenty-second chapter.
In the treatment of pigs' tooth.
If the pigs' tooth is infected with phlegm and cold moisture, and it does not respond to maturation by medicine, and you want quick maturation, then heat the hollow tool that this appears as with its two ends being penetrating.
Smoke comes out of the other end when you apply it, place it protected on the same tumor once and twice if needed until it reaches the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the tool according to the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days, and carry on it a cotton soaked in beeswax until what burned with the fire disappears. Then treat him with ointment and needles until he recovers if Allah wills.
The twenty-third chapter.
In the treatment of constriction in the windpipe and difficulty breathing.
If moisture dominates the bronchial tube, especially if this occurs with a cold mood, it should first evacuate the phlegm using laxative medicines. Then, improve the condition through pulsing in the region of the throat at the lower point of the thyroid gland.
Be cautious not to reach the thyroid gland, only half of the skin should be burned. Then apply another treatment at the joint of the neck at the end of its thick part. Make the applicator pointed according to the previous condition.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned until he is healed, if God wills.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In cases of lung disease and coughing.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold moisture, not phlegm fever or tuberculosis, apply two medicines above the hilum in soft low places that have drained out, and another medicine in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And the applicator should be pointed like the previously mentioned shape, and if you wish let it be a dot with an applicator called a point that has been described in piercing for earache pains. The dots should be about thirty to nearly this number.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned until he recovers. You can create a three-pronged tool like this shape and hasten its application, because you will apply it in one go to three places with it. This is the image of the applicator.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
In the treatment of the elbow.
If the shoulder head comes out due to slippery moisture or fails to stay in place until it gets used to not coming out, and then when it does come out at the slightest movement as we have seen, it is necessary that one should first get the jaw to set back. Then the patient lies on his back or on the correct side. Then, using your left hand, you lift the skin inside the elbow up to above it. If the joint has come out inwardly.
Then heat the two-pronged tongs which is its depiction.
Then heat the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and you will get a shape of four needles. It can be heated with a two-pronged tong making the shape of the needle then six needles and the prongs are on the surface of the work.
And this is the depiction of the three-pronged tong.
And it may increase this number by one, making the needles eight. Then they should be applied to the hot needle balls with salt. The patient should then bind their elbow and not move the limb until strength returns. It's rare for the dislocation to occur upwards.
Apply one or several pointed needles above the knee. The joint will strengthen and the moisture will disappear, and the patient will be cleansed.
The twenty-sixth chapter.
In the needle for the stomach.
If there occurred in the stomach a kind of returning moisture resulting from excessive mucus, causing frequent diarrhea. After proper treatment with various remedies if it didn't work, then the patient should lie on their back and extend their legs and arms, then apply heating to three needles. The incision should be made under the chest with the length of an index finger by a surgical needle, and two incisions below each side of the single incision until the shape of the incisions becomes triangular. They should not come together when they heal, and the depth of the incision should be about one third of the thickness of the skin. The shape of the incisions should remain intact.
On this image, on this amount without excess.
And if you prefer, you can make a single large incision in the middle of the stomach on this image.
And the needle used to make this single incision should be in the shape of a circle on this image.
And the stomach may be perforated punctually for those who suffer from this type of incision, which is that you learn on the stomach a point according to the amount you desire with the ink, then pierce it with a pointed needle and treat it with the prescribed treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty Seven.
In the cold liver incision.
If the liver is exposed due to coldness, dampness or a windy condition that has led it out of its natural state excessively, and the wind disease was treated as described in this section, but it did not heal. The patient should lie on his back and learn with the ink three incisions in this shape and amount, exactly like this, below the ribcage where the human spine ends, on the liver.
Each incision should be followed by an incision the length of a finger, and the incision should be straight along the body. Do not touch your hand to the needle yes indeed.
Let it be a quantity of thick skin as much as half of its size, no more. The patient should be able to stand on his feet; if he is not capable of standing, then he should lie down with his legs extended and his arms raised. This is the image of a bed.
And if you have skilled and careful craftsmen with you, you can cut these parts using the surgical knife. Be cautious not to focus too much on cutting as it could burn all of the skin and reach the belly. The skin there is thin; know this.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In the case of a tumor in the liver, it is done by cutting.
If there is an excretion in the liver and you want to know if it's a tumor within the liver or the capsule, then if it's within the liver, the patient will feel weight and pain without much intensity.
And if it's within the liver capsule, there will be intense pain and I've seen that even physicians have given up treating him. It is necessary for the patient to lie on his side and learn about the warm spot with a probe.
Then heat the bed in fire, this is the bed that resembles a mill and here is its image. Cut it with this until the entire skin is burned and finish cutting to the liver until all the fat comes out. Then, treat it with treatments for abscesses until recovery occurs.
This type of cutting should only be used by someone who has extensive experience in the medical field and has treated these illnesses through trial on his hands many times, thus he could perform such a task and leaving it to me would be better.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In the matter of the sheath.
I have mentioned at the beginning of this chapter concerning the fundamentals for making a hot knife sheath, which is to take from the long dry roots of the reed one stem that you find longest and it should be like the thickness of a finger. Then immerse it in oil and place it in fire. Then, one knife is sharpened between the connection of the collarbone and neck, two small knives without much inclination towards the side of the beard, and two large ones above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
Also, two knives are also placed between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined to the back, another knife is in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach. Three knives behind one, one between the shoulders and two on both sides of the spine below the knife that's in between the elbows.
And it should not be that your hand dives into the knife but there should be a sensation in the outer layer of skin, and some first authors have mentioned that among people, some used an iron rod similar to an awl, they protected it and inserted it between the ribs until it reached the same tumor.
The duration is as we mentioned for the liver tumor, and in this state of the patient with the knife from passing through the ribs either the patient dies from heat exhaustion or it will cause a permanent damage that cannot be cured.
The Thirty-first Chapter.
In the case of the gallbladder.
If you treated gallbladder disease with the treatment we mentioned in the previous section and it didn't work, then use the knife on three aspects all of which are correct; one way could be to sharpen it using three or four knives placed along the length of the gallbladder.
The liver forms in a manner similar to the appearance of the liver, having intervals between each piece that is as hard as or slightly more than a finger's width. The condition resembles the description of liver pieces previously mentioned, not delving deeply into touching with your hand. The image shows the patient lying on their back.
The other side in the annex lifts the skin covering the spleen where the attachment of the patient's right lung ends, and lifts the skin over the spleen where the attachment of the left lung ends. Lifting your hand on the width of the body will have the pieces lying along the length of the body.
Then, the two needles are carefully inserted until they pierce the skin from the other side. Then, the liver is removed making four pieces of it; if you wish, you can use another mallet with three prongs for this purpose.
Then, treat the wound after allowing it to drain pus for many days. It is more effective than other treatments that have been mentioned.
The thirty-first chapter.
In the case of fasting.
The liver only benefits in regular, clean fasting. If the person who is fasting has been treated with various treatments mentioned earlier and none of them proved effective, it's necessary to use four liver pieces around the solar plexus and one piece on the stomach.
Another liver piece on the liver, and a piece on the spleen. Two pieces behind his back between the ribs one close to his chest and another close to his stomach. The depth of the incision should be approximately as thick as the skin. Then leave the wound open for draining pus for an extended period of time.
Do not delay treatment for the weak after removal, until it gathers what is necessary to hasten his recovery. The image of the brace that supports the back should become cylindrical as described previously and with which the back supports shall be oily.
Chapter thirty-two.
In the kneecaps and thighs.
If they swell in the shins and fill with yellow water, it should be braced on the back of the foot at the pinch point between the ankle bone and the base of the little toe.
Place your hand on the brace, do not rub it then lift your hand without putting it back immediately. This allows the yellow water to drain and the brace should be in this form.
Then brace the thighs in two braces for each leg, with the brace at both ends of the brace and along the length of the thigh, one below the knee and another towards the middle of the thigh. There should be two braces on each thigh as well.
Leave the brace open without treatment for a long time, letting it drain water from it. Then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter thirty-three.
In the case of diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and moisture, even weakening the retaining and digesting powers in the stomach and small intestine, this condition should be treated with various treatments. If it doesn't heal and you see that the weak patient could benefit from treatment, give him a large brace for his stomach. As described previously for the stomach brace, use a circular brace and four braces around the navel with the cylindrical soft brace. Use large cotton pads or two braces on the tongue.
If I find abundant moisture and the cause is susceptible to it, cut the affected area in an 'L' shape and around each rib, possibly also adding two smaller incisions near the larger one. This treatment is effective, its benefits cannot go wrong if God wills.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the case of cutting through the sitting area.
If there are persistent or a single thick, cold, sticky, or rotten boils in the sitting area that have been treated with what we've described earlier and the treatment has not worked, cut the ill person three times on the lower part of the back, beneath the waistband, slightly tilted like a triangle.
Make an incision under the bellybutton similar to two fingers' width. If you've determined that their stomach has cooled down and food doesn't digest properly, and if you see their face swollen, make a large incision on the stomach as described before, and also one on the liver. Another one on the gallbladder using a needle-like incision, leave the cut open for some time then treat until they recover if God wills.
The thirty-fifth chapter.
In the treatment of diarrhoea.
After cutting it, if you've cut the wound, widen the needle-like incision and insert a tampon inside the same cut wound. Keep your hand there until the needle reaches the bleeding blood outlet. Do this once or twice.
If the diarrhoea is frequent, make one incision per what we described. Then treat it with ointments corresponding to its condition until recovery occurs. If making an incision large like a single big one on cotton yields better results, this would be more beneficial.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the case of the sun that is in the seat and its surroundings.
If the ill does not respond to the cut and the operation we described in its place, and resists that, maybe it becomes free of the obstruction. If one of the suns (a medical term) causes a wound and pus and infected fluids flow from him, then the first thing you should measure against is a delicate probe.
Then, know the depth of the wound with a probe. Then, heat up the rod that resembles a mill until it burns. Insert it, carefully and straightly into the sun (a medical term) at the same angle as the sun and the depth which the probe has entered. Keep burning those infected substances once or twice or three times depending on your need.
Be cautious of burning nerves if they exist or excessive bleeding, and if the sun (a medical term) leads to the bladder or to the intestines.
Be cautious of all these places. You do this when the sun (a medical term) is in a place that could be an infection, and you've determined it's not penetrating further. Then treat the area until it heals completely. If the site closes up and its resources are cut off, leaving it like this for some time, know that it has healed perfectly.
And if it doesn't cut off its resources, know that it's penetrating or in a wound with infected bones or something similar as will be described in its place.
The thirty-fifth chapter.
In the case of the kidney.
If something occurs in the kidney causing pain due to cold or strong wind, and there is a decrease in the effectiveness of the treatment, it may be necessary to apply three times on each kidney using the marmer rod which was mentioned. It might also require applying them alternately on the same table for three times, resulting in three properly arranged kidneys which would provide more benefit.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the cavity of the bladder.
If there is a weakness and relaxation in the bladder that prevents it from retaining urine until the urine discharges, then perform this procedure at the bottom of the genital area above the bladder where the pubic hair begins. One incision should be made on the right side of the genital area and another one on its northern part.
And it should be two incisions from each side, up to the width of the thumb and conical incisions at the lower back or three if needed. The incision should resemble a pin on what has been mentioned before.
The thirty-ninth chapter.
In the womb cavity.
If there is a material of cold and wetness in the womb that prevents blood vessels, spoils its integrity, or prevents menstruation, or it experiences pain during menstruation, it should be necessary to make three incisions around the genital area as we have mentioned in the bladder incision. And make an incision on the cotton below the back or two incisions. The incision should resemble a pin.
The fortieth chapter.
In the incision to remove the thigh bone.
Wet discharges might incorrectly reach the right hip, causing it to move out of its place. Its symptom is that one leg becomes longer than the other when measured against each other and you find a hollow where the extraction takes place; it should be necessary to perform the procedure on the right hip itself with an incision that's almost circular in shape.
After learning the procedure around the right hip as you do, it may land exactly in the center of the circle and the incision should be like what was presented in the stomach incisions. If this incision does not suit your case, perform three incisions with the large oil-filled incision.
Directed to dig the incision deep enough according to the thickness of the whole skin, then treat it until it heals if God willing.
The fortieth chapter.
In the artery of the female's neck.
If there is pain in the thigh, and if the cause of this pain is due to congestion and moisture, then treat it as we have explained in section. If the treatment doesn't alleviate the pain and continues for a while, it should be advisable to ease the mixture of thick substances by using honey from date syrup or the sap of the juniper, or similar items.
Then, you should heat and position the stick in two ways: either with burning medicines or with fire. When using fire, it has several methods; one of them is to apply three triangular sticks on this shape directly onto the thigh itself.
And make it deep enough for her. After each stick, there should be a distance according to the thickness of the finger, and the gauze should be greasy. You can apply one stick in the middle on the top of the thigh itself, making it four sticks if you wish. And heat it with the circle mentioned previously when removing the thigh with one stick.
The circle should surround the entire thigh and burn all the skin. This is how you use the stick in the artery of the female's neck when the pain is only confined to the thigh itself and does not extend to the hip or leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, heat two sticks on the hip in the position that the pain indicates to you. One stick is above the knee with four fingers towards the inner side slightly, and the gauze should be thin. The depth of the stick should only match the thickness of the skin.
And if the pain extends towards the fingers of the hand, cut there according to his indication by marking the spot three, four or more times as required. And if the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then cut there with one incision using a single knife.
And in all your cuts, be careful not to extend the cut so as to burn a large nerve or artery; otherwise you may cause severe or temporary damage.
I have seen two who cut above the groin and went too deep in their cuts; they burned both legs, causing gangrene to spread throughout each leg, resulting in diarrhea and death later. If the pain is in both sides equally, then they should cut them this way uniformly.
And some of the scholars among the wise have described how to make a cut for hip surgery. It should resemble half a spoon made from iron, with its diameter being half a span. Its opening should be as wide as the pit of an almond or slightly less. Inside this spoon-shaped incision, another spoon and yet another spoon are created.
And it should be placed between each spoon-shaped incision by the length of the width of an index finger. The spoons are open on both sides, their height being around a or two hand widths, and a handle is made from iron for the spoons; this is how they look.
Then, it is heated in fire until it turns red and casts out the evil. It is then placed on the hip joint of the patient who is lying on their correct side. He makes three straight cuts in one go, then leaves it for three days, applying ointment afterward. The wound should be left open for days.
It's a rare one, yet I treat it with ointment until he heals. This type of cut was seldom used because of its complexity and the unappealing appearance. Very few can endure it; however, for those who are skilled in making such cuts and whose wounds have received them well.
And regarding the one made with burned medicines, it is to create two cups resembling a throat where there are slits in the door of brass or iron.
They should have a rise of two decades or approximately so, and there should be a thickness like the thickness of a finger between them. They should be open at the bottom but closed at the top, and each should touch the other in this manner.
Then, you pour it onto the right hip and the testicles while lying on his side correctly. You wet your hand smoothly then pour water between the two circles, which is heated with a little fire from a heater, holding it for about an hour's time. The male should endure the smell and burning of it, as he will find a delight akin to fire.
Until the discomfort subsides, then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe away the hot water from the entire hip with sweet water. Then leave him for three days and bear with him butter until the burning smell disappears. Leave him for days during which pus flows out of him, as it is more beneficial in effectiveness.
Then, treat him with ointments until he recovers. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, you make a mold for him according to how it was made for the hip, as required by water usage on this specific area, and this is the quality of hot water which has been proven in an article about correcting medicines.
You take a part of quicklime and unburned clay from each one, crush them, and put them in a new pot that has a small hole at the bottom. The hole should be large enough to let the sediment pass through. You place another pot under the base of this pot, which is greased.
You pour sweet water over the quicklime and clay until it covers them by about an inch after you mix them well with your hand. You leave the pot until the hot water falls into the greased pot at the bottom. Then, collect all that water and pour it onto another batch of clay and lime which are also freshly prepared.
When the intensity of pain is very strong, it influences many aspects of medicine and parts of the body. He performs actions akin to fire with it, and there are medicines that alleviate knee pain as well such as thaffisia, honey from babul trees, and turmeric mixed with soap.
Galen, an ancient physician, claimed a story about treating someone for knee pain and the symptoms of menopause. He said that he had improved this person's condition so much that they no longer needed any other treatment and were cured after just one application.
Until he might have even carried the bath in and when he came out, he would be cured; he would take a green sauce if available. If there was no green sauce, he would take the dry one which improves with a bit of butter and is applied to the painful knee or leg or thigh where the pain is.
It tightens and relaxes for up to three hours, or until the pain subsides according to how the patient feels. After that, he should take a bath if his body smells good. If not, move on to the basin. The pain will go away and heal with Allah's permission. If it doesn't heal, repeat the process after ten days again.
He will heal if Allah wills. Remember, it's not recommended to use these herbs in such quantities unless the body has had a chance to absorb them. Dioscorides noted that rubbing a donkey's milk on menopausal symptoms can be beneficial.
The use of the herb is as follows: wool should be soaked in old oil and applied to the deepest part located between the fingers and the thumb, closer to the thumb. Then take a dried donkey's milk.
Light it on fire until it turns into a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out. Then take another one; keep repeating this process until the sensation reaches through the back to the knee, and the pain will subside with Allah's permission. This method of using the herb is called donkey's milk treatment.
Chapter Forty-Two
In the case of back pain.
Back pain may be due to many reasons, either from a fall, a blow, excessive exertion, and so forth. It results from the accumulation of cold, wet substance; this type of back pain occurs alone.
The one who experiences back pain from the accumulation of a cold substance should, after urination, expect to feel three rows of intensity on his back where there are three rows across the width of the table itself. After having learned the position with the reed in each row for five cats or more according to what you estimate as possible and its strength.
The cat is done with the dot point method, and if you desire, it can be three or four cats in the middle pin prick method on this image.
Chapter Thirty-Four
In the case of the beginning of the miscarriage.
This reason often occurs in young children, and the sign of its beginning in a child is difficulty breathing when standing up or moving. You will find on his back at the end of his spine, some bumps that have emerged and stick out among other bumps.
If you see this (difficulty breathing) and want to stop it, prick with a pin that is circular as shown in this image. Take the cat on each side of the bump equally, or if you prefer, prick around the bump with a pin point two rows or three rows. Make the points close to each other, then treat the area until it heals as we have mentioned.
And remember not to use the cat in miscarriage which results from muscle spasms.
Chapter Fourty-Fourth
In the treatment of gout and joint pains.
If joint pains result from cold moisture affecting any part of the body, if they occur in both legs, according to doctors, this is particularly termed gout.
If the cold gout is treated with the various treatments mentioned in this section, and if the pains do not disappear, then it disappears by heating. This involves applying many hot braces around both legs, with a medium-sized oily wrap taking the form of these braces.
If you need to apply a point-puncturing treatment on the man's legs, do it with a puncturing bracelet. If the pains rise to the knees or other joints and this happens quite often, then use three or four hot braces on each knee using the same oily wrap.
If you need more of this heating, use it but don't dig deep with your hand into the heating wrap; just keep it around the thickness of the skin. If the pains rise to the hips or back, then use what we've mentioned about using the heating wraps in its respective section.
If the pains are only in the hands, puncture around the wrists as if you're drawing two rows. If the pains remain confined to the fingers, puncture each joint with a point and apply it on the hand comb. If the pains rise after days to the forearms or calves, then use what we've mentioned about using the heating wraps in its respective section.
Apply them from both sides and ensure proper treatment and intake of medicine. If the diet is good and phlegm expulsion has been done, then with this heating application, if God wills, he will be cured regardless.
Chapter Fifty-Four
In the treatment of tumors.
If a hernia appears in the inguinal region and some pus and phlegm descend to the testicles, if this condition starts soon then it would be advisable to instruct the patient to refrain from eating on that day and use milky substances that help relieve his bowel movements.
Then let him lie down in front of you on his back and instruct him to hold himself until the pus or phlegm emerges. Then, push it back with your finger and apply a stick to press under the hernia on the hip bone, marking a symbol resembling half a circle pointing upwards towards the body.
Then this is how it should be illustrated.
Until it whitens and expels the evil, then pushes the pus or lump back into his abdomen. Then a servant places his hand on the area to prevent further discharge. The patient has relieved himself between his legs, under which he placed a cushion, while another servant held his legs.
And another one behind him holding his hands, then the device is placed on the same mark and you press with the handle of the tool upright and straight. Hold it until it reaches the bone or do it again if it didn't reach the bone in the first attempt.
And be careful not to push the pus while you're pressing on it, lest you burn him, this could either result in his death or a terrible disease for him. Remember that if you don't reach the bone with your stick, your operation won't succeed. And ensure that the device is gentle enough for children as well as adults according to their sizes.
Then, treat the site of the stick with fat for three days until all traces of the fire disappear. After that, use other ointments until he heals. Make sure the patient lies on his back for forty days so that the wound can heal properly.
The diet he should consume during the period of his treatment should be mild to soothe his stomach, so that no excretion occurs upon defecation or urination. Then, if he wishes to get up forty days after this, he should use a well-made girdle and wear it for another forty days. This helps reduce fatigue and overindulgence in food, drink, and severe coughing.
If this measure is applied as such, he will be completely cured if God willing. And I will mention the treatment for alopecia in its section if God willing. As for hernia occurring elsewhere in the abdomen and being of initial occurrence, if you want it to not increase, then place a looped hernia in accordance with its size. Let the amount of skin you burn be one-third, then heal it with what we have mentioned. If God willing, it will not increase. Some of the predecessors have stated that to strengthen a hernia, use a triangular plaster like this.
After you learn to apply the paste for hernia, draw a line across the top side of the hernia and another downwards. When you place your hand in the middle, do it with one circular motion using a single marble-sized amount. The first kneading is easier and better if God willing.
The fortieth chapter.
In the first section.
If there occurs in some organs a fall or blow causing pain that lasts for a long time and no relief is provided by medicine, it should be treated with a point plaster. The kneading should match the size of each organ according to its size and strength.
Allow the pain and discomfort to subside; if he is cured from the first kneading, he will recover. Otherwise, reapply the kneading because it's common for such pains to move towards organs close to them, so follow up with the kneading until the problem is resolved.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of leprosy.
As for the lepers, they can benefit greatly from it, particularly those of leprosy who have previously purged phlegm and black matter.
If you want to administer treatment, examine it; if leprosy is at its beginning and treated as stated in the section, without it declining or stopping, and fearing that decay might seize all of its surfaces, then give five types of ointment on the head. The first one in the middle of the usual head, the second below it towards the forehead at the end of hair and two on the temples. One behind on the nape of neck; use your hand with the ointment for a little while until it has a slight effect on the bone.
And it peels off its scales, facilitating the release of thick fumes from it and also applying this ointment on the liver as previously mentioned. And if leprosy has persisted on the patient and made a clear appearance, then these types of ointments that we've referred to for the head should be applied. An ointment on the tip of the nose, two on each cheekbone, two on the neck nodes and six on the thoracic nodes. A large one on the hip bone at the point where it gives out force, another above this on the same level as part of the body, and two on each pelvic area. Two on each knee, one on each thigh, two on the biceps, two on the clavicles and two on the ribs. Apply ointments on each joint of his fingers and toes as well as on each heel of his legs and tie his hands together with a cord.
Preserve the nerve at the back of the heels to avoid burning them. There are different types that rest on the bone of the foot, another on the mouth of the stomach and another on the liver. Know that every additional type improves the situation more and more effectively.
And be aware that the sick person does not experience the same pain as the healthy one, because their body is numbed. It's necessary to adjust the intensity of fire according to the size and parts of the body based on previous characteristics of iron heats.
Then treat the pain with corn flour and honey, along with other remedies, until it heals if Allah wills.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the case of pain due to numbness, if a part of the body becomes numb after treatment with medicines, ointments and bandages and does not heal, the person should apply heat according to what is suitable for the size or smallness of the body part. Let it be hot heat that slightly thickens the skin.
Then treat it with the lotion until it heals. Sometimes, a certain numbness that occurs in the back's depressions where the nerve is located and stimulates that body part can cause numbness.
Do not do this except for one who is familiar with the anatomy of the organs and the exits of the moving nerves in the body,.
The ninety-fourth chapter.
In heatstroke.
If heatstroke persists and no remedy from medicine works, apply heat to it with a slight depth according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with the precision of the microscope, applying rose oil to the tongue of pregnancy and chicken blood or falcons' blood from each one a part, mix them all together, apply it on a cloth, bind the application firmly until it heals.
The fiftieth chapter.
In this is the cancer.
If the cancer is in its initial stages and you want to stop it, you should treat it with a heated device around it like how one would rotate an object, as some scholars have mentioned that there are sophisticated methods of treatment at its center. However, I do not find this method suitable since I anticipate that it might lead to the formation of ulcers, which I have seen happen on occasions.
The correct method is to treat it with a heated device around it like what we have described, or with multiple small applications of heat.
Chapter 51.
In the case of the gallbladder.
If gallbladder issues occur in someone and its ripening has been delayed, either due to the beneficial effect of its function or because they are elderly with little blood, or due to time, and if you want to hasten the ripening of the gallbladder, apply heated treatments around it using many small applications for puncturing.
Then leave it, for it will hasten ripening. If you want to extract bile using heat, make the device that looks like this with the heated tool.
And pour it in the center of the gallbladder until it penetrates the skin. The treatment should be like this, going downwards to facilitate the drainage of pus. Then treat it accordingly until it heals.
Chapter 52.
In the chapter about the eater.
The eater is nothing but corruption that seeks to eat into the organ like fire consumes dry wood. If I see the eater in a position where it can be penetrated by fire, I would insert many small and large needles as an applicator according to what suits the location of the eater.
Then, apply it from every side until all the corruption is removed completely. Leave him for three days and bear on the knotted places powdered sulfur with oil until all the waxwych and all the corruption are removed.
Then, treat him with herbs for the meat; if after three days you see that the meat grows healthy plants without any corruption, otherwise repeat the operation on what remains of the diseased areas. The eater can be treated with the strong medicine.
It performs the function of fire more efficiently. I mentioned its treatment with strong medicine in Part One; if you need it, take it from there.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
In the use of reversed and non-reversed needles.
Often this happens in the bottom of the feet, which is a hard thing that covers the foot, and it is treated with two methods: either by using fire or by using strong water.
As for treatment with fire, it involves heating the hollowed-out iron brush resembling an eagle's feather made of iron to a temperature that encompasses the length of the needle on all sides and making sure its edge is thin. Then, dip this brush into oil before applying it onto the needle. Afterward, move your hand around the needle using the heated brush until it reaches the depth of the needle.
He leaves it for three days, then he handles the pus. Then he renews the dressing with scraped bread poultices seasoned with salt and leaves the dressing on top overnight; it peels off from its roots, then it treats the wound site with the medicinal ointment of scabs until it heals, if the pins are not twisted.
Often, in the surface of the body, particularly in the hands and feet, it is necessary to take a copper pipe or one made of iron or eagle's feathers, and lower it onto the nail or hole. Then pour into the tube a small amount of hot water.
Hold your hand and move it slightly while wiggling it a little to influence the edge of the tube towards the base of the nail. The hot water finds its way into the base of the nail, allowing the patient to endure the discomfort for an hour or so.
Then leave it, for the nail will come out from its roots. Do this to each one until you have done with all that exists in the body, then treat the places after they have come out, using ointments from what grows on healing flesh.
The forty-fifth chapter.
In the case of protrusion.
If a pricking or an inflammation occurs in the nerve of a sweat gland, or due to a quarter fever or otherwise, it should be treated with four or five quills between each rib in his back and on his chest. On his stomach, place a quill with an oil-coated mallet; for the pricking calms down and hastens the maturation of the cold disease.
The fifty-fifth chapter.
In cases of sudden bladder leakage within the body.
Sometimes, within the body, there may flow pus containing materials of cold putrid hard substance. It should first accumulate on top of every soft, healthy lump, using a camel's bow or a long rod lit from one end, or with a convex lens.
And if pus accumulates in the first discharge on this quality, it does not increase and the effectiveness of the remedy dissolves, freeing the patient from pus, except that it should be done after the expulsion of pus through catheterization.
The sixty-fifth chapter.
In cases of sudden bleeding upon cutting the artery.
Often, bleeding occurs from an artery that has been cut when a wound is exposed externally or during the incision of a tumor or organ and similar cases. Cutting it becomes difficult.
If this happens to one, quickly take your hand towards the mouth of the artery and place your index finger on it, gently pulling until the blood is contained under your finger. Nothing should escape from it. Then put several small and large oil sticks in a fire and breathe over them until they become very hot.
Then take one, either small or large according to the wound and the location where the artery was cut. Put the stick on the same vein after quickly removing your finger with a wheel. Hold the stick until the bleeding stops.
If pus leaks when you lift your finger from the mouth of the artery and extinguish the stick, take another one with the wheel from the oil sticks in the prepared fire. Continue doing this with one after the other until the bleeding stops.
Preserve, do not burn a nerve where you are operating on the scrotum with another operation technique. Remember that if blood flows from an artery during surgery, it cannot be completely cut off, especially if the artery is large, except through four methods; either by cutting like we described, or by amputating if it has not been previously amputated. If it is amputated, its extremities contract and the blood flow stops. Alternatively, it can be tied tightly with threads, or medicines that reduce blood flow should be applied onto it with a tight tugging force using the bandage.
And if someone tries to cut it with a bandage or by pulling tightly, or by placing burned things and such methods, the artery doesn't stop bleeding permanently except rarely. If one encounters this situation without having a doctor or medicine available, they should place their finger that can fit on the wound itself as described.
He should be tightened greatly until the blood is squeezed out and flows above the wound, on the artery and finger. They cannot be removed with extremely cold water until the blood freezes and hardens, and then it will cut off. During this time, you need to look for a needle or medicine.
The Second Door.
In the slit, cut, separation and surgeries, etc.
Abu Al-Khaytham mentioned in the first chapter all illnesses that are treated with fire and burned medicines, and explained their reasons and causes, tools, and examples of similar cases. This forms chapters from old times to ancient.
And I follow this path in this chapter with the same method, making it easier for the student to meet their needs.
Before I delve into this topic, you children should know that in this door there is more than what was in the first door of knowledge.
And for that reason, the warning should be stronger because working in this field often leads to bleeding from the blood that sustains life when a wound is made through a tumor or abscess or during surgery, removal of an arrow, cutting through a stone and so on. All these situations are accompanied by risks and fear, and death occurs in most of them.
And I advise you to avoid what might lead to doubt among you, for in this trade there are various kinds of people suffering from different illnesses; some have been exhausted by their illness and the fear of death has weakened them.
Due to the severity of their suffering and the length of their illnesses, as well as the impact of their disease on determining death, some have exhausted their wealth trying to secure their health. Their illness is so lethal that they are fighting for survival. It would not be appropriate for you to help those who exhibit this particular trait.
Let your caution be stronger than your desire and concern. Do not engage in anything from this without certain knowledge that is valid among you about what the desirable outcome will actually entail. Use all methods of treatment for your illnesses by advancing knowledge, and being aware of what it brings to safety.
In this, you will have assistance in acquiring praise and glory, remembrance and commendation. May Allah inspire you my children to guide right path, and may He not prohibit you from truthfulness and success; indeed, that lies within His power, there is no god but Him.
This chapter has been organized into sections based on what was covered in the previous chapters about surgery, aiming to provide you with what you seek from them if God willing.
The First Chapter.
In treating the water that gathers at the heads of boys.
This disease is often faced by boys at birth when the midwife presses the head of the baby roughly. It may also occur for a hidden reason that is unknown.
I have not seen this cause in anyone other than boys, and all of whom I saw died quickly. That's why I avoid working with them. I have seen a boy whose head was filled with water, and the head grows larger every day. Until he couldn't bear sitting on himself because of the size of his head and the humidity kept increasing until death.
This humidity either accumulates between the skin and the bone, or under the bone on the skull. Working in this case where there is humidity between the skin and the bone with a small tumor requires making a single lengthwise cut in the middle of the head until the moisture flows. This is an image of the surgeon's work.
If the moisture is more and the tumor is larger, make two crossing cuts like this:.
If the moisture is under the bone and its sign is to see that all lines of the head are open from every direction, and the water decreases when you squeeze it with your hand inside; this is not hidden from you. Therefore, one should make three cuts in the middle of the head like this:.
After making the cut, all moisture will come out. Then pull the cuts tight with sutures and dressings. Then pour it above with water and oil for five days. Remove the stitches and treat the wound with bandages and ointments. Do not over-tighten the head wraps, and feed the patient with all dry foods that have little moisture.
Until the member strengthens and recovers, another trick of the incision is to look where the bone of the tumor appears and the meeting point of fluids because it might be at the back end of the head or its front part or in the right side or north.
You are referring to the incision where you see the tumor and the accumulation of fluid. You make the cut as much as possible, knowing that you might be cutting a vessel leading to bleeding. This bleeding will cause the patient to die from this hemorrhage, along with the removal of moisture.
The second chapter.
Cutting the two veins behind the ears, known as the two Hussain's.
When someone has a severe attack affecting both eyes or the chest, and despite trying various medical treatments it did not improve the situation, then you should inform about this treatment which involves cutting these two veins.
If you want to cut them, first shave the patient's head like Moses. Then make a harsh scratch on the area to expose the vein. Next, tighten the neck of the patient with a strap or cloth. Look for where the pulse beats and the locations of these two veins which are behind the ears. Most often they only hide in some people.
Then teach him on them with the needle, and cut them with a sharp knife to bone. This should be done horizontally across the head, and if you want, you can insert the tool from under the vein and cut upwards. The length of each cut should be about two inches.
If the sweat stops and blood starts to flow in a pulsating manner, flowing forward for several inches. If you can't locate the vein by touch, you should estimate its location based on three fingers from the ear. Then teach him with the needle and make the cut until hitting bone. The location you need to consider is...
Blood is sent through six areas of the medium, and it might send more or less than this according to your perception of the patient's strength and saturation of his vessels. Then, observe the wound; if there remains some obstruction from the bone, cut it.
In order not to expose a hot tumor, then pull the wound with a thread from a cotton incision, and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Suture the two vessels in the crotch.
If a person experiences chronic or acute episodes due to excessive moisture and heat in the muscles of the crotch or severe, chronic headaches and similar conditions that are not relieved by various treatments, we have tried suturing the vessels in the crotch or injecting it as described.
The purpose of suturing involves shaving the hair on the crotch area, specifically referring to the visible vessel in the scrotum. From its pulsation, you can see it; only little is hidden except for individual cases among people.
Or when there's severe cold, if it hides from you, have the patient tighten his neck with the help of his robe. Then you may insert a needle or warm water into the area until the vessel becomes clearly visible and prominent. Then, take the clamp which is depicted like this. Then, carefully remove the skin with it until you reach the vessel. Then place a thread on it and draw it upwards until it comes out of the skin and frees it from all obstructions underneath from every side. If the vessel is delicate, then wrap its end with the thread. Then cut off a portion from it according to how far apart its ends are and tighten it so that no bleeding occurs. If the cut does not heal or does not get cut, blood never circulates at all. Then drain out the blood from six to three sites.
If the artery is large, it may be necessary to ligate it in two places with a strong doubled thread. The thread should either be made of catgut or from the strings of a violin, so that dirt does not reach the wound before the incision heals and causes bleeding.
Then cut a preference between the ligatures; do this in that moment or after another time, if you wish to seal it with blood onto the bone using a surgical awl until its ends dry. This operation can be done equally well, or even better as we said.
Unless the patient has fever or mood swings, as sealing with blood helps eliminate moisture, it makes for better benefits. After cutting both arteries, fill the wound with old cotton and place tight ligatures on it; after removing the stitches, apply healing ointments that promote flesh growth until it heals if Allah wills.
If bleeding occurs during your operation, act immediately; either seal it with a knife or fill the wound with wax and pull hard on your hand until the blood stops. If this does not stop the bleeding, place your finger to cool down the blood.
Then apply the wound with intense cold water until the pain subsides and tighten it as necessary, which is lighter and easier than cutting the artery. To do this, you should learn the positions using a thread after you are familiar with both ends of the operation.
The nurse lowers it extremely until it reaches the bone, and she stops in two places so that there's a space between its ends; thus, it doesn't fuse like this permanently. This is an illustration of the hammer.
The blades of the knives should resemble the little spurs, but they should be much less sharp than the knife itself. For if both were as sharp as a knife, frost would come to them faster and the flesh wouldn't cut off quickly. If there is some roughness in them, heat will stick in it like fire.
The flesh is cut quickly, and this operation is better than any other, more subtle and easier. Let there be the thickness between the knives like that of a finger's hardness.
The Fourth Chapter.
In the treatment of constant, hot weeping to the eyes.
If the tears are constant, and her weeping is from the sweat ducts on the forehead from outside, and no benefit was obtained from medicine treatment in it at all, I noticed that the face of the needy person had turned red. He feels a prickling sensation on his temples like that of a stinging ant and his eyes are droopy, wetted with their swollen eyelids, which is affected by the severity of tears. They fluttered their eyebrows due to this. The needy person was forced to treat it with this method, they call it the treatment with the sword. It involves ordering the needy person to shave the hair on his forehead.
Then, make three incisions parallel to the forehead along its entire length. The length of each incision is approximately two fingers wide. The first one runs parallel to the nose in the middle of the forehead. The second is slightly offset from the movement of the muscle at the corner of the mouth. The third incision runs on the opposite side.
Preserve the two arteries on each side and hold your hand away from the connection of the jaws. Leave a space after each incision as wide as three closed fists. Have sponge cutters or many absorbent sponges ready for bleeding.
And then the sharp ends of the trephine, which is depicted in this image, enters. The cut is made from the bite incision to the middle incision, and all the skin between the two cuts, along with the periosteum on the bone, is excised. This procedure is also done from the middle cut to the third cut, then this trephine is removed. And also enters the first cut with another instrument called a sharp-edged scalpel on one side and smooth non-sharp on the other, this is its image:.
And make its sharp side towards the attached flesh and its smooth side towards the bone, push it until it reaches the middle cut and cut with it all the blood vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without reaching the surface of the skin.
And do that in the middle cut to the other cut, and after moderate bleeding, squeeze the places of the clotting blood. Then, put a thread soaked with water or oil and honey with oil in each incision.
To prevent a hot tumor, the bandage dissolves on the third day. Then, apply大量of lukewarm water, and then treat it with the basilicum ointment with rose oil and all other treatments for wounds until it heals if God willing.
The Fifth Chapter.
In the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from the inner part of the head.
When one of them experiences severe recurrent bleeding, you will see two small withered eyes from which vision has weakened and the eyelids are swollen. The eyebrows have also fallen out. And in the depth of the head, there is intense sharp pain that is very painful and followed by a continuous cough. Recognize these symptoms as the source of such materials and bleedings comes from many deep veins. The best treatment for this situation is to instruct the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single cut down the middle of the forehead.
And in the depth of the head, there is intense sharp pain that is very painful and followed by a continuous cough. Recognize these symptoms as the source of such materials and bleedings comes from many deep veins. The best treatment for this situation is to instruct the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single cut down the middle of the forehead. Or lift it slightly to the side, begin the cut from the left cheekbone to the right cheekbone. The cut should go up to the bone and further away from your hand until you expose the bone when you touch all the blood with a sponge.
Separate the two lips of the cut with an old cotton or a thread from the cotton, then pull upwards with the tethers and soak the tethers in water and oil so as not to cause a hot tumor. When you have cleaned it, if you see that the hot tumor has penetrated, you should scrape the bone for the growth of flesh to begin.
Then treat it with the desiccated process that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts of flour from the wheat and four parts of the sage plant, prepare a paste from them, and use it in the growth of flesh in surgeries like these.
The Sixth Chapter.
In treating what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is one of four types, either a metal or semi-metal rock like iron and glass, or a plant seed like chickpeas and kernels and so on, or something liquid like water and vinegar and such.
And if it is an animal, when a stone or something similar to the stone falls into the ear and it cannot be expelled from within the ear, receive sunlight in your ear. If you see grease accumulating inside the pinna or the needle, then try to remove it by movement of the head or the vibration with the forceps. Cure the whooping cough after its occurrence by placing a loop of twine or wool around the ear and lifting the ear upwards. Often, this treatment helps to expel it if it does not come out, then try to remove it with a gentle spoon which is shown in these pictures.
If it comes out with the spoon and otherwise, try to remove it with a dim light dark iron hook. If it doesn't come out and otherwise, make a copper tube and insert one end of the tube deeply into the ear hole smoothly.
Cover what surrounds the tube with a smear of oiled wax so that there is no way for the wind except through the tube. Then draw it strongly and often by your breath; it often comes out in this way. If it doesn't come out as described and otherwise, take a piece from woodpecker's dung or from the manipulated beeswax that birds take something lightly and place it at the tip of the dropper.
After tightly wrapping it with cotton, then gently insert it into the ear hole after drying out the moisture of the ear. If it doesn't come out with all that we have described, start with the incision before the warm tumor or convulsion occurs.
The method of the incision is to first cut through the outside membrane and let out some blood according to its strength, then place the opening between your hands and turn its ear upwards. Then make a small incision at the bottom of the ear lobe where it is at its lowest point.
The cut should be in a crescent shape until it reaches the stone, then remove it with whatever you can through machines. Then sew up the cut as fast as possible and treat it until it heals.
And if the thing that falls into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, try to remove it with what we have mentioned. If this doesn't work, take a fine soft implement according to this description.
And try to cut that kind of growing grain in the ear with it. Only do this if you are sure that the grain has become small pieces due to steam from the ear, then remove it using a dark lamp or a soft tool or by suction.
As we mentioned, it makes its removal easier. As for the water in the ear, it should be induced to come out through coughing with a mallet first. It fills his ear with some cotton that is lying down on that wet ear and if it does so.
Otherwise, take many small and slippery pebbles along the fingers, heat them slightly with fire, and insert one of these from his ear. He shakes on each foot in that direction and hits another stone against the stone in his ear.
He continues this process, pebble by pebble, until all the water is removed. The water can be extracted by taking one from a feather or cotton, inserting only its end into the ear and heating the other end with fire until it burns most of it, then repeating another feather.
You do this repeatedly until all the water is removed or you pull it out with the tube as described earlier in the pebble removal method. As for extracting the animal that has entered, look: if it's small like a thorn and the likes and its size permits, you utilize the method previously mentioned and otherwise...
If the size of the body is large and apparent to touch, try removing it using hooks and forceps; this makes the process easier than all that happens in the ear. As for the removal of the wax formed inside the ear, if you treated it as we mentioned in the section about excesses in one topic, and if your treatment didn't succeed.
You should look at the ear in sunlight. If you see some wax, remove it using a hook or gentle forceps. If you don't see anything from them, take this as its image.
It's narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, insert the delicate tip of it into the ear as much as possible according to what can bear by the patient. Then forcefully insert it with a strong insertion. Do this several times until all the wax is removed. If it didn't satisfy you for its removal, seal around the tube with candles as I told you in the stone section.
If it doesn't remove with what we mentioned, use the catguts which I mentioned and tried them first in killing wax. You will find this in the chapter of catguts, you pour your medicines and oils into the ear using this instrument and here is its picture:
Just as you see, it is made of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top. If you want, you can make the piston inside the tube out of hard bronze, or if you prefer, take a thread and tightly wind cotton around its tip.
Then pour the oil, juice or whatever medicine you want into the tube which is in the ear. Then insert the cotton wick from above and squeeze it moderately with your hand until the oil flows into the auditory canal and you feel it.
Inside the ear, if what you put in the ear is warmed slightly by fire and be cautious that neither the object causing irritation in it becomes too cold nor excessively hot. For, the ear cannot bear this.
The Seventh Chapter.
In the treatment of blockage in the ear.
Some children may be born without being attached, and their heads may not be stuck in their mothers' bellies or ears.
And it may also expose some people to blockage in the ear canal due to a wound or tissue there. This blockage can be deep inside the ear hole where it cannot be seen by sight.
And it may project slightly outside the hole and be visible, the one that projects deep inside the ear and is not visible might have difficulty being seen. The one which can be seen should you place the ear of Albucasis in the sun. And inspect it, if you see the blockage clearly, open it with a gentle forceps, this is how it should look:
The tip of it has a slight projection limited to some of it and the rest of the forceps is smooth so as not to harm the ear, if the blockage was due to tissue that has grown in the ear canal, hold it with a gentle spatula and cut it off very gently until all the tissue is removed.
If the blockage is deep in the ear, take a smooth gentle tool and warm it slightly by fire then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel resistance along with what the patient feels from hearing loss, remove it gently.
And be cautious not to injure the nerve of the ear, then insert a wick into the ear as large as the size of the hole and soak it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for days until you ensure that the wound does not heal or else take out the wick while it's wet and apply powdered medicine on top.
Use it if you see the ear has swollen and put a hot thing in, one would expect the wick to burn out and replace it with another wick that's been soaked in rose oil until it calms down the hot swelling. Then treat it until it heals.
If there is a blood flow, immerse a sponge or a hole in cold water and place it on the ear. Use all the treatment that stops the mentioned bleeding as described in the article about jets.
The eighth chapter.
In the treatment of those that appear on the cheeks.
These blebs that appear on the eyelids can be wet or dry. They should be held with tweezers or forceps and cut from their roots using scissors. Then apply powdered medicine in its place, pressing it firmly.
If there is bleeding from it, treat it with a soft lens press. After cutting and applying pressure, it often returns if there's still something left of its roots. If you burn it with fire, those roots are burned and it does not return.
The ninth chapter.
In the treatment of colds occurring on the cheeks of the eye.
Very often, something resembling cold in its intensity and hardness appears on the cheeks.
Therefore, it is called cold, which is a dense moisture gathering in the upper and lower eyelid. The action to take when you see this is to look; if the cold appears prominently on the surface of the eyelid, make sure it moves in every direction. If it's easy to move, just cut through its width.
Then, gently remove it from every side until it disappears. Hang it with forceps and cut it off. If you can't cut it down as it isn't ready for cutting even after the eyelid has been cut through, this won't harm it in any way. If the cut is large, sew up its edges together and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, do not worry about it because the ointment will force and bind it. If the coldness leans towards the inner eyelid towards the inside surface, flip the eyelid and hang the coldness with a strap without needing to cut and penetrate from each side.
If you cut through the eyelid, it will not cause any harm. Then wash the eye after cutting the coldness with salt water and treat the area with something that binds until the discharge clears.
The Tenth Chapter.
In treating the sandfly disease that affects the eyelid.
The sandfly is a pimple that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid. This disease affects children more often, causing heaviness on their eyes and frequent colds, so they can't see the sun's light properly. So that the tears come to them quickly.
Therefore, you see them leaning on their faces all the time and sleeping on them; their eyelids are wet from the blow of tears. The symptoms of sandfly disease are clearly visible: the pimple is prominent and noticeable. When you touch that spot with your fingers, you can feel the pimple between them. The purpose of this procedure is to make him lie his head in your lap.
Then take a piece of cotton and prepare it into a thread. Create a circle from that thread with the length appropriate to encompass all sides of the sandfly pimple. Place this around it, then press on each side with your fingers to gather the sandfly pus in the center of the circle.
Then, with theawl, make a cut in the center of this dampness diagonally across without making the cut larger than the seam that exists in the stitches. As for depth, it should be that you pierce the skin completely until reaching the sandfly.
In most cases, the cataract protrudes from the incision in the form of a piece of white fat, which you can draw out with a scratch that you have wrapped around your fingers. Do this while moving your hand back and forth until it is free. Be cautious not to deepen the cut, as this might lead to the removal of part of the eye causing harm.
If the cataract does not appear in the first cut, it may be necessary to slightly deepen the cut with caution until the cataract appears. Then you should draw it out as we explained before. After that, you should dip a scratch into vinegar and water and place it on the location, then tighten it with a bandage. Some people use salt to press on it afterwards.
He places it in the depth of the cut so that it dissolves what is left of this moisture. Then treat it until it heals. If there was an inflammation or a hot spot, cool it with soothing poultices until it heals.
The eleventh chapter.
In the varieties of eye inflammation.
If a growth appears on the eyelid, it is an excess hair that lies above the natural path and under the natural lashes. If this happens, it damages the eye and can cause various illnesses such as constant tearing, drooping of the eyelids, whitening, and hardening until it becomes a reason for the eye to be considered useless.
Eye inflammation can occur on four fronts, either by burning with fire as previously discussed in the section about burning, or through rapid medication as mentioned before. Alternatively, it could be due to cutting and suturing or scraping, as I have mentioned.
You should place the eyelid at the bottom of your palm and use your left hand to flip over the eyelid. If it flips, otherwise insert a needle with a thread underneath the eyelid and then pierce the needle through from above. This will cause the thread to be close to the hair follicle itself and draw the thread upwards by pulling the eyelid.
Rotate it with a small instrument, then cut in the inner eyelid skin without cutting excess hair from the plucking tool. Start from the larger opening to the smaller one, pull out the thread and place a small pad of cotton or string under the eyelid. Then apply with a needle.
Like a poker ace, but its shape should be as much as you want for eyelid elevation because this can vary among people. Some may need the lid cut to an extent suitable for their relaxation of the lid.
Some may need to cut less of this for their specific lid relaxation. You then make a cut with the plucking tool along the two lines you've been taught, starting from the larger opening towards the smaller one. Each incision should be near the natural hair line by as much as the thickness of a small instrument.
Then, the needle enters one of the corners of the skin, then removes it all. The lips are stitched together using a needle and fine silk thread, afterwards wiping off any blood. Excess threads that have fallen on the eyebrows are glued with other hanging objects if needed.
If you choose to do this or otherwise it doesn't matter, leave the stitches and threads for about three days or four. Then treat it, if you choose not to stitch the wound and treat it with what dries and constricts, then the eyelid will elevate when the wound heals together, and stitches are better.
This method of eyelid elevation, I first mentioned it. However, there is a difficulty in this step which is that it's effective and safe but requires care to execute properly. Another aspect within the technique involves creating an eyelid shape similar to a poker ace as described earlier. Then, raise the eyelid with three needles which could be separate or grouped like this:.
Then cut the preferred part of the eyelid with a small scalpel like this picture, cutting it moderately.
If you cannot clamp the needles and you do not have tweezers, take an needle with a thread and insert it in the middle of this image, then insert another thread near the largest hole, and yet another thread near the smallest hole. Gather these threads moderately between your fingers and then lift your hand in moderation.
Then lift the taught skin as we described, and stitch both lips of the incision together with sewing. Heal it until it recovers. If you encounter a hot tumor at your cut or incision, cool that tumor using ointments like turpentine and others.
And the lower eyelid might also cause its lashes to flip, in which case you should use what we mentioned about cutting and stitching, as well as burning with fire or medication, and burning with fire or medication that is stronger and milder than cutting and stitching. In both cases, I prefer burning over cutting and stitches.
Burning with the rod is performed in this manner: you would turn the eyelid and make a cut from inside as described, then create two or three thin rods, each of which is longer than the length of the eyelid and narrower than the width of the opening.
I lent at the tips of each end from both sides where the threads grip, then gently gather them on the preferred part of the eyelid. Tighten the rods from both ends tightly and leave it for days; the tightened skin dies, turns black, and decays.
Until it falls off by itself, if you are slow then lend her again with lending. Then treat until she recovers. When she grows accustomed and the eyelid rises, the lashes do not recede. This image of the rods is made on this shape and size in length and width alone:
Chapter Twelve.
In lifting the withered hair from the eye by needle.
If a hair or two needs to be lifted in this manner, take a delicate needle and thread through it fine silk thread that is smooth. Then gather its ends and tie them with a very light knot, let the length of the thread be about a foot.
Then thread another fine thread shorter than the first within the needles, and if you wish tie its ends. Have the patient lie their head on a stone near the sun for clarity in performing this delicate task. Then enter the needle through the threads at the root of the excess hair.
And execute it in the eyelid quickly until she emerges from above the natural hair, then draw the thread up over the needles and insert that single or two hairs, not more than that.
Then pull your hand with it so that the hair comes out from the eyelid along with the natural hair. If you pulled the needles and did not get the hair with them, you pulled the needles down by the thread you had tied in them until the needles come out through the upper hole.
Then insert the hair back in and draw them. Do this until you see it rise through the upper hole, then release the needles and thread, pull them out, tighten the eye and leave it tightened for two or three days until it binds the hair to its place and flesh grows on it.
If the hair is short, either add to it a long hair from natural hair which rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer. Then you can lift it.
The thirteenth chapter.
In the treatment of the tearing that occurs in the upper eyelid.
The tearing that affects this condition is called entropion. This type of tearing can either be natural or secondary. The secondary one results from a wound, incision, tear or something similar.
The purpose of the operation is to cut that fold, to separate its edges and make a thread of cotton between them. It should then be tied until it heals. It would not be appropriate to use things that dry up or constrict in her treatment.
If you do this, the condition of her tearing will become even worse than before. Instead, use things that relax such as a ring and a thread dipped in water that has been boiled with myrrh, and cotton soaked with rose water mixed with a bit of fat, then apply it to her.
Her treatment consists in using every trick to prevent it from healing into its original form. This operation we have mentioned is some correction of the tearing, not returning the site's shape as it was originally.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
In the treatment of the tearing that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This type of tearing that occurs at the bottom is actually called entropion. It can either be natural or secondary. The secondary one results from a wound, incision, tear or something similar.
The method of treatment involves taking a needle with two threads, piercing the muscle and passing it from the left corner to the right until the thread is inside both edges of the muscle. Then, lift the muscle upwards using the needle and cut it with a wide scissor.
If the eyelid returns to its original shape and otherwise takes a stitch, place it on the location of the cut, then flip the lid and make two cuts in the inner side of the eyelid. The ends of the cuts should meet from the cut area until they form an angle. Even if it reunites, its shape becomes similar to this shape:.
And it is the Greek letter lambda, then remove that flesh as much as its sharp side is below the eyelid. Then gather the separated parts with two stitches sewn with a silk thread and treat it with the remedies we mentioned for relaxing and moisturizing until it heals.
And if the suture was across a cut or stitch, or something similar and it's supposed to make a simple cut without hair on the eyebrow area as previously mentioned, then separate between the lips with a thread according to what we've explained.
And the instruction for treating sutures if they are from above or below is to perform the work according to what you adapt to the shape of the suture, as it may vary greatly in appearance. The surgeon devises a way however he can.
Until the shape returns to its natural form or approaches it, and the disease itself guides you on what treatment and tool suits him most of the time.
Chapter Fifteen.
In缝合 eyelid with the eyebrows or cornea.
This type of suture may cause many people to have the upper eyelid stick to the white part of the eye, preventing it from moving easily and inhibiting its natural actions. It is necessary for you to place the tip of a needle under the eyelid.
He elevates it upwards or extends him with a girth, then cuts the attachment with a gentle clamp that is not as sharp as the cutting edges of the clamp. This ensures that there will be no concern for the patient when working, allowing the clamp to pass through without harming the eye with its sharpness and ensuring that you are simply peeling off that attachment.
And anticipate until the eyelid returns to its natural state and all the attachment is cleared, then at that point you should pour saline water into the eye and rinse it with it or sprinkle it with the distilled water from a camel's wound bandage, then gently separate between the eyelid and the eye with a thread of cotton.
And place over the eye wool that has been dipped in egg white, and after the third day use the camel's wound cloths until they are cleared.
The sixteenth chapter.
In cutting the hoof and dealing with deep wounds.
The hoof can be of two types, either it is nervous resembling a hard but tender leather flap or it is not nervous, resembling a dry white wetness if it was touched by iron or cut with a girth it would break.
And the girth didn't stay in it, and both types start from the inner corner until it darkens gradually until it covers the eye and blocks the light and movement of the eye. The task of cutting involves having the patient rest their head on your knee.
Then he opens his eyes and you lift the eyelid with your hand. Then, you catch the hoof with a slightly curved girth and raise it upwards. Next, take a needle and insert a hair from horse or cow's fur along with a strong thread. Bend the needle tip slightly and pierce it through the middle of the hoof.
The procedure is carried out with a needle, the eyebrow is connected to the thread, it is extended upwards and cut along the hairline beside the eyebrow as if spreading by hairs until it reaches the end, then the rest of the excess at the root of the moustache is cut with a gentle pair of scissors or a small scissor, leaving the natural moustache intact.
In order to prevent the leakage of constant tears, as you might have seen, the eyebrow is extended only with the needle itself or thread like what we mentioned. Then it's trimmed with a smooth pair of scissors which looks like this:.
To avoid causing a tear in the corneal epithelium when touching it with the scissors, which can result in an injury to the eye and affect vision. After the cut, you should put something like powdered salt or zinc dust into the eye and leave it until the next day then treat it as required until the wound heals.
If the eyebrow is not sensitive and cannot be pierced by a needle or kept in place with a thread, it often requires treatment with medication. The process of healing will follow what was described earlier. If you wish to cut it, open the eye of the patient.
Take a soft, smooth pair of scissors like this: Gently remove the eyebrow from above by scraping lightly. If you notice that it is disintegrating or being affected by the scraping, only apply a scraper to your eye using zinc dust or red incision or powdered salt and pull on the eyelid until the next day.
Then, continue the work until all is done. However, if you encounter a hot lump in your eye or a burning lesion, leave it alone and treat the hot lesion until it heals. Then, resume scraping her again until she heals. As for me, I will let grow his moustache naturally.
If the thread causes severe damage to the eye, attach that thread to the needle and cut off some of it. Do not overdo the cutting lest tears flow in abundance. Then irrigate with the red or black ant bite water in the eye troughs until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
In cutting the wounding thread and what grows as excess tissue in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red growth may appear as a layer covering the eyelid or getting close to it or overflowing onto the cheeks. In some cases, the cheeks might turn outward resembling the thread of the cataract.
The procedure involves having the patient place his head on a stool, then opening his eyes and collecting all of the red flesh using needles that correspond to this.
Or you can hold it with a forceps or tweezers. Then, cut the first piece of flesh one by one until all is cut and there's no more to be done for the eye, making sure not to harm it during work. The cutting should either be done using a burin as described in removing the elbow bone, or with a small scissors. Like how you would catch it as shown in the picture of this door, which is depicted below.
Once your cutting is done and all the wounding threads are gone, fill the eye with salt water or sprinkle it with red dust and similar medications. Wipe it with a white cotton cloth from outside to avoid leaving a boil.
If there's still a bit of wounding thread and you're concerned about a boil, leave the eye alone and treat it with what calms the boil. Then resume the procedure until it heals. Similarly, proceed with any excess tissue that appears in this type around the eye.
Except that you should avoid treating any weak eye through imprinting or by exposure, using iron. Do not engage in these tasks until you see that the organ is capable of this action.
The Eighteenth Chapter.
In the casting of sand in the eye.
The sand in the eye. Blood vessels weave inside the eye, preventing vision and weakening the eye with prolonged days. It is necessary for you to first look, if the eye with sand is strong and has no other disease besides sand.
Then, the casting is as follows: you instruct the patient to place his head on your hand, then hang those blood vessels with a single chain or two chains according to your judgment. The chains should bend gently in this manner:.
Or, you can have two double chains in one body like this:
Then, using a gentle scalpel, you delicately lift those blood vessels and wipe out the blood gradually until you see that these vessels have disappeared and the blood has dissipated. Be cautious not to harm the eye with the edges of the scalpel. Your work should occupy half the day facing the sun.
Your work must be meticulous, ensuring that you do not cut any other vessels. After completing your task, pinch the green or red inner eyelid so it can eat up whatever remaining sand is left. If you are unable to remove all of the sand in one go, use a bandage to soothe the eye's pain.
Leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and the swelling has gone down. Then, redo this treatment on her with the same eye in this way so that she can be cured of this scalpel pain.
And leave him [the pupil would be in the stone of the learner and the other would weep tears and achieve vision both in front of the eye and behind it] at the practice where you open the eye with fixed or triangular openings that the disciple holds.
Facing, the pupil would be in the stone of the learner and the other would weep tears that achieve vision both at the front of the eye and behind it. By choice you might start by pinching from above the eye or below it, but generally two lines are pinched on the highest handle with one ending at the end of the crown and the other at its beginning.
And hold it between the middle and the ring finger, then attach tubes from under these two. Then hold it between the wrist and the thumb, and move your hand a light shake until you see all the joints have risen up. Cut from the smallest western corner if you use scissors, or with a gentle sharp tool if you use another method.
And insert the needle through the thread, and pull all threads until it rises evenly above the surface. Do not cut the weeping. For fear of tears and blood may spill on you.
Then cut with scissors what is above and below the crown until there's no stub left except in the cornea. If possible, you can lift it from the cornea using a scalpel; this is better but may be different for some people.
And after cutting it, there would be a shaving for days that settles and relieves its pain. Then prepare the procedure again.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In retracting the down feather towards the nose.
Doctors name the feather 'nasour', if it is treated with fire or with the burned hot medicine as previously described, and if it does not heal, then there is only one solution; to cut into the tumor when it's ripe and extract all of its moisture or pus.
Until the bone is revealed. If the bone is revealed and you see decay or blackness within, clean it with this tool.
And the bone chisel is called, its head made of Indian iron. It has a smooth tip like a rasp with fine grooves engraved on it. You place it on the diseased area of the bone and turn it between your fingers as you slightly move your hand to determine that this decay has been removed.
You will do this several times. Then, you apply the compressing medicine on the wound. If it closes and new flesh begins to grow there, and if the healing process is uninterrupted for a period of time (let's say 40 days), and if no new issue arises after that,
Understand that if it heals, there is no other trick but to insert the tusk back into the nasal cavity in this manner. If you expose the bone again with iron or a strong medicine when it is exposed, take out a piece of wood like this:
The point of the mallet should be triangular and rounded down to the tip as you see it, then place it on the bone itself. This should be close to your nose and slightly away from your eye with your hand. Then guide your tool with your hand until it penetrates the bone and is felt by the surgeon.
So when you hold your hand over your nose, you will find that the wind comes out. At this point, apply the compressed and dried medicine as I taught you. If new flesh grows and the area hardens, the substance that was flowing outside returns to the nasal passage, making it easier for the surgeon if God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Increase the watering of the eye.
If you treat the eye with its single dose and it does not cause harm or shortage to the vision, it should be made easier then detailed in the treatment. It must then be placed appropriately in the eyelid without a condition, extracting it delicately.
Then place a soft poultice made from garlic, patience and milk on the eye. Pull up the eyelid with many pads above it. The recipe for the pads is to take many soft burnt substances which curve each incision into four layers creating numerous ones.
Place one layer upon another according to what the eye requires, then pull it tight with a hard prong tightly. Re-apply the poultice without any condition. Then remove the poultice and leave the eye constricted for a day and night.
If the ligament relaxes during this time, it should be pulled gently. Remove the bandage after one day and night as we said. If I see that the eye has returned, otherwise reapply the pads, the prongs, pulling and poultice until it returns.
The twenty-first chapter.
In cutting the anbaria (a type of fruit).
If a fissure appears in the anbaria layer, then apply it and protrudes outside the eyelids like grapes causing disfigurement of human appearance. If you want to cut it, do so according to what I describe.
He is to insert a needle from the bottom up at the base of the anbaria, then insert another needle with a loop on one side of the wound and thread it, leaving the first needle in its place.
Then cut the place of the doubled suture thread, and tie some cotton around the needle with it. Then tighten it firmly, remove the needle, and place wool moistened with egg white on the eye. Leave it until the threads with the cotton fall off. Then treat the eye to strengthen it.
Until the wound heals, and tighten the cotton in every direction from a loop with each thread so that the eye becomes stronger firmly. Then you use a very fine scissor reaching into the eye socket to let the white liquid flow out, the eye will go down and swell then tighten it until it heals.
The Second Twenty-First Chapter.
In the treatment of colic.
This condition, which is called colic, is a period when certain substances accumulate in the eye resembling water that has been collected but lacks moisture. The reason for this action is to hold the head of the patient upright on a throne-like seat, then you take the head using both your hands from each side.
And move it until you see the substance go down in your eye, then fix it and don't remove it. The light emerges and the patient sees things as he used to see them. If it doesn't go down below, we know that it is water. If the process of going down hasn't happened with what we have mentioned.
Otherwise, have the patient sit between your hands. Then take a very fine scissor and make a small cut above the corneal membrane when it meets the corneal membrane at the sclera edge so that the material can come out.
If it comes out, let there be hot water in the eye that has mixed with honey or boiled and honeyed water. Then treat with all other treatments until it heals.
Chapter Thirteen
We have mentioned types of water in the division, and which ones are suitable for irrigation with clear, explanatory language. Take it from there for your health's sake, then when you do this, you should sit properly facing light, close to the sun.
And she ties the right eye correctly and tightens it with a good pull, then lifts her left eyelid with your left hand if the eye containing water is the left one or your right hand if the eye is the right one.
Then, you place the tip of the cup near the eyelash with a slight pressure on the white part of the eye from the side of the inner corner. Then push the cup with strength while you guide it with your hand until it penetrates into the white part of the eye and feel that the cup has reached an empty thing.
It is necessary that the depth of the cup's passage should be equal to the distance from the child to the last black part, which is the eyelash. The copper will appear in the same sight as the eye due to the clarity of the corneal membrane, then you move the cup upwards to the place where the water is located.
Then, press it down repeatedly. If the water begins to drip from its container, the sand will see what was opened before his eyes from his container and the cup is in his eye, then he rests for a while. If the water rises again, he lets it drop down again without removing the cup.
And when it stabilizes and does not rise, gently remove the cup with your hand a little at a time. Then dissolve a little of the purified rock salt in water and wash the eye from inside. After that, place all over or swab wool soaked outside the eye, as needed.
Oil, secretion of the testicles, and egg white are used in surgery. They are tied to the correct eye. However, we and those of our time place ground nutmeg with egg white on it. If the pungent nutmeg does not penetrate the eye due to its hardness, some people have eyes that are extremely hard. You should take the forceps which is called 'the bird' and this is its picture:.
Use it to pierce the ear just through the opening, don't deepen the hole; it is only that you should gently touch the part where the needle enters. Then introduce the needle as we have explained. When your work is complete, lay out a bed for the patient who will be lying on his back in a dark room.
Avoid all movements and coughing, make his food soft for his digestion, don't allow him to move his head left or right at all. The bandage should remain in place until the third day, then release him in that dark room, testing his sight.
Show him objects then tighten the bandage until the seventh day. It should not be done during treatment or immediately after piercing but it should be avoided before the water rises quickly due to intense sight.
If there appears a hot tumor, it may be necessary to release the eye before the seventh day. This can be done as long as what calms the tumor settles until it actually does calm down, then you should allow him sight and place a turban over his face so he practices seeing from under it for days while he's in that dark room, and then.
He leaves the house gradually and behaves according to his circumstances. Remember that piercing is not done without the learner relying on observation sometimes; at times he performs work, and I have heard from some Iraqis that they create a pierced eye in Iraq which absorbs water.
I have not seen anyone in our country do this, nor have I read it in any of the early books. Perhaps this is new, and here are illustrations of types of medical errors to stand before due to their ignorance.
It is made specifically of copper, and its end has this particular fineness, it is triangular at the tip, sharp.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of the nasally growing flesh.
It may grow in the nose various kinds of flesh that resemble two spiders with many legs, and some of it is cancerous flesh that has hardened like black dye. And there are others that are fatty flesh not like that.
If this soft flesh is not poisonous or cancerous, it should be made to face the sun between your hands after opening its mouth and pouring vinegar into these meats. Then remove them then cut what you have seen from them with a very sharp fine blade on one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone, if there is something left that you cannot cut, scrape it off with one of the gentle machines until nothing remains. If blood overcomes or a tumor appears hot.
Match it with what should be or was from cancerous tumors, so go ahead and remove its head until the bleeding stops and all the flesh goes away. Then put it in the nose after cutting, a little water or drink, if the nostril opens up and draws moisture to the throat.
Learn that he/she has been cured, if the moisture did not reach as it should have, then learn that there is growing flesh on top of the crumbling bones which the machine could not cut to. Then, when this happens, take a thread from cotton which has some thickness.
In it, many knots are tied and there is a distance between each knot of up to an inch or less. The skillful one then inserts the single thread's end into his nose using a hook or whatever he can after making it like a button and drawing on air until it reaches the nostril.
And it comes out through the mouth ring, and often boys in scribes do this action frequently. It is an easy task for those who desire it, then both ends of the thread which came out from the mouth and the other that stayed in the nose are brought together.
Then, by spreading the flesh with the knots on the string, she performs this until she learns that the flesh has been cut by the string's knot. Then she removes the string and is in the nose after wiping off the bleeding filaments it sucked from the Egyptian ointment. She does this for three days or more.
Until the ointment eats all that is left of the flesh, then the last thing in the nose is a lead tube for days until it heals. If he needs treatment, she used this to dry him off.
This is an image of the nasal applicator with which fluids and medicines drip in the nose:.
He places one made of silver or brass, resembling a small candle somewhat open and greased, with its channel also being greased.
And if you wish, the tube can be made closed like a tube and the surface of the nasal applicator is smoothly greased.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, one would hold it when heating the grease or any other liquid substances as desired.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
In the nasal flora at the tip of the nose.
It frequently grows in the end of the nose a polyp that increases and gets bigger over time until it spoils its appearance.
Therefore, it should be cut as soon as it appears and all of it should be removed. Then, apply either cautery or burned medicine which replaces the use of cautery to the area. If not cut on time, if it gets bigger, observe whether it is hard like a small piece of skin with little sensitivity.
Do not expose it to iron as it is a cancerous tumor. I have seen many cases where the tumor returned with great severity after its removal from its owner, and if the tumor is soft and not like a small piece of skin, I have observed that removing all of it might be possible. Empty the pus and cut it without hesitation or fear, then treat the area with what dries and constricts until it heals.
The twenty-sixth chapter.
In sewing the nose, lips, and ear. If its connection has divided from the wound or something like that, know that when there's a division in any of these organs, only some people are affected by such operations.
If you are to expose someone to something of that kind, observe whether the wound is soft with its blood, then stitch together both lips of the wound and treat until it heals. If there has been a division in the connection, splitting both lips, making each cut healthy, then you should remove all cuts by scraping off the outer skin until it bleeds.
Then stitch the lips together, pull it tight, apply on them crushed garlic and curd mixed, place a layer of camphor paste or any other kind of ointment above it, let this be tightly wound for two to three days, then remove it.
The medication is changed and removed until the threads detach from themselves, then it is treated with ointment until healing occurs. The sewing process involves gathering and spreading apart the connection either through needles as we described in abdominal surgery or by threads as I explained to you there.
The twenty-seventh chapter.
In removing the knot that is displayed in the lips.
Many people may present with small, solid tumors in their mouths that resemble some pustules of the cherry, and some are smaller or larger. It is necessary to turn the lip, cut through each knot, and attach it to the suture thread.
And cut it from every side, then fill the place after cutting with a paste of powder to stop the bleeding, and afterwards rinse with vinegar. Use salt in treating the places until healing occurs for the surgical wounds.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In removing excess flesh in the gums.
Often, there appears excess flesh in the gums which the ancients called aphthae. It should be attached to a suture thread or held by a file and cut at its root. Allow the bleeding to stop for some time, then place on the area a paste powder.
Or one of the compressed thorns that has been dried; if this flesh returns after treatment, it often comes back, so cut it again and cauterize it. It does not return after burning.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
In removing teeth with iron.
Foul, coarse scales may accumulate on the surfaces of teeth from inside and outside, as well as between gums. These can discolor and turn yellowish-green to such an extent that decay spreads into the gums and affects the teeth themselves.
In order to do this, you need to place the patient with their back between your hands and head on your block. You must remove all scales, teeth that have shown their shells or resemble sand, until nothing remains of them, similarly for soot, green leaves, chalk and other substances until you cleanse.
If the first cleaning is not enough, then repeat the process on the next day and again, and a third time until you achieve what you desire. Remember that scales require variously patterned cleanings of many shapes according to what suits your work.
To ensure that the tool used to clean scales from inside differs from the one used to clean from outside, and that those cleaning between scales is of another pattern altogether, there are several patterns of cleaning tools you should have all prepared.
Chapter Thirty.
In拔出牙齿.
It is necessary to treat the scales on his back with every possible method and avoid extracting them, for there is no behind if they are extracted, because it is a noble essence. Even if it was necessary to extract it,
If the patient decides to have his scales removed, you should firmly attach them until your scales are healed. Often, the pain deceives the patient and they believe that he is in the correct scales, causing him to extract them. Then the pain does not disappear until the patient's scales are extracted, as we have seen repeatedly from the actions of cutlers.
If the pain in your scales heals specifically, then at that point it is necessary to cut around the tooth with a prong where there is some strength until the gums come off from every side. Then you should move it gently using your fingers or soft combs at first, gradually until it loosens.
Then he enabled the two large dogs to bind him well, with the head of the patient between his knees which he had scraped and is not moving. Then draw the penis straight so as not to break it, if it does not come out or else take one of these tools and gently insert it under him from each side while moving it in the same way as at first.
And if the penis is impaled or stuck, it should be filled with a splinter and sealed tightly with a soft needle tip so as not to detach during your pull on it with the handles. And you should gently probe around the gum with a tool from every side smoothly.
And conserve your strength so as not to break it, for some will return to the patient with a pain that is greater than his first, and do not do what the ignorant butchers do on their bridge by removing it without using what we have described.
Very often, they cause great discomfort to people rather than it being broken and leaving the entire root or part of it. Otherwise, some of the jaw bone may be extracted as we have seen repeatedly, then gargle after its removal with a drink or a paste of salt and water, if bleeding occurs from that spot, which often happens, squish something of the garlic paste and fill in the spot.
Otherwise, suck if garlic doesn't benefit you, the soft picture of the handles that moves the penis first is long-handled and short-cued thick to not bend when grabbing it with the handle. This is the picture of the large handles:.
It should be like what you see, thick with the handles even if you grab them they do not bend or are short-ended. It should be made of Indian iron or hardened steel that is smooth at its ends and on one of it there are tines that enter each other to grasp firmly and tightly.
And limbs can be made like a clamp, thus they are also strong in control.
Chapter Five and Thirteen.
In removing the roots of nails and extracting broken jaws bones.
If the root of the nail remains after extraction and it has broken, it is necessary to place cotton dipped in fat for a day or two until the area relaxes. Then, you can insert the pincers or tweezers into the spot. Those that resemble their ends like the mouth of a bird called the bell-jar, and this is an illustration of the tweezers:.
They can be made like a pair of forceps from the inside or like an awl. If you cannot use these tweezers for extraction, it may be necessary to dig into the root and expose all the flesh with the bone remover tool as illustrated here:.
The short ends are slightly thick and not slippery, so they don't break easily. If the root comes out with this method or otherwise, resort to these other tools illustrated here, the first one has a triangular tip with some thickness:.
Illustration of a gentle triangular tool:.
We may also use this tool with its two prongs, as illustrated here:
And other tools and hammers that are mentioned in the chapter on nails, we may also use this large forge tool as illustrated here:.
The triangular tool is sharpened at its tip, slightly thick so it doesn't break easily and not slippery. Know that tools for nails are numerous, as are other tools. The artisan of the craft who understands his craft may invent for himself tools according to what the work and diseases themselves indicate.
Because there are diseases for which their early symptoms do not indicate the types of differences, if a bone in the jaw breaks or from one of the bones of the mouth or rots, seek to find its place with anything suitable from these devices and mechanisms that were mentioned in extracting the fundamentals.
And we rely on this pair of his pictures:.
There will be some slight tightness which helps to adjust the bone so it doesn't escape until the bone is removed, and we force the position with medicines suitable for that. If there's rot in the bone, remove it from its rot and blackness until it cleans up, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
In spreading the sprouting teeth onto another one.
If teeth sprout out of their natural channel, they become disfigured in appearance. This is especially noticeable in women and slaves where if one tooth has grown behind another tooth.
If it cannot be spread or withdrawn, remove it. If it is stuck to another tooth, remove it using this instrument as depicted:.
It resembles a small billhook, made of very sharp Indian iron. You will find it indispensable for many days due to the hardness of the tooth and to prevent disturbing other teeth. If it is one that can be withdrawn then withdraw it with an Indian prong as follows.
It is all made in India, its handle being finely engraved. It should be as fine as the needles with which you make prongs; you cool the tooth a little each day for many days gently so it doesn't disturb the tooth and fall out, then wrap it again and remove some of the scales afterwards.
If a tooth has broken off some of its fragments, it causes damage to the tongue during speech. It is necessary to cool it down until that crack roughness disappears. Whether or not the fragments touch each other, they do not cause injury to the tongue nor do they spoil speech.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In connecting movable teeth with threads of silver or gold.
If the old teeth are exposed, they wobble and move with a blow or fall. The patient cannot even eat anything for fear of them falling out. Treatment with tighteners did not help the condition of the teeth, and the treatment failed.
The trick lies in pulling a thread of gold or silver, with gold being better as silver corrodes and deteriorates after a few days while gold remains intact indefinitely. This does not affect it at all. The thread should be of medium hardness and thickness to suit the space between the teeth.
The diagram for connecting teeth involves taking the thread and inserting it between two correctly positioned natural teeth. Then, weave the ends of the thread between one or more movable teeth until weaving reaches the correct tooth from the other side.
Then, repeat the weaving from where you started and gently pull your hand to ensure that none of the teeth move. The tension should be on the ends of the thread at the roots of the natural teeth so they don't slip away. Cut off the excess thread with scissors and bring together the remaining parts, tie them tightly, and hide them between the correct tooth and the movable one.
So as not to damage the tongue, leave it like this for as long as you can. If it breaks or slips, retighten it with another thread and enjoy it in such a way throughout your life. This is how teeth look and this is their method of attachment in two natural teeth and two movable ones as shown:
And the first or both of them may return to their places after falling there and intertwine as we described, remaining. And it is done by a saddle maker friend, and he carves bones from cow's bones, then makes him into the shape of a saddle tree and places it in the position where the saddle tree had gone. And it is pulled as we said, remaining and enjoying that.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In cutting the band that is presented under the tongue, it prevents speaking.
This band that is presented under the tongue may either be naturally born in humans or be postulated as a result of an injury that has healed.
In this operation, you open the mouth of the patient and place his head on a stone while lifting his tongue. Then, cut that nervous band across where it is displayed until the tongue is released from its constriction. If there are some hardness or complication left in the wound after healing, insert a probe diagonally then cut it across until the band separates and the knot dissolves.
And be careful not to cut into the depth of the flesh and sever a blood vessel there, causing bleeding. Then rinse the surgical site with rose water or with vinegar and cold water. Then place for the night under the tongue a thread made of cotton which the patient holds each night.
So that it does not heal again, if there is blood bleeding, put a powdered zaja on the spot. If your blood overcomes, cool the area with an oculus applicator suitable for this purpose. And then treat him with all other treatments until he recovers.
The thirty-fifth chapter.
In removing the worm that is produced under the tongue.
A lump may occur under the tongue that resembles a small leech, preventing the tongue from performing its natural functions. Perhaps it grows so much as to fill up the mouth even. The treatment involves opening the mouth of the patient facing the sun and looking at the lump.
If you see it as red or black, hard, and devoid of sensation in the patient, do not expose him to it for it is a cancer. If it appears leaning towards whiteness with moisture, dip your finger into water and use a gentle scalpel to make an incision in it, and remove it from every side.
If bleeding prevails over your work, place a powdered bandage on it until the bleeding stops. Then return to your work until you can completely remove it, then rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with all appropriate remedies until it heals.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of tumors in the breasts.
And what grows in the throat from other tumors may present glands within the throat that resemble those that appear outside, and are called breasts. If treated with what was mentioned in the division, if they do not heal.
Examine it, if the lump is hard like that of blood and has little sensation, do not expose it to iron. If it is red in color and its consistency is firm, do not expose it to iron either for fear of bleeding, leave it until it ripens; either it will subside or explode from itself.
And if it is white in color and elongated, with its consistency being soft, this should be cut. The treatment involves looking before you act to see whether it has remained dormant after the heat had been applied or there was a slight decrease in size.
When that happens, position the patient facing the sun's shoe and his head on your rock. Open their mouth and take a servant in front of you; push his tongue down with this instrument which is its likeness.
You make it out of silver or copper, being thin like a knife. When you push it into the tongue and you see the tumor and note its location with your eye, take a thread and insert it into the ducts, pulling it outward without pulling anything off the inner cheek.
Then, you cut it with this instrument similar to scissors but both of its ends are curved. For each end is as if it has the shoe of another one sharp enough; they are made of Indian iron or Syrian steel.
If you cannot prepare this instrument, then cut it with pincers as follows: .
It is sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After cutting one duct, cut the other in the same manner, then after cutting you should flush the patient with cold water or saline water.
If he starts bleeding, flush him with water that has had its peelings or leaves of the date palm or similar substances boiled in it until the bleeding stops. Then treat him until he recovers; and new tumors may appear elsewhere in his throat other than the two ducts, you cut them on the same manner as you would have cut the two ducts.
And a woman was treated for a tumor that had grown inside her throat and reached the windpipe, slightly sensitive; it was about to block her throat, making it difficult for her to breathe. She could not eat or drink due to its obstruction.
And she was on the verge of death if she had stayed for a day or two. The tumor had raised branches until they reached her nostril holes, so I rushed and took a thread to insert it into one of them; then I pulled it out and a suitable piece detached from it.
Then she made the incision where it reached the nasal aperture, then did the same with what protruded from the other nasal perforation. Then she opened her mouth and pinched her tongue, then inserted the needle into the mass, then cut off some of it, leaving only flowing blood behind.
The head of the woman fell off and she started drinking water from that moment onwards, then began eating. We continued cutting that tumor repeatedly for a long period of time. The tumor was replaced instead of what we were cutting, even when it took its toll on her, and this persisted with her.
I altered and reduced the tumor inside my throat operationally, stopping its increase. Then I moved in a direction away from it, not knowing what God did to me after that.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In cutting off a tumor of the thyroid gland.
The one that is called 'Unqa' when it descends into the thyroid and swells, being white and in the shape of a rectangle. It's referred to as 'Column' if it's thick at the bottom and cylindrical. If it's treated with what we've mentioned in this chapter and no effect from the treatment is observed.
I observed the hot tumor that had settled, and it was thin; hence it should be cut. There wasn't any solid accumulation within her, she didn't have a length, and she was of reddish color or black color or without any sensitivity; thus, it is recommended to avoid cutting her.
There is a specific procedure for the ill person; if she appears in her condition as described, with her whiteness and length, it is advisable to place the ill one under the sun's ray, press her tongue with the device that is described beforehand, then insert the needle into the Unqa.
It attracts it downwards and cuts it with one of the two machines that I mentioned in cutting the two nuts, and you should not cut from it except what exceeds natural demand without excess, for if you cut more than this you will harm speech and language.
Then, after the cutting, use what we described in cutting the two nuts and treat her until she recovers. If milk is prevented from being cut, you should use the trick in milking without fear or caution, and the purpose of milking lies with the strong medicine which is to place the head of the sick person on your stone.
Then, use the machine that we mentioned to pinch his tongue. Take the hot water described in the chapter on milking and mix it with an unquenched grindstone powder, making sure it's neither too thick nor too thin. Fill this machine using this mixture; this is how it looks:
It will have a part to put the medicine in which looks like a tablespoon's grinding. Place the machine with the medicine on his tongue itself and make him lie on one side so that saliva from inside his throat doesn't drip down his throat, causing harm.
Then hold your hand with the medicine while pressing it on his tongue for half an hour until you see that it has turned black and the sting of the medicine subsides. If desired, take a cotton thread, twist it at one end, dip the thread in the medicine and then apply it.
The cotton swab dips into a tube from above until it sticks to the tongue. Repeat this several times until you achieve as much as needed for the treatment of the ulcer, then leave it. It will soften and shrink after three or four days, if you need to repeat the medicine, do so.
After the cautery, one must wipe around the navel with a cotton ball soaked in oil and apply the medicine around it. Then rinse with cold water, and treat from outside with pincers and inside with acupuncture sticks until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and further away from fear.
The deity also treats with what is gentler than cautery and cutting. It heals through incense on this condition, various herbs are taken such as thuja, cypress, camphor, nutmeg and ginger, among others from the herbs. They gather all of them or some of them in a pot and immerse it in oil.
Heat the pot and make it boil inside the wisdom's belly. In the center of the lid, there should be a hole that fits the dehydrator on this condition. It is made of silver or brass:.
The tip with the charcoal is inserted into the patient's mouth until steam rises through the tube to the deity, then the deity blesses her indeed. She repeats this treatment several times until she fades. Do not prepare this treatment at the first occurrence of a lump.
If it often increases the lump, then you should perform this when her hot lump subsides. If you don't have this device, take a reed and attach an eggshell to its tip so as not to burn her mouth.
Because the eggshell prevents the hot steam from burning the mouth, this makes for a good treatment with its safety.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In removing splinters and what might irritate the throat.
Often, there are bones or thin splinters in the throat that should be removed. It's necessary to extract what is visible and settles under one's gaze after applying the tongue with a device at noon.
To show you what is in the throat, and what doesn't appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it should be recommended that you vomit out the mucus before its food digests in his stomach. This way, the suspicious matter might come out through vomiting or the mucus may swallow a piece of string or cause choking.
Or swallow a piece of dry bread or take a small piece of the soft sea sponge, tie it in a thread then swallow it. If it reaches the esophagus, quickly pull the string; do this several times.
Very often, the esophagus or bone is stuck there and comes out, but if it does not come out as described otherwise use an apparatus made of lead like this:.
It would be slightly wider than the bone, and at its end there is a scoop that the mucus enters into his throat gently while he raises his head above. The physician should avoid touching his throat to prevent him from coughing, then push the bone or stick out of it, or the doctor may insert it with his hand,.
And inserting the mucus into it is better for him to know the location of the suspicious matter and pushes it down or pulls his hand up with the apparatus as much as he can until it comes out.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the removal of indigestible matter in the throat.
If the mucus was not treated with what we have mentioned from medicine treatment in this section, and if it did not work, then look at the throat of the mucus after he has licked his tongue using the instrument that I described to you.
If you see the mucus, then use a small hook or a soft and tight glove to pull it. If this does not work otherwise take a hollow pipe and insert it into the throat of the mucus near the mucus. Then put a heated metal rod inside the pipe.
This procedure is performed several times and the patient abstains from water for the whole day, then he takes a bowl filled with cold water which he opens his mouth to and rinses with it without swallowing any of it. He moves the water in his mouth from time to time using his hand.
If the block feels the water, it falls onto the seat. If it does not come out as described, then the throat evaporates the urine and the bladder with the apparatus we described in the incense of God. This is done several times, and it falls.
The purpose of the incense is to take a quantity containing fever jasper in fire, the amount covered with a lid in its center there is a hole. Then you assemble one end of the apparatus in that hole. After this, he throws the incense and puts the ill person at one end of the tube and closes his mouth so that the incense does not come out until he knows that the incense has reached his throat.
If the block falls onto the seat, if it does not fall or otherwise the incense is repeated several times and the patient endures thirst and eats salt and garlic and does not drink water; inevitably this procedure will make it come out, and this is a picture of an apparatus that attracts the block from the throat when vision falls upon it.
It resembles the calyxs as you see, but it has this feature of sterilization that enters the throat and its ends resemble a bird's beak in it where if it touches something it doesn't leave: a roughness of the probe.
Another apparatus is used to press the tongue with it; it's a wide iron ring that can accommodate the mouth up to the tip of the tongue, which enters the mouth on its side so that the mouth remains open against the patient's will and he cannot pull it out until she removes it:
Description of the device used to open the mouth at this particular scale.
Chapter Forty.
In this, he makes use of speech in relation to the swelling of glands and cutting into them.
Tumors are of many kinds and types, differing according to what this book goes on to mention one by one. They vary in their swelling and cutting, with two aspects: the first being related to the nature of the tumor itself and what it contains from moisture.
The second type is according to the places where they occur in the body, as a tumor that occurs in the head differs from one that occurs in the chest and one that occurs at an inflamed site compared to one that appears in a joint; each has its own mode of treatment.
Among the tumors, some should not be incised until the pus in them has matured and ripened. Others do need to be incised, specifically because their swelling is not complete as is the case with tumors that are close to joints.
For when a tumor occurs near a joint and takes its course until it infects the surrounding area, it might damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint. This could cause disability for that limb or the tumor could be close to a major organ.
For if you defer the incision until the pus matures, this could harm the main organ or make it near the chest in which case it should be incised deliberately. Only a partial maturation of the tumor is required when it's near the chest so as not to spread infection into the cavity of the chest and become an internal issue.
It becomes in some cases not to be cured, and you should know the time for incising tumors that have fully matured. This is when the pain of the tumor subsides, fever disappears, redness decreases, swelling diminishes, and all other signs disappear.
It is preferable to place the incision at the bottom of the tumor location, if possible, so that the pus can drain more easily downwards or to the lowest part of the tumor and with greater intensity. The incision should be horizontal across the body when tumors are located in the arms or legs.
And the places of muscles, tendons, nerves and arteries as well as in all level locations that do not curve. If it does curve, then the incision should follow the curvature according to the position. And if the tumor is in fatty tissue areas, it would be better to leave the incision alone.
Until its healing is as we said until it's complete, if you make the incision before this stage, there will be a long period of pus discharge and it might be sticky. It could even harden its edges and wound bed. Some tumors may be made at the body's width when necessary or according to what the organ needs.
It is necessary to use a single incision for small tumors and wide or many slits for large ones, depending on the size of the tumor. Some tumors may require skin removal and cutting if they have become like a wound.
It has become to some extent that it dies like what is shown in many ulcers and recesses, from which there are those that split into three angular slits, and from which parts are cut off as with an ace of a card, like the tumor of the armpit.
Some use circular and crescent-shaped cuts like this in certain cases, where there is no prominent head as in flatter tumors that tend to spread, it should be a simple single cut. If the tumor is large and has been present for a long time and if an incision was made before, it's not advisable to let pus come out all at once during that phase.
First remove some of it, then stretch the tumor until another day. Then also drain out some pus. Do this repeatedly and progressively until all is removed.
And especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an elderly person. The vital spirit often disperses with the pus in one go. Perhaps the patient might die and you may not even notice. Be very cautious of this aspect; it's extremely dangerous.
After you finish extracting these tumors, it is necessary to clean the wound and inspect it. If the wound from the tumor is small or there is only one simple incision, use cotton thread or old cotton wool for cleaning. However, if the tumor is large and there are many complex incisions.
It is necessary to insert a wick into each incision, even if the tumor has been cut from the skin or it has eroded. You should then stuff cotton wool or dry cotton thread inside until they touch each other. And you should tighten this for three days.
Then remove it and treat with what is required of ointments until healing occurs. If bleeding appears while you are working, use cold water and vinegar after drinking a cotton thread in them. Apply this on the bleeding area repeatedly.
If bleeding persists, you should use the measures and treatment and ingredients we have described in several places in our book and chapters. However, if you are during winter and the tumor is in a place with many nerves, you should warm up the bandages with a drink of hot water and oil.
You should place them on the area. If you are in summer and if these areas have heat, then carry the bandages with a drink of water and oil or a drink and oil both of which are cold, until it reaches the third day as we said before whereupon you should release the tumor and clean it.
It utilizes what is appropriate until it heals, this is what you need to know about treating tumors in general. As for the details, I have mentioned each tumor and how to approach its treatment step by step.
The forty-first chapter.
In the section concerning tumors that appear on the scalp.
Tumors appear on the scalp, they are small and belong to a type of goods that gall bladders contain. They have conditions similar to a chicken's combs, and there are many types from them such as fatty ones, and others that contain moisture resembling phlegm.
And there are those that contain moisture resembling pus and soup-like substances, among others. There are also stone-like hard ones; all of them pose no danger from cutting or removal as long as you do not encounter a blood vessel when cutting.
The procedure in cutting it is to initially cut into it with the instrument that will appear after this, which is called a scalpel, until you understand what it contains. If it contains moisture, then cut it along its length in an easy incision like this:
And start by cutting from line ~b~ to line ~c~. If the moisture has drained, then remove the sac that contained this moisture and cut it completely, leaving nothing at all. Often if you leave a bit, it will come back again.
Then, soak a cotton ball in the liquid grease if available or else in salt water, fill the wound with it and leave it overnight. It eats away what is left of the sac, then re-soak the wound with the same process again and third time if needed.
Until you are sure that nothing remains from the cyst, then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the tumor contains fatty goods, cut it like this pattern:
Split it in a hard cut, insert the needles at both edges of the wound and extract it from every direction. Try to remove the pus that contains within it; if you encounter a vessel, do as described after this step, and do the same for tumors if they are constricted by the cut.
The same treatment applies as mentioned, cutting through the hardened tumor is easier because it has little blood and moisture. It's possible that some tumors in the head of certain people do not have any moisture at all; this could be due to having cut into a tumor.
Examine an elderly woman's head, I dissected the tumor like a hard old shellfish with creamy white flesh that could not be broken even if one were to throw it; it was not like other tumors that occur in adult heads, which are similar to those found in children's heads.
When dealing with ear canals, cut them all in a simple cut and make the cavity at their lower part so that it facilitates the flow of material downwards. Then treat it according to what suits its treatment.
The second and fortieth chapter.
In the cut on pigs, which often occurs in the neck area, these tumors also frequently appear in the neck and under the elbows, as well as between the breasts. They may also occur in other parts of the body; there might be one that appears in the neck or it could be numerous, some of them giving rise to others.
Each pig of this kind has its own special pus sac, like in goods and head tumors as we described. The types of these pigs are numerous: some are hard, others contain moisture, and there are also poisonous ones that do not respond to treatment.
The thing I observed about it was its good condition upon touch, and its outer appearance is close to the color of skin. It moves in every direction, but it is not attached to the neck nerve, nor to the lymph nodes, nor to a vein, and it is not moist. You should cut it with a simple incision from top to bottom of the body in this way, from line ~A~ to line ~B~.
And peel it from every side, and if needed use a scalpel or two scalpels or many, as we said about head tumors. Remove it gradually, and make the incision not so sharp.
So that you don't cut more than needed or upset the patient, cut only what's necessary. If you cut a nerve or artery and it hinders your work, put some powdered antiseptic or bone fragments in the wound to stop bleeding.
Tighten the wound and leave it until the tumor calms down and the wound relaxes, ready for healing. Bleeding stops then, return to your work until you're done. Then use your probing finger if there's any residue, followed by small maggots which you'll remove and clean.
If there's a large blood vessel in the pig's root, it would be preferable not to cut off that pig from its root. Instead, you should tie it with a thin double thread and leave it until it falls out on its own without causing harm, then stuff the wound with dried cotton that had been soaked in Egyptian massage ointment. Afterward, treat it.
If you cut the pig completely, it's necessary to bring together the edges of the wound and sew it at its edges after ensuring there are no remnants of fat. If I see that there is still some bone fragment from the pig left over.
In order to refer to the cut, its source and origin, you should use stitching as we have mentioned and anything that a pig contains which holds moisture. You can extract it with simple pressing where you see the place of its maturation and make sure the pressing is on what lies below as we said.
Then, after pressing, apply the Egyptian ointment and similar to it to consume any remaining decay. Until you see that the wound has been cleaned; then treat it with herbal medicines for the flesh until it is cleared.
The forty-first chapter.
In the case of a growth in the throat, which occurs within the larynx.
I mentioned this division of the throat with a growth inside it; I have not seen anyone in our region perform this operation, and this is their way of speaking. But those suffering from heartburn should avoid cutting into the throat as they do not benefit from that.
In order that all the bronchi and lung be moist, while if there is a hot growth in the mouth or throat or tonsils where it is not due to congestion then it's necessary to use a cut into the throat for relief from the discomfort caused by suffocation.
If we want to do that, we should cut through the larynx under three or four loops of the tubing, or make small cuts across between two loops as much as the cut is in the epiglottis and not in the cartilage. This position corresponds with the cut.
Because it is without flesh and the blood vessels are far from it, if the surgeon is cowardly, then he should extend the neck skin with a strip then cut through the skin until it reaches near to the tubing where there are blood vessels, and when he sees something.
Then he incises the duct as we described, and uses this to guide the incision through the phlegm that comes out of it with movement and loss, along with cessation of voice. The wound remains open for a while. Then when the time has passed which made him fear choking, he gathers his lips together from the skin.
And he plans the operation alone without removing the cartilage, then they use medications for the growth of tissue until it heals. He, the author of this book, explains this sentence that we have narrated: If they see the pus-filled tumor has blocked his throat, this is what they do according to their description.
And the sick person was on the verge of death, and he tried to ensure his breath by opening the throat for him. They made an incision in the throat so that the sick person could breathe near the wound, thus saving himself from death. They were instructed to keep the wound open until the course of illness completes its cycle, which lasts three days or approximately this duration.
At that point, they ordered to stitch up the wound and treat it until recovery. And what I personally witnessed is that a servant took a knife and sent him to his neck; he cut part of the windpipe with it. He was called for treatment, and when we found her, she was groaning as if she were being slaughtered, so the wound was exposed.
I found that the blood coming out of the wound was minimal, indicating that neither wind nor phlegm had been cut. Air was exiting from the wound and she became better with treatment; until she recovered fully, there was nothing else for the servant except to cough slightly without any more complications.
She returned to her best condition after some days. From this, we can say that opening the throat does not have any danger in it.
The Forty-Fourth Chapter.
In the cut on the tumor that is exposed in the hoop from outside, it is called the hoop tumor.
This tumor, which is called the hoop tumor, is a large body-colored tumor. It is very common in women and it has two types.
Either it is natural or it is incidental. If it's natural, there is nothing to be done about it. But if incidental, it can be divided into two types: one resembling fatty goods and the other resembling a tumor that results from the entanglement of veins; with its cut being dangerous. It should not be treated with iron except for the smaller part of it. If you probe and inspect it with a metal rod, its consistency resembles fatty goods and is not attached to anything from the tissues. So, cut it as you would cut fatty goods. If it's within a sac, remove it along with the contents of the sac. Otherwise, thoroughly extract all parts, then treat the area with what should be done in treatment procedures.
The Fifty-Fourth Chapter.
In the cut on types of fatty goods.
Fatty goods come in many types, and I have mentioned all of them in the sections. It is necessary for us to clarify here the difference between fatty goods and exudate as it is problematic; so I will say that exudate has heat, fever, frightening pains until the flow subsides and becomes more consistent. And then the pus finishes, and at that point, the fever and intensity disappear. The fatty goods do not accompany it with heat or fever or pains; they are contained in a membranous sac which is its specific container. They have the color of the body and start like mustard seeds, becoming like goosebumps and can range from larger to smaller sizes.
This is of two types, either fatty or does it contain moisture, as I mentioned in the division. When you come to treat the commodity, it is necessary that you first probe and examine it with the instrument known as the speculum, which will be illustrated in the following section after this.
Measure the size of the tumor, then take out the speculum and look at what comes out. If a wet secretion comes out, regardless of its color, make a simple incision in it as you have done with other tumors. But if no wet secretion comes out through the speculum, know that it is fatty.
Make a longitudinal incision on it, as I taught you, resembling this image. Hang it with hooks and gently remove the skin from all sides. If possible, keep the bag intact when removing the goods along with it.
If the bag breaks during surgery and you cannot remove it intact, this often occurs. Remove it piece by piece until nothing is left. If any remains, no matter how much or little, the goods may require further action according to the situation.
If you have excess material left, the wound will be difficult to close after your surgery. Use strong sutures and secure the wound from above with something that soothes the hot tumor. Treat it with all other remedies until it heals. If the goods are large, cut them, and treat them in a way that promotes healing.
If you come across a harmful or non-harmful sweat causing bleeding, immediately treat the area with powdered plaster and keep it tightly in place for two to three days until the wound heals and stops bleeding. Then return to cutting what is left of the goods.
The Sixty-Fourth Section.
In the figures of the machines.
Those which operate within its division and opening, there are figures of the forceps, they come in three types; large ones, medium ones, and small ones.
Figure of a large forceps:
Figure of an intermediate forceps:
Figure of a small forceps:
It is made of hardened iron, square at the ends, designed for easy entry into tumors. This figure represents the scalpel and is called 'al-bird', it also comes in three types; large, intermediate, and small. The figure of a large scalpel:
Figure of an intermediate scalpel:.
Figure of a small scalpel:.
It is suitable for examining tumors, surgical wounds, valves, and cavities to inspect what's inside them from bones and such. It is made of ground smooth metal like steel Chinese or Spanish swords or simply iron or silver; among these, the best are those made of Spanish swords.
Swords can also be made from lead, and it is suitable for smoothing valves that have a stopper to guide the flow of fluid. It works well despite this stopper. These also come in three types; one being long, another intermediate, and the last being short.
In accordance to the need of each valve, its thickness is made according to the size and narrowness of the valve. The figure of a large lead sword:
Figure of a middle-sized lead sword:.
Figure of a small lead sword:.
Types of cannulas and they are numerous because there is one that is simple meaning the one with a single flap. This type has three kinds, large ones, medium ones, and small ones. And from them comes blind cannulas which also have three types. From those is the cannulas with flaps having two flaps, this type also has three types. And among them are the reinforced cannulas with flaps, this type also has three types. And there are three types, including the cannulas with three flaps. This type also has three subtypes and each one of these is needed in its own place. A simple large syringe:. A picture of a medium-sized simple syringe: A picture of a small, simple syringe:.
A picture of a large blind syringe:. A picture of an average-sized blind syringe:.
A picture of a small blind syringe:.

A picture of a large syringe with three valves:.
A picture of a medium-sized syringe with three valves:. A picture of a small syringe with three valves:.
And these are the cutters that slit and cut goods and tumors, they are of three types because there are large ones among them, medium-sized ones, and smaller ones. A picture of a large cutter:.
A picture of an intermediate-size scalpel:.
A small operating image:.
Her needles, with which she cuts, have limited lengths and the rest is unlimited. She designed it this way so that when there's fear of cutting a sweat gland or nerve, one can use these needles instead to remove goods (presumably referring to medical procedures). It provides slight relief from the burning sensation one might experience during the removal of a tumor.
And these are the sizes of the traps, and they come in three types; there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large trap:.
It is made of a type of malleable copper that twists, and in each end there is a broad spoon-like utensil. At the top of it, there's an incised scalpel hidden inside, which looks like a bird's tongue. It can be moved inwards and outwards whenever you want, as you see.
Images of the scalpels that are hidden between the fingers when pressing tumors, which patients do not feel. They come in three types; there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel:.
Images of the blood clamps that stop bleeding, they come in three types; there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of the large blood clamp:.
They are made of copper or slightly elongated like a Chinese scroll as you see, and they should be flexible. It's necessary for these types of blood clamps to have large and small sizes so that when needed quickly to stop bleeding, without medicine being available, you can use them efficiently.
However, it is not used for bloodletting in every part of the body, but rather in fatty areas like the thigh and calf muscles, arm muscle, breast, abdomen, and kidneys, as well as other wet fatty organs.
And you can make other small devices resembling the walnut shells as shown in this picture.
It is used to stop bleeding if it occurs at the stump or during the cutting of a vein or artery. It can be made into a grinder as shown in this picture.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
In the fatty tissue of men's breasts.
The one that resembles women's breasts can swell in some people to the extent of resembling women's breasts, remaining warm and hardened. If someone dislikes this, it is recommended to make a cut on the breast like a crescent shape, as shown here.
From line B to line C:. Then, remove all the fat, fill the wound with gauze ointment, sew up the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals. If the breast drops downwards due to its size as it does in women, then it should heal properly.
It is necessary to make two cuts in the upper part of its sides resembling a half-moon shape, each one connected to the other at its ends. This will result in the larger line encompassing the smaller as shown here. From line B to line G, then cut the skin that lies between the two cuts. Remove the fat and use the stitching methods we have mentioned along with pins and other treatments needed until it heals.
If a cut is not large enough, it may be necessary to make another cut for the sake of alleviating concern or due to bleeding. It's advisable to stuff the wound with cotton soaked in ghee until any remaining fat is consumed, then treat it until it heals.
The forty-fourth chapter of the eighth.
In the abdomen, in cases involving tumors that appear below the ribs.
These tumors that appear below the ribs are of a piglike hardness contained in a sack, and among them are those containing fluids. Whatever of them contains fluid should be cut with a semicircular incision like this.
From line ~b~ to line ~g~, once all the fluid from the tumor has been drained for a duration, gauze should be used to cover and leave it until the next day. Then remove the gauze.
And treat with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of a piglike kind, cut it as we described for cutting pigs similarly; if the wound penetrates to produce pus, then use lancing as mentioned previously.
The forty-fifth chapter of the ninth.
In cutting the tumor that appears along with the artery or vein, it is called aneurysm.
If the artery is cut and the skin above it heals, this often leads to a tumor forming. Similarly, veins can also cause ballooning and a tumor formation inside them.
And the signs by which you can tell if the tumor and balloon are due to an artery or a vein; if the tumor is caused by the artery, it will be rectangular when pressed together deeply in the body. If you push on the tumor with your finger, it feels like there's something hard inside.
The one caused by the vein will have the tumor lying flat on the surface of the body. Cutting these tumors is dangerous, especially in areas like below the ribs and under the armpits, neck and many other parts of the body; they are very significant, so it should be avoided to treat them with iron.
Also from them, in the limbs or in the head, what should be avoided is anything that swells at the mouth of a vein; when this occurs, make a cut on the skin longitudinally. Then open the incision by scratches, then strip and remove the vein from clots.
Once it's revealed, insert a needle and extend it to the other side. Tighten the vein with a double thread at two points as you instructed in threading the veins that are in the grooves. Then squeeze out blood from the area between the clamps until all of it is expelled.
When the tumor resolves, apply the treatment that generates pus until you remove the clamps. Then treat it with ointments suitable for this, until it heals.
If the tumor is from a cut in a vein, it's necessary to hold as much of the tumor with your hand along with the skin as possible. Then insert a needle below where you held it with your hand and thread it, having it double-ended, until you pull it out from the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly as instructed for tying a bunch of grapes with both ends of the thread, if you fear it might unravel. If this is so, insert another needle with another thread under the entire tumor at the crossing point of the first needle.
Pull your threads in four places, then cut the tumor down its middle until you can remove all of it. Remove any excess skin and leave what was attached previously. Then place on top a dressing that has been soaked in wine and oil. Then use the treatment involving leeches and ointments until it heals.
The fiftieth chapter.
In the tumor that shows from the curvature of the nerve.
The tumor also appears in the vein and artery, similarly, it shows up in nerves when there is a blow or extreme fatigue occurs or something similar. It tends to be more frequent in places of nerves passing through the bones and joints.
In every location where joints move, it is a mobile tumor that resembles the color of the rest of the body. It's usually without pain. If you press hard on it, one feels a sensation similar to numbness in the affected area. The tumor doesn't tend to be deep within the body.
But it is under the skin and moves in all directions, not going forward or backward. Wherever it's near joints, there shouldn't be exposure to iron as it might cause damage. It doesn't apply to those parts of the head or forehead.
Cut the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, hold it with pincers and cut it off from its source. If it's large, attach it to a clamp and remove it, then remove it and stitch up the wound until it heals completely.
The fifty-first chapter.
In removing hernias that appear in the abdomen.
Many people have experienced hernias in their abdomens and other parts of their bodies. These are called fungoidal hernias due to their resemblance to mushrooms. Their base is delicate, while the top part is thickened. They can vary from being small to significantly large.
I have seen a man with two hernias in his belly that resembled things like mushrooms. They had a slightly different color, but they were very delicate at the base and thickened at the top. Both of them cracked apart. Moisture was constantly dripping from them. I removed both; one weighed about twelve ounces and the other around six ounces.
When it comes to cutting them, you should look and see if the pus is wet. If the pus color is white, moist, with a delicate origin, cut it with a broad scalpel. And let your blade be in contact with fire frequently; often, much blood tends to flow upon cutting.
If the blood predominates, seal it. If you see the pus as hard and afraid of cutting with iron, take a tight copper thread and pull on the pus which is its characteristic; leave it for two days then increase in pulling the copper; the copper will keep pulling.
Every time it penetrates the pus until it breaks and falls from itself without effort, if the pus has a thick origin then in cutting some fear and grease occur especially those inside but it is possible to cut half of it or part of it.
Then seal it so that it doesn't recur, then treat it until the wound heals. Be cautious not to expose yourself to pus that looks like a thin color with little sensibility and appears smooth; this could be cancerous. We will provide information about cancer after this.
The second and fiftieth chapter.
In treating scrotal hernias.
Scrotal hernias are caused by many factors, either from the splitting of the abdominal duct that produces pus or food, as happens in various cases, or from bleeding that emerges from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or it can be due to wind that gets trapped there.
If it is due to the splitting of the abdominal duct and the emergence of pus, then the color of the tumor resembles that of the body and it is soft without pain and its presentation appears different. And if it was due to the discharge before, its condition differs greatly from what we described. If you pinch it with your fingers, it disappears then comes back again and maybe there's a granulation and much thickening happens upon going to the toilet or severe fatigue. And if it was due to moisture beforehand, it becomes wet.
And if it doesn't disappear when pinched, neither does it increase or decrease, and if it was due to blood then this symptom shows the tumor to be black. If it was due to new tissue growth, the tumor is firm and hard, staying in one place.
And if it was due to wind, touching it would be wet. In dealing with this situation, you should observe: If the rash resulted from blood of the artery or vein or wind, one should refrain from treating it as there is both fear and temptation involved, as I taught you in the section about tumors that occur because of arteries and veins.
And if the rash resulted from discharge or pus, you should instruct the patient to restrain himself and stand upright, then apply a stick around the entire rash area. Then, tell him to lie between your hands on his back. Use a wide scalpel around the rash at the spot you showed with the stick, then extend across the middle of the tumor with a large needle and thread. Tie the scalping area tightly with strong thread or silk.
The knot of the bandage should be loose. Then, open the tightly constricted middle of the tumor above the bandage. Insert your index finger inside and seek the discharge. If you find it has been absorbed by the bandage, loosen the knots and push the discharge back into the body. If pus is found, extend it with a needle.
Cut off its tip, if it obstructs a vessel or artery tie it firmly and proceed with your work. Take two needles and insert two strong threads into them. Enter the threads in the loop you made around the tumor, having previously inserted it. Then pull the tumor in four places with the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the position until the tightened flesh decays on itself or falls off when it becomes rotten, then treat it with what is necessary from ointments until it heals. If pus was coming out of the opening in a fresh piece of meat there.
Or if there is moisture, it should be advised to cut the tumor as we said and remove the blood or moisture you find in it. Then treat it with what will heal the wound.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
In treating cancer.
We have mentioned in the section the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines, warning against treating it with iron because it might result in bleeding. We also mentioned the cancer originating from the womb and warned about its treatment.
We mentioned that when cancer is in a place that can be completely removed, like breast or thigh tumors, and such organs are capable of being extracted as a whole, especially if it's small at the beginning. However, if it presents itself as a large mass, it should not be approached.
If I have not been able to cure anyone from it before me, and I haven't seen any who reached this stage previously, the action when it is possible as we said, should be that you proceed gradually making the matter easier step by step then deepen it if there's a clear filling in the veins.
Then the operation is performed on the patient, enabling him to work. Then, tubes suitable for him are inserted into the cancer, and they are excised from all sides with the skin until nothing remains of its roots, leaving the blood to flow without hastily cutting it off.
Then press the places and drain all the thick blood by hand or with whatever you can manage with machines. If your work is obstructed by a great gush of blood from cutting an artery or vein, make the skin cool until the bleeding stops, then treat it with every other treatment until it heals.
The forty-fifth chapter.
In the treatment of scabies.
We have informed you about different methods of cure, how water combines and the signs of each type along with their treatment using medicines. Only one type, which is the 'zakki' (clean) type, can be treated with iron; not the 'tibi' (diseased), nor the 'dhab' (fleshy) type at all.
If this method of treating scabies, the 'zakki' type, with medicines does not work and your treatment has failed, check whether there might have been overexertion causing weakness or if another disease exists besides scabies.
If there are symptoms like coughing, diarrhea or similar issues and iron is needed for treatment, ensure that the patient has sufficient strength without any other disease besides scabies, and isn't a child or an elderly person. In such cases, you should have the patient stand between your hands to perform the operation. Then, behind the patient, a servant presses his belly with their hands and pushes the water downwards towards the elbow area. Then, take up a saddle-shaped tool in this manner:.
Limiting the incision to two sides, determining the end as in the amputation, except that there is a little fat left for it not to become offensive during work on internal organs and then might cause injury. If the fetus was born from the intestinal side.
You should extend the cut from her navel three fingers down to above her ankles, if the fetus was born due to a liver disease, then your cut on her belly should be up to three fingers in length. If it was born due to gallbladder illness, then your cut should be on the right side up to three fingers.
Also, the cut should not be on the side that the patient wants to lie on, as it might leak bodily fluids into this vulnerable area. Then poke through all of the skin with your instrument and then insert your instrument in this cut and raise your hand.
In the amputation between skin and muscle as if you are removing hair, the amount you remove should be the size of a fingernail or slightly larger. Then pierce the muscle until it reaches an empty space which is where the water resides, then extract it and enter your tool into this hole, which is how it appears in this image.
She is almost like a short tube with a thin hollow passage, made of silver or brass or polished steel. At its bottom, there's a small hole and on its sides, two holes from each side and one from another side as you see.
And it might place its tip in the form of a quill pen, like this illustration shows:.
At its top, it has a loop. If the device reaches the water, then it lowers from its holder onto the device, draining the water in an average amount of time. For if you drain more than what is necessary in this time period, perhaps the patient might die due to animal soul dissipation.
If he is in a state close to death, but you induce him to urinate according to his strength and the indications of his condition like the intensity of his pulse and the beauty of his color. Then remove the tool and hold back water since he will conserve it.
Because of the skin that holds the hole in the chest which I informed you to cool on this condition, then renew the tool another day if I see the patient capable of doing so.
And also remove the minimal amount of water, do this for days while you are monitoring it to avoid mistakes, so that no water is left except a small amount. If you were worried about the patient and left some water in excess, bury this excess in hot sand.
A large amount of perspiration in the steam room and under the sun, make him endure thirst and treat him with dried medicines until he recovers. Care for his stomach, liver, and gallbladder after removing water as described previously.
The fifty-fifth chapter.
In treating children born with their urinary openings not in the correct place, or when the opening is narrow or not in its proper location.
Someday, some boys will be born with their urinary openings not in the correct place. It is necessary to act quickly and make a hole for them at the time of birth.
A very fine castrator like this one:.
Then place a very fine, thin lead pin in the opening and secure it. Hold for three or four days, so that when the urine wants to go off then push it back. If you lose the lead, perhaps the urine which has wandered from its place will not leave it and become blocked.
If the hole is narrow, it is treated with lead as we have said, for many days until it widens. And there are some where the hole is not in its place; that is, some are born and the hole is at the end of the bladder so they cannot urinate forwards.
Until he raises the penis with his hand above, not being born before that when menstruation cannot reach the womb on a straight path and it is a very nasty reason. The purpose in this matter is to lie the pregnant woman on her back.
Then extend it with your left hand strongly and cleanse the head of the penis using a file or a sharp, large pencil-like tool as if you were carving something that would be at its center resembling a bladder. The hole should occur in the middle where it is supposed to.
And you should take care during your work not to cause excessive bleeding, as it often leads to dealing with what cuts the blood and heals the wound until it is clean.
The sixty-fifth chapter.
In the urine that appears in the bag, bladder, kidney stones, decay, and adhesion of the bag to the bladder.
This urine often appears in the penis, which is a fleshy tissue of the prostate gland, and it can be foul or not. The non-foul one should be attached to a gentle thread.
Cut it until you clean all of it, then carry on with a cotton swab that has been soaked in Egyptian spermicide. Afterwards, treat it with camel's urine to heal. If the urine is foul and pinkish, after cutting and removing the skin, you should use the kyi (a kind of herb) for treatment.
If the urine is in a greasy bag and it has not been purified, with some of the urine inside the bag and some outside, then it should be advisable to remove the urine that's inside first until it disappears. Afterward, then deal with the urine from the outside.
Because if you treated them together, the bag might burst. It could also occur in women and in the bag, there may be blackening and decay; it should be advisable to remove everything that has darkened or is likely to spoil or has already spoiled.
Then, apply it afterwards with honey and the peels of processed pomegranate and cinnamon. Then treat him with all other remedies until he recovers. If there is bleeding, use this method with a Halali's tool on this pattern:.
If bleeding or a wound has become infected, the tool is useful for both conditions. If the swelling of the gland gathers and disappears at some point, it should be necessary to insert a lead pipe into the path of the sperm in order to cleanse it from there. As for the adhesion of the bag to the gland.
This adhesion occurs in those whose bag is healthy and did not undergo circumcision, it may happen that its adhesion precedes a wound or tumor. It should be advisable to remove it with an excision tool until the band dissolves and the gland clears from all sides.
If it's difficult to distinguish them during examination, it should be advisable to remove a bit from the gland and the bag. The reason is that the bag is thin and might burst quickly due to its delicacy, then separate between the bag and the gland with a thin cotton thread that has been dipped in cold water to avoid also getting stuck.
Then he treats with a gripping drink until it heals.
The fifty-second chapter.
In cleansing boys and treating what they might do wrong.
Castration is not something other than the separation of connection like all surgeries, but as it was done by our will and used specifically on boys, we should perform the best work in this matter.
And the easiest way leading to safety, I say that the earlier sources did not mention castration in any of their writings because it was not used in their laws and rather, it is what we have acquired.
Through experimentation, and I found among the craftsmen and barbers that they use Mosaics and scissors for purification, they use the tourniquet and binding with thread, and cutting with nails. I have tried all these methods.
And I found none better than purification by scissors and binding with thread, because purifying with Moses is often accompanied by skin retraction as the scaly skin has two layers, maybe cutting off the upper layer of skin while leaving the bottom layer.
It often requires another cut and renewed pain with purification by forceps because it doesn't necessarily cut the foreskin's tip as it might enter into its hole. And, when it comes to purification by nails, there may be skin tear or wound in your work, or perhaps the boy's skin was naturally short.
Very often they are born already cleansed and don't need purification, as I have seen this. And when it comes to purification by scissors and binding with thread, experimentation revealed its superiority because the top blade is like the bottom blade for cutting purposes.
When your hand has worked on par with both bones cut to a single measure and within the same period of time, then the thread's control becomes almost like a wall for the testicle skin from every side. There would not be any mistake in sewing it, and the first purpose is to trick the boy.
And especially if he is one who understands a little that you are only tying the thread in his testicle and letting him go back to another day, then make him happy and pleased with every way possible which you can from him, and what his mind accepts. Then, stop him before you, standing tall.
And don't have him sitting, hiding the scissors in your palm or under your foot; there shouldn't be anything that catches his eye or any of the machines. Then put your hand into his testicle and inflate the skin until the head of the testicle comes out.
Then clean what accumulates there of filth, then tie the instructed position with a double thread, then tie a little below it with a second knot. Then hold with your thumb and pinch well the lower tying point, cut between the knots. Then lift the skin upwards quickly and remove the head of the testicle, then let the blood flow for a little; it is better and causes less swelling of the testicles. Then wipe him with a wet swab. And dust him with the ashes of burnt tobacco or corn flour, both are excellent.
Then lift the skin upwards quickly and remove the head of the testicle, then let the blood flow for a little; it is better and causes less swelling of the testicles. Then wipe him with a wet swab. And dust him with the ashes of burnt tobacco or corn flour, both are excellent. Then apply on the stitches from above with a swab of an egg yolk cooked in rose water and rubbed with fragrant sweet rose oil, then leave it for another day. Then treat him with other medications until he recovers.
This is a picture of the scalpel that is suitable for purification:.
The file should be sharp, without any bend or flaw. The thickness of the cutting edge must be equal to that of the handle and both are of same length. As for the error during purification, it might involve turning over the whole inner skin or some parts of it while cutting; you should repair it with your dagger before the area inflates.
Cut it evenly, if you cannot hold it with your dagger, use a scraper and cut it. If three days have passed and what remains under the scalp is inflamed, discard it until the hot lump subsides, then gently scrape it off.
Cut it according to what you can handle, and preserve from the scalp. If you cut a part of the scalp, it doesn't harm that. Treat it with what seals wounds as we described in our article on substances used for sealing wounds.
And if you cut more skin than necessary and it tightens above, that doesn't cause harm either. It's sufficient to treat it as we've mentioned until it heals.
The fiftieth chapter of the eighth section.
In treating urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to blockage by stones, coagulated blood, mucus, fatty tissue, and similar things. After treating this as we have mentioned, apply the various treatment methods described in the section.
If the urine does not start to flow and I have observed that urine retention due to a stone has affected the bladder's neck, it should be made to lie on his elbows. Then one person rides on top of him while supporting his abdomen with their hands and the evacuee should hold onto himself as much as possible.
When then, the neck of the bladder is forced to push out the stone behind, urine will be launched. If it does not launch as we mentioned and if matters get worse for the patient, one might consider using a machine called catheters, which is depicted thus:
It is made of silver, being thin and smooth with a hollow structure like a bird's feather tube. It is about as long as a meter and a half, having a gentle bulge at its tip, and it has an absorbent lure that allows you to take a folded thread and tightly tie a piece of wool or cotton to its end.
One inserts the thread's tip into the end of the catheter and secures it with a small piece of wool if desired, so that it enters the tube to block it like a plug. Then grease the catheter with oil or butter or egg white, and then have the patient sit on a chair.
It then pushes its double-ended rod with wet swabs or oil and moist water, then gently introduces the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the beginning of the urethra. Then it bends the urethra upwards towards the genital area, then pushes the catheter inside.
Even if the urethra is bent, then push the catheters inside until they are close to the prostate, causing the male to bend slightly downwards and have the catheters inside him. Then push it further until it reaches the bladder, the patient realizes that he has reached something empty.
It is made in this way because the urinary tract has a bend in it. Then, pull the thread with a slight force through the wool, as urine follows the thread. Then remove it and drain the urine. And repeat the catheterization process.
Even until the bladder is emptied and urine is found to be light.
The fiftieth chapter.
How to inject the bladder with the reed.
Illustrations of the machines suitable for this, made from silver or from porous brass, have a long tube at the tip. You can drain water and medicines through it using an apparatus known as 'the reed'. Here is how it looks:
They are made from silver or porous brass, all except the tip which is hollowed out. It has a long tube bent into an angle of about one millicentimeter, with two holes on one side and one hole on the other as you can see.
The hollow part where the suction is located is made to fill up as much as it can without excess, so that when anything of moisture is sucked in by it, it gets sucked. And when pushed forward, it pushes back at a distance similar to how a lamp-oil spreader throws oil in naval battles.
And if you want to introduce moisture into the bladder, you insert one end of the reed into the moisture and pull with the suction to lift it upwards. The moisture gets sucked in by the hollow part of the reed and then enters the bladder according to what we described in catheters. After that, you push the moisture using the reed.
And that moisture reaches the bladder in place until it is felt by the urine, this is also a picture of a gentle urinating tool that can be used to urinate into the bladder:.
They are made from silver or ivory, its head is similar to a small plug and it has a cup below where the band is located. Then you take a camel's bladder and put in there the moisture you want to inject into the bladder. You tie it tightly with two strands of thread between the parts with a tight knot.
That moisture is slightly heated over the fire, then the tip of the syringe is inserted into the bladder. Then you grip the moisture on the bladder firmly and tightly until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a thin piece of leather and make a circle from it. Punch holes through all its parts and then insert a fine thread in those holes as if turning them. Then gather the circle like gathering a bag after putting in what you want of moisture, herbs, and water.
Then tie it to the apparatus, and make it like you did with the bladder by squeezing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter sixty.
In the removal of stones.
We mentioned in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, we distinguished between the stone produced in the kidney and the one produced in the bladder, mentioning all its signs. We also mentioned the stone where manual operation and the cut are performed.
This is the stone produced particularly in the bladder, which occurs in the bladder tube, and I describe this with a clear explanation and simplification.
I say that the stone produced in the bladder is more likely to affect boys. One of its signs is that urine comes out of the bladder resembling water in its thinness.
Sand is often seen in it, and his manhood becomes troubled by it, misbehaves with it, and frequently hangs down, then spreads out, causing the pubis to protrude in many of them. It facilitates boys' exposure to this until they reach fourteen years old; it becomes more difficult for the elderly, while young men are somewhere between these two.
The one whose stone is larger has an easier cure, and smaller ones are against this. When it comes to treatment, it should be the first thing that a catheterization is performed on the patient's urine, so that all impurities within it can come out; because he may prevent the existence of the stone upon inspection.
Then, his legs are taken and shaken downwards to push the stone into the urinary bladder or it's transferred from a higher place several times. Then he is seated between your hands with his arms under his knees so that all of the urinary bladder leans downward. Then you examine him.
And push him out of your hands, if you feel the stone in the space, act promptly with making a cut on it from your watch. If it doesn't fall under light touch definitely, then you should rub the thumb (if the patient is male) or middle finger (if the urine is female) with oil from your left hand.
If it's a full boy, introduce it into his stirrup and search for the stone until it falls under your finger. Move it little by little to the neck of the urinary bladder then pinch it with your finger and push it out towards the place you want to make a cut.
And command a servant to squeeze the urinary bladder with his hand, and command another servant to lift up women's hands with their right hand above and with their other hand spread the skin underneath the women towards the place where it should be cut. Then take this form of the cutting tool:.
And cut between the stirrup and the woman's side not in the middle but towards the left ligament. The cut should be at the place of the stone and your finger is in the stirrup while you press it out with a scoop, so that the cut is wide from outside and narrow from inside to the extent needed for removing the stone.
Do not press the finger in the kidney stone's seat crack, perhaps it might come out without difficulty. Know that there may be some of the stone having corners and letters which makes its removal difficult for this reason.
And there are those that are smooth, resembling elms, and inclined which makes their removal easier. When they have corners or letters, they slightly enlarge the crack; if they do not come out this way, it is necessary to adapt to them either by gripping with a tight pair of pliers where its end is like the tongs.
To stabilize on the stone so it doesn't slip away from him, or else to insert a slightly sharp and polished device under it; if you can't do it this way then slightly widen the crack. If you have accumulated some blood then cut it with forceps.
If there are more than one, first push the larger one into the bladder's mouth then cut it open and afterwards push the smaller one; you do this as well if there are more than two. If it is extremely large, then it would be folly to make a large cut on it because that exposes two possibilities: either the instrument might break or the patient could suffer from urine leak.
Either he dies or else, it causes continuous urine burning because the place simply doesn't heal properly. Try pushing until she comes out or change her in a break using forceps to cut and remove her piece by piece.
Once you are done with your work, clean the wound with a basin and patience, bandages and tightness, then place a puncture over it oiled or drink mixed with water or ointment. He should lie on his side not allowing heat to remain in the swelling. The nurse should not change the bandage until the third day.
If the wound heals, bathe the area with plenty of water and oil then treat it with the nuxia balm and the basilic balms until it is clean. If there appears in the wound a hot mass that swells and festers, like clotting blood freezing in the bladder preventing urination, this can be recognized by the bleeding coming out with urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood. If it remains, it calls for decay of the bladder and its infection. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type according to what suits it until it heals.
It is necessary during all stages of treatment to bind the thighs together and unite them, so that the drugs placed on the wound are firmly fixed. If the stone is small and has become in the passage of the penis, causing inflammation there, preventing urine from being expelled; treat it with what I have described before it turns into a rupture.
Often, I have been able to use this treatment instead of a cut. I have tried it and found that you should take a steel scrap which looks like this:.
Triangle-shaped with a sharp point, made of cane. Then take a thread and tie it around the penis under the stone so that it doesn't return to the bladder. Then insert the nail of the steel scrap gently until the steel scrap reaches the same stone.
Gently move the steel scrap in the same stone little by little as you are trying to bore it until you can puncture from the other side. The urine starts flowing out of its place. Then, put your hand on what is left of the stone outside the penis; it breaks and comes out with urine making the cure complete.
If this treatment does not suit you and there is an obstacle preventing you, tie a thread under the stone and another above it. Then cut into the stone in the same penis between the threads, then remove it.
Then the ligature is removed and the clotted blood in the wound is cleansed. It was necessary to tie the thread under the stone so that it would not return to the bladder, while the other tie above, because after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place to cover the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the thread above, you should lift the skin up so that it returns when empty and covers the wound as we said.
The sixty-first chapter.
In the removal of stones for women.
Very little gallstones are born in women, but if a case of one has a stone, it complicates her treatment and raises many reasons. One being that the woman might be young, and the second being that you don't find a woman willing to expose herself to the doctor.
If she is menstruating or from those who are under restrictions, the third being that you don't find a woman skilled in this craft and especially not one willing to be operated on by hand. The fourth reason being that the location of the cut on the stone in women differs from its actual position, requiring an additional incision.
In this regard, there's a risk. If necessity calls for it, you should opt for a skilled female physician; very few are available, so if unavailable, seek a young unmarried companion or find an experienced capable woman in matters of women's health, or bring someone with some knowledge in this field.
You should prepare her and instruct her to do all as she is commanded, starting with inspecting the gallstone thoroughly; this involves checking if the woman is young, and it may be necessary for her to enter her place (uterus) and examine the stone. If found, press it under her finger.
When the time comes to cut her, if she is not yet in labor and has hard stones, the midwife is commanded to insert her finger into the womb of the pregnant woman after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it vigorously, then searching for the stone.
If she finds it, it is necessary to guide her inside the mouth of the bladder down as far as its strength permits until she reaches the root of the thigh. Then, cut her along the lower half of the vagina at the root of the thigh on whichever side she arrives there and feels the stone in that area.
And her finger doesn't remove the stone while pressing it down, and let the cut be small at first. Then insert the tool into this small cut; if she feels the stone, she increases the cut according to what she realizes that the stone will come out from there. And know that there are many types of stones.
Of them, there are small and large ones, smooth and with roughness, long and curved, and branching. Recognize their types so you can use this knowledge as you wish. If your blood flow is dominant, rinse the treated area with the powdered anticoagulant substance and hold it for a while until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone comes out. Remember to prepare with yourself the tools mentioned for removing stones from men that you can use in your work when your bleeding is dominant and you have learned about the heartbeat that it has stopped; then place the weights on the area.
And pull it with the gauze firmly, leave it and do not repeat it, and leave the stone without removing it; maybe she could die. Then treat the wound, wait for the bleeding to stop after days, cleanse the area, return to your work until the stone comes out.
Chapter Two and Sixty
In the cut on the water ducts.
The water ducts are nothing but the gathering of moisture in the white duct under the skin surrounding the testicle, which is called the scrotum. It may be located in a special membrane prepared by nature near one side of the egg.
Until he thinks it's another egg, and there is one between the skin of the testicle and the white duct we talked about. It will only happen very rarely. These water ducts are produced from a weakness that affects females, causing this substance to be formed and exposing them to hits by females.
This moisture comes in various colors, either yellowish, or red blood-like, or dark brown, or white watery, and it is the most common, with distinctive signs.
Wherever the water gathers, if it is in the white duct as we mentioned, the lump will be somewhat elongated to some extent along its length like an egg shape, and there won't be any testis visible since the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If the moisture is in its special membrane, then the lump will be elongated towards one side of the egg.
This is why humans assume it's another egg. If the moisture is between the skin of the testicle and the white duct, it can be felt through touch. And if you want to know the color of the moisture, rub the lump with a square stick that I've shown you before. Whatever comes out from under the pressure of the stick will determine its content.
If we're considering iron treatment, you should order the patient to fast if that's feasible and when his body fills up. Then he lies on his back on something slightly elevated, and place a large number of holes under him. Sit on his left side.
The servant is commanded to sit on his right side, extending his hand towards one of my sides, the skin of the scrotum, and then towards the abdominal cavity. Then a broad blade is taken, and the skin of the scrotum is cut lengthwise from the middle almost to the thigh.
The cut should be straight and parallel to the line that divides the scrotal skin into two halves until it reaches the white sac containing the testicles. You should remove this, being careful not to slice through it, and your incision should be closer on the side that sticks to the testicle; you should also aim for as much accuracy as possible in your incision.
Then, you should widen the filled with water pouch extensively and completely remove all of the water. Next, gently separate the edges of the cut with scissors and stretch out the sac without touching the skin containing the testicles. Cut the tube as much as possible, either in one piece or in sections.
And especially the softer side of it, if you don't remove a piece, water might come out again. If your work causes the testicle to go outside its skin while you're working, and when you finish cutting the tube, fold them back then sew together the edges of the scrotal skin using stitches.
Then treat it with the general treatment of wounds until it heals. If the testicle has been damaged due to another illness, it may be necessary to tie the vessels in the orifice to prevent bleeding, then cut out the scrotum from the orifice and remove the testicle. Then treat it as mentioned.
If the water is present in both sides, know that it's two tubes. Cut the other side in the same way as you did with the first one, whether or not it was convenient for them to be a single work. Then wipe away the blood afterwards.
The insertion involves a piece of wool that has been soaked in oil or rose butter, becoming an outer layer. Another piece of wool that has been soaked in wine and oil is placed on the testicles and abdominal fluids. It places a folded perforation over it; these are the supports. And she ties it from above with the band that has six ends as shown in this picture:.
Then she takes two perforations, ties them with the wool that is spread out on this example and makes the ends which are made of cotton or wet wool. She pulls it tight in the belt of the trousers and one end grabs onto the chair towards the back.
The second takes towards the elbow, and the two ends on the thighs from below, while the remaining two ends are on the buttocks. She pulls all of the tension in the trousers belt. This type of stitch can also be made using a needle instead of cutting with iron.
It involves taking a soft scalpel to cut the scrotal skin as described, until the white membrane containing water is revealed. Then take another iron scalpel as shown in this image:.
She resembles the Greek eye, then she presses that membrane with it until all moisture comes out. Then she stretches the membrane over the metal rods and cuts through it with a scalpel to remove as much of the containing layer as possible until you can extract all of them and avoid touching the egg which should not be exposed to fire.
And know that this method is more purified and avoids bleeding of blood, and it's better than cutting. If there is an obstacle in the cut or during sewing, a hot burn or blood leakage or anything else occurs, you should treat according to what we have mentioned for each case whenever any obstruction comes your way.
If the patient is tough and can't endure this operation due to his suffering, he should perform cautery on what I describe for him, which is whenever it becomes suitable according to your previous indications.
The bladders are watery, it should be advised for the patient to sit on a high stool then apply the cautery beneath the tumor at its lower side using a broad implement. Make sure the cautery runs along the whole body and ensure that there's enough opening so all water can flow out completely. Then place cotton on the spot and tie it.
And let him remove the rest of the water, then treat until he heals. If water continues to leak out while you're performing cautery on him, this is due to the fact that the white membrane obstructs at the mouth of the wound and prevents water from leaking out.
In that case, you should insert a porcupine hair or the instrument used to extract water from loved ones which has been depicted in illustrations, or slightly increase the opening of the wound.
And know that water might reappear and gather after about six months or thereabouts. If it does, apply the cautery in the same way and the patient's suffering will alleviate.
The Sixty-Third Chapter.
In the incision of fatty tumors and their treatment.
And know that an incision on this type of fatty tumor often leads to danger and death, which is why it's best to avoid it and maintain safety while considering the work involved and types of tumors.
I say that many tumors can occur within the bodies made up of female components, and this is due to numerous reasons. Either from excess menstrual flow directed towards females or from a blow, and the color of the tumor matches the body's color with no water presence.
The tumor is hard and perhaps the tumor has a change in color like wood, lacking sensation. It might be due to the complexity of the arteries and their swelling as previously mentioned or from the swelling of the veins. In cases of swelling of the arteries, this can be identified by noticing the disappearance of the tumor.
If it is hard when you pinch it and does not show any transparency, whereas the one due to swelling of veins will not disappear at all upon pinching with your fingers. This type might be perforated or on other tissues.
You are to cut through the scrotal skin, then pull the testicle upwards and take it out of the white canal. You should remove any vessels attached to this vessel and tie them. After removing all parts related to the testicle from both sides, if the testicle is stuck with that living tissue.
It may be necessary to remove the testicle and cut it, if there is attachment between something of the canals or among the vessels. In this case, it should be advisable to remove all that bond completely and cut it in a straight line.
If the tissue growth is in a connecting position that occurs behind, it should be necessary to cut all of it and remove the testicle as we have mentioned. After you finish your work, moisten cotton with butter oil and wine to suture the wound, then heal it with other treatments until it heals.
The forty-sixth chapter.
In treating the stones in the ducts.
The dalya is a tumor that slightly twists like a knot, with relaxation of the tendons and difficulty in movement, sports, and walking. In treating this condition among the diseases, it is similar to what was previously mentioned.
But we should remember to do it as the first did, I say that it is necessary to seat the patient on a high chair, then push the female stirrup down. Then grab the foreskin skin with your fingers and the veins which are close to the penis.
And the servant you have holds it, stretching it tightly. Then, he cuts with a sharp wide scalpel a groove deeply until the veins are exposed. He then cuts from each side as previously shown to you when slit the arteries in the scrotum. Afterwards, he sews it with a needle which has a doubled thread.
And it is fastened at the first place that was offered to it by the duct, and also at the last. Then she cuts it in the middle a groove standing along the length of the body, and removes what has gathered there of excrementous liquids that are bad.
Then treat the rectum with the treatment of all surgeries you wish to produce for a period, so that the veins feeding one female's uterus may fall. There is nothing wrong with that. If offered the duct to all the veins, it should be that one of the females comes out with the veins in order not to deprive the ovary of its food. By cutting off the veins, it deflates and is not beneficial.
The Fifty-sixth Chapter.
In the treatment of intestinal colic.
The occurrence of this colic is from cutting that exposes in the extended peritoneal cavity towards the ovaries from the abdominal cavities; so the intestine tends from this hernia to one of the females.
This hernia can either be from the abdominal incision or from its extension. Both of these types are caused by many reasons, such as a blow, a fall, a cry, lifting something heavy, and so forth. Its sign is that if it's from the extended peritoneum, it tends to occur gradually over a long period of time.
There is no sudden change; the tumor becomes level to about half the depth before the stricture presses the feces, and its indication is that it causes intense pain when pressing at the beginning of the stricture. The tumor appears different under the skin near the surface.
And this occurs by the passage of feces and its exit outside through the stricture, and it may come out with fecal matter; this type is called fecal and calculous. It may also be accompanied by wind. The bile may pass in the feces and get blocked there causing obstruction leading to liver failure.
Because it causes severe pain and gurgling sounds, especially when pressing the stricture; treatment for these types of condition is to use iron which could be dangerous. One should warn against this kind of treatment. The method involves commanding the patient to push feces back inside his body if it tries to return.
Then, he lies on his arms between your hands and raises his legs. Extend the skin next to the artery up high, cut all of the foreskin lengthwise, then pierce in both sides of the cut with incisions according to what is needed for it to open that way.
The cut should be as long as it can allow the testicle to pass through. Then, you would remove the mucous membrane underneath the foreskin until the white and firm scrotal sac is exposed from both sides. At that point, insert your ring finger into what lies below the testicle.
Between the white scrotal sac underneath the testicle skin and the second scrotum, you release any adhesion behind the testicle. Then, with your right hand, fold it into the testicle's skin while simultaneously lifting the white scrotal sac upwards with your left hand. You raise the testicle along with the scrotum towards the cut.
The servant is commanded to hold the egg up and release the adhesive behind completely, and to search with his finger so that there's nothing of the contained mucus in the hard white cavity. If he touches anything from it, push it down into the belly.
Then, you take a needle with thick thread that has been split into ten threads and insert it at the end of the duct beneath the scrotal skin following the incision. Then, cut both ends of the folded thread so that there are four threads left. Then, she lays them on top of each other to form a hard bundle and ties the duct that we said is beneath the scrotal skin tightly from both sides. Then she also wraps the ends of the threads around it and ties them tightly so nothing can reach any of the blood vessels that supply it. So that no inflammation occurs, a hot lump does not arise and there is also a second band outside the first one less than an inch away. After these two bands, she leaves some of the duct beneath the scrotal skin as long as the length of an adult's finger.
So that no inflammation occurs, a hot lump does not arise and there is also a second band outside the first one less than an inch away. After these two bands, she leaves some of the duct beneath the scrotal skin as long as the length of an adult's finger. And cut the rest of it all around and remove the egg with it. Then make a cut below the scrotal skin that bleeds blood and serum as we described earlier, then dip the cotton in oil and place it inside the wound, using the band we described.
And the white duct, which we said should be cut carefully after removing blood, sometimes causes much bleeding. Leave the band until it falls off on its own. If it fails to fall quickly, moisten it with hot water and carry out what heats it until it falls.
Then treat the wound with all treatments for wounds until it heals.
Chapter sixty-six.
In this type of wind injury, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. The first thing that needs to be done is to make the iron according to what we described in the previous chapter. This involves tying the blood vessels below the cut opening gently from underneath.
Then make a cut in the middle and treat the tumor with what opens it until the blood vessels are removed, and then treat the wound as we have instructed until it heals.
Chapter seventy-six.
In the tumor that occurs in the armpit area.
Tumors in the armpit, as we have mentioned, often stay in place and do not extend to the female organs. If they do extend, it's usually a minor issue that resolves over time.
However, if the condition lasts for a long time, the incision in the lymph node may deepen into the chest cavity until it allows bodily fluids and pus to flow out. This exposes the extended lymph node which is situated in the armpit as we have mentioned. And so, the lymph node extends, then relaxes and moves away from its place, causing it to be retracted. The treatment for this would involve using iron as I have previously described its procedure.
It can be treated with iron using this method: the patient should lie on their back between your hands, then you make an incision in the warm tumor area across the body width of about three fingers. Then press the skin's underlying veins.
Until if the white canal that follows opens, you take a thread and place it on the resulting spot of the canal, then press it down to the depth of the abdomen. Then sew both points resulted from the thread on one end of the canal stitch together, and attach each stitch to another.
Then cleanse the affected area without cutting the gallbladder entirely or touching the egg, and do not do anything else as I taught you in treating the cloudy urine. Then treat it with treatments for surgical injuries.
And when the threads have stopped, cleanse it and tighten the wound until it fades. The gallbladder will then close without increasing the hernia.
And the knife is better in this position because it is closer to safety.
The eighty-fourth section.
In relaxing the skin of the scrotum.
The skin of the scrotum often relaxes in some people without relaxing the muscles inside, making its appearance unappealing. Anyone wishing to treat it should lie on their back while fasting.
He cuts all the relaxed skin on top of the tough skin, then brings the lips together. If you wish, you can first sew the relaxed skin with three or four stitches and check them before cutting between the stitches.
Then treat it with other surgical treatments until it heals and the threads fall out.
The ninety-fourth section.
In male circumcision.
Male circumcision is forbidden in our religion.
And that is why I should not mention it in this book of mine, but only do so for two reasons. One: to inform the doctor if asked about it and how to treat those who are affected by it. The other reason is that we often need circumcision on animals for our benefit.
Such as camels, horses, cats and the like of animals. I say that circumcision should be done in two ways: either by moistening or by cutting. If it is done by moistening, its method involves sitting the animal in hot water until its scrotum relaxes, becomes soft and hangs down.
Then manipulate it with your hand until it dissolves and is not recognizable upon touch, whereas castration through incision and cutting requires holding the animal and squeezing its scrotum with your left hand then attaching the clamps and making one cut on each testicle.
Even if the testicles protrude, cut them after剥皮them but do not leave any fat on them except for the delicate one that exists on the veins. This method of castration is better than one achieved through gentle manipulation.
Because gentle manipulation might still leave something of the female characteristics, which may attract the animal to mate. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
In treating feminization (castration).
Castration occurs in men in two ways: one where it manifests as the space or within the skin between female genitalia, appearing like a woman's vagina with hair, and where urine may flow from it if present in the scrotal skin.
As for women, there is only one type which appears above the vagina like a small penis from either side as in men, resembling a man's penis and two female counterparts. The treatment for these three types.
The two types of men and the single type of women should have that excess flesh cut off so that its effect is removed, then treat it with ordinary surgical treatment until it heals. As for the second type of men which produces urine like in scrotal skin, there is no function nor any visible trace of it.
Chapter Eighty-One.
In cutting off the testicles and the flesh arising from female labia.
The testicles might increase in size beyond the natural order, becoming swollen and ugly, and this may be highly valued by some women to the extent that they spread like men and become capable of sexual intercourse.
You should hold the testicle in your hand or with a clamp and cut it, but do not dwell on cutting nor especially at the root to prevent excessive bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical treatments until it heals, and as for the newly grown flesh, it is flesh that grows in the womb mouth to fill it.
It might also protrude outward like a tail. For this reason, some early doctors call it the disease of the tail, and you should cut it in the same way as you would cut a testicle, treating until it heals.
The second section and seventy-fourth chapter.
In treating the harelip.
The harelip refers to a woman's vagina that is not completely closed or has a small hole. It can either be naturally present at birth, or it may occur due to an external cause when the condition advances, often being due to excess flesh.
Or it could be a thin or thick opening, and it can either be within the womb, in its sides, at the top or bottom. It prevents intercourse, the fetus from being born, and potentially urination. Identification of this would be done by observation from the midwife.
If the obstruction is visible and near, but if it's not visible, feel for it with your fingers or a tool. If the obstruction is from thin tissue and close to the lips of the vagina, address by puncturing it. Imagine putting what looks like an aid on the lips, then put all your fingertips together from both hands.
The woman lies on her back with her legs spread. Then, the two arteries are pressed strongly until they pierce the thin skin and the obstruction opens. Afterwards, she takes wool and immerses it in oil, placing it on the site. The woman should reunite every day so that the site does not heal over again.
If the skin is thick and hard, it may be necessary to cut through with a broad scalpel like a piece of paper. If the obstruction is from new flesh, stitch it with catgut and cut it off, have clotting medicines for bleeding without bitterness such as kaqia, zian, milk, and a group of egg whites.
Then, she uses a large lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly. She holds it for days and uses a piece of dry cotton wool afterwards. Treat with all other treatments until it heals. There may be another type of meat in the uterus which might require to be cut like this.
If it is not cancerous, then a cancerous tumor in the uterus does not necessarily receive iron treatment.
The seventy-third chapter.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids, fistulas and red spots that occur in women's thighs.
Regarding hemorrhoids, it is the swelling of the veins' openings so that much blood flows out constantly. If the hemorrhoids occur, they become fistulas. I have mentioned in the previous section their types and symptoms, which we shall now summarize.
What is acceptable for treatment and what is not, I say that hemorrhoids and fistulas when they are deep in the uterus and do not touch the sense of touch, there is no iron treatment inside them. The one who touches the sense of touch is the one that can be treated.
In order that the woman should enter a cold house, then the thighs are rubbed with coarse cloth or a rough branch and cut from their roots, then left when bleeding occurs from one of the arteries stopping blood flow without cauterization.
Like the cacao beans, grains and cheese among others, then she should lift her legs to a wall for an hour then hang them in cold water. If bleeding persists, place her in a mixture of turmeric roots and peels of bitter oranges and such, then take incoherent flour, mix it with honey and vinegar.
Support him with his back, if the bleeding has stopped otherwise apply a hard dressing without any condition to both breasts. Then take wool and dip it in the juice of tarthith plants or the juice of pregnant female's tongue or the juice of branches of alwaaq plant along with orange juice, then bind this place firmly.
If the tumor subsides, treat the area with the ointment until it heals. As for the red pus, it resembles the heads of scabies lice and it is recommended to cut what has appeared from it as described in the thighs, then treat it until healing occurs.
Chapter 47.
In the womb, if there is an outbreak of pus.
Various types of tumors can occur in the womb, such as cancer, calcified tumors, ulcers, ganglia, lymph nodes, hemorrhoids, fissures, thighs, and hot tumors. All these diseases and their various forms and symptoms have been discussed in this section.
In this article, we should mention the hot tumor that appears in the womb among tumors that accumulate for a long time. How its thickness is with iron, you should look if it hurts when it starts, followed by two beats and inflammation and fever.
I saw him red if sensation occurs on him, do not hurry with it and cure him with what promotes maturation until these symptoms settle. Then it becomes appropriate for the woman to sit on a chair with two seats and lean against its back.
And she should gather her legs towards the lower abdomen, make her thighs spread out, and have her arms under her knees, then tie them with a belt that fits.
Therefore, the midwife sits on the right side and uses the device that opens with which she will create its image later in the womb. It is necessary if you want to use this device to estimate the depth of the woman's uterus so that what enters from the device does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
Otherwise, the fetus may be harmed if the device is deeper than the depth of the uterus. It would then be advisable to use wicks on the cervix's lips to prevent the entire device from entering the depth of the uterus. It should also be that the tube running through the device is from the top side.
And you hold the device while the servant moves the tube until it opens the cervix. If the placenta appears and is felt by hand, with a soft and sticky texture, then it should be cut at its head with a wide circumcision knife until all the time has been drained.
It would then be necessary to have a soft wick soaked in rose oil or green oil with some grip, for the wick should stick out of the cut in the cervix. It is also required from outside on the uterus and on the thigh wool that has been immersed in boiling water containing dough.
And then, it is treated with the cream suitable for this purpose for two days until it heals.
And the womb and the wound are washed by injecting with water and honey, then with boiled water containing the root of mastic or a long wormwood. Then return to the ointment, if the discharge is hidden inside the womb.
And you should refrain from treating it with iron, but treat it with what we have mentioned in the section.
The seventy-fifth chapter.
In teaching how to treat live infants if they come out in an unnatural form.
The midwife should first know the natural birth. If you see a woman become pregnant and she leans down, longs to breathe in air, and is relieved by what she experiences during childbirth, then these are signs of it being natural.
And the baby comes out quickly; you should know that this birth is natural and will have the baby emerge on its head along with the placenta or hanging by its tail. If you see these signs, it's advisable to massage her stomach so that the baby can come out fast.
And if it descends onto its head, the placenta will come with it and clean itself properly from this excess. Aside from this birth, all others are not natural and condemned because the baby might come out on its feet and have its hands before its head and feet.
And it might have one hand or foot come out, or the baby's head with a hand or emerge bent, and perhaps turn onto its back and things of this sort condemned forms. The midwife should be cautious and careful about all these matters and avoid mistakes and complications.
And I explain each of its forms and how to deal with it, so you can recognize and respond accordingly. If the baby comes out on its head, this is natural birth and the woman will feel intense pressure making it difficult for her to push, noticing that her strength has weakened. In such a case, sit her down on a chair and ask some women to assist in supporting her.
Lengthen her womb with cooked stew and moist foods, then insert a small sharp tool between her fingers to break up the placenta or scrape it off with her nails until all moisture comes out. Then squeeze her abdomen until the baby drops.
If the baby doesn't come out, it is necessary to inject the woman with saliva of the stew meat mixed with anus oil. Then you should order her after injection to pinch and clear her nostrils and lips by a handkerchief and make tight closure of her mouth and nose. If this method works, the baby will come out from its place; if the baby's hands appear first, it is necessary to gently guide them back little by little.
If the entry doesn't happen, place the woman on a stool and lift her legs up. Then shake the stool gently against the ground while she grips not to fall when shaken. If the hands don't enter and if the baby dies, cut them off then pull out the rest of the baby.
Or tie his hands with a thong and pull them evenly, as he will come out. If the baby comes down on its feet, it is necessary to push them up. Then turn the baby gradually until it becomes upright, then take one of its legs and extend it slowly.
Once they reach the thighs, order her to pinch and clear her nostrils with a handkerchief, as he will come out. If it does not come out in the manner described and otherwise, gently turn the baby back and forth until it becomes natural, then it comes out smoothly at that time. If it did not work according to what we described completely.
Take the saliva from the tongue cleaner, stew meat, anus oil and a dissolved soap, mix all in the ladle with good strokes, then rinse the vagina and the lower abdomen. Then seat her in lukewarm water until the vagina becomes clean.
If you find that the placenta is not coming down, create a bed for it and let it bear it. If the bed holds for an hour, then place her on the chair, then clean her, cover her mouth and nose, and gently press below her abdomen. The fetus will come out from its bed, coming out of the fetus on its knees and hands.
If it comes out in this manner, enter his hands a little at a time. Then the woman lies on her back and stretches her legs downwards while lying on the bed. She folds her arms and then gently presses above her abdomen a little at a time. Then remove what is under her feet from the cushions until she's tipped upside down. If the fetus doesn't come out, take both of her legs and shake them vigorously. Then gently press above her thighs a little at a time, until the fetus moves upwards. Then the midwife will enter her hand and adjust the fetus a little bit at a time.
And order the woman to sway until the fetus comes out, with the fetus emerging as if it's being pushed by one of its hands. Have her push back with her hand. If she can't push back on her own, make the woman stand and let her walk. If she can't walk, have her lie down again.
Place her on a bed and vigorously shake her legs. Then use the tongue stick described, if it takes hold, have her sit in a chair. Then direct hand pushing and adjust the fetus to its natural position. Cleanse the woman and order her to sway until the delivery occurs.
The fetus should emerge with its head flat, its hands stretched out, and its face towards the back of its mother. The midwife should then gently hold the baby's hand and turn it slightly, adjusting it softly until it's in place. Once positioned properly, she should carry it using what was described as a lotion or salve on her forehand.
Then if it moves slightly, slightly. If it does this, I make her sit on the chair and command her to lean towards the right side. Then let it sneeze and clean its nose with the tissue; it will be removed, the baby comes out upright from the side.
If it descends into the uterus in this position with the placenta, cut through the placenta with your fingernail until it is drained of moisture. If it sticks to the baby's face or neck, cut it off from the umbilical cord so that it doesn't choke and dies. Then push the baby inside until you make him fit properly.
Instruct the woman to sneeze several times, for it will come out easily, birth of twins or multiple babies. Know that twins are born very often and they may be born triplets or quadruplets, but they usually live, although this is rare. As for five, it's something outside of nature that simply cannot survive.
They surround them, and if they are numerous, there's a single placenta that separates between them like a barrier through each one's umbilical cord. They can come out as naturally and easily as a single baby would, or they can have an illegitimate birth as we described.
If some of them have difficulty at birth and become in abnormal shapes, treat them as we described. May the woman be gentle and do what she does with care and skill, adapting to each shape according to the trick or strategy that suits her to achieve safety.
Describe what might be conceived in the womb; babies may be conceived. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven or even more than ten could be conceived. It has been confirmed to me that a woman gave birth to seven, and another to fifteen; all of them were those conceived.
To the respected omnipotent, all of this should be in the science of gynecology as it might happen to her someday and she should be prepared for what is required.
The seventy-fourth chapter.
In the removal of dead fetus.
If you treated the dead fetus with the treatment described in the section, and if it did not come out, forcing you to use your hands, then you should look. If the woman is healthy and has no symptoms that might lead to damage as she fears, then the woman should lie on a bed on her back.
Her head should be tilted downwards and her legs raised, with a servant adjusting her from both sides or attaching her to the bed to prevent her body from being pulled when stretching the fetus.
Then, she moistens the womb with wet swabs and saliva from the hump bull and the horse, as well as cottonseed oil. Then, the midwife applies these substances to her hands and uses them along with saliva. She then gently enters her hand into the womb and seeks a spot where needles can be inserted through the fetus or spots that are equivalent to it.
Look, if the fetus is inclined to descend, insert the needles into his eyes or forehead, or in his mouth, or nose, or under his beard, or on his cheekbones, or near the ribs, or under the kidneys.
And if it descends on its legs, then in the elbows and middle backbones. It should be noted that you hold the needle with your right hand and place your left hand's fingers between the palm of your left hand. Insert your hand gently and insert a needle into one of those mentioned locations.
Until you reach an empty space, then insert another or a third hole if needed so that the pull will be equal and not inclined towards any side. Then extend it evenly, so the extension is only at right angles but also moves in all directions.
It should facilitate its removal as is done when pulling out a nail and there ought to be relief in the pull; if it stays on one side, it might happen that rubbing some fingers with grease enters them from this side to rotate what has stayed. If some of the fetus has come out, move the rods to other positions.
You should lift this a little to do this so that the fetus can come out completely, if one hand came out before the other and couldn't be pulled back due to being pressed against something, it might happen that you wrap your fingers around it with a prong then pull it until all of it has come out and cut it.
Either in the elbow joint or in the shoulder blade, and so it should be done with the other hand and with both legs as well. If the head of the fetus is large and has pressure during its exit or if there is collected water inside his head, it might happen that you insert a two-edged instrument between the fingers.
And use it to open the head, so that the water can come out or you might use a device called 'shadakh', which will be shown in pictures with all other devices following this passage.
Similarly, if the fetus has a large head naturally, you should puncture the skull or open it with the shadakh as we have said, then extract the bones with the forceps. If the head has come out and is compressed during the effort to pull, you should puncture until the moisture inside the chest drains.
If the chest joins together, then if it doesn't join and there's no desire for removal, cut off as much as you can. If it is below the belly or has pus, it should be contained so that moisture flows out of it.
If the fetus is on its legs, then drawing it out is easy and moving it to the womb's opening can be done here. If it presses against the abdomen or chest, you should draw it out with a thrust through a sheathed hand, cutting the abdomen or chest until what is inside can drain.
If you have extracted all the organs and pulled back the head, if it is retained, then use your left accessible hand. If the womb's mouth is open, insert your hand into the cervix and guide the head with it, pulling it in with your fingers to the womb's opening. Then, insert a hook or two hooks and pull it with them.
If the womb's mouth has fused with a hot tumor, it should not be forcefully attacked. Instead, at that point, wet objects should be used and syringes employed, sitting in water that relaxes and moistens.
And if the fetus is on its side, it can be turned so that what we mentioned for living fetuses can be used. If this isn't possible, it should be cut and removed. There shouldn't be any remnants of the placenta left inside. After completing your treatment, use the remedies we mentioned for treating hot tumors found within the womb.
If there is a blood flow, you should immerse yourself in a constricted water body and use all the treatments. I have seen a woman who became pregnant again after her fetus died inside her womb.
Then the other fetus also died, and after a long period of time, she had a tumor in her uterus that inflamed until it burst, causing fluid to leak out. I was then called upon to treat her, and after much time of treatment, the wound did not heal completely. So, I applied some strong remedies to exert a pull on it.
Then the bone came out of the place, and days passed; another bone emerged. She was surprised at this, considering that her abdomen is a place without bones, assuming it to be remains of the dead fetus's bones. Upon examining the wound, she found numerous bones, particularly from the head of the fetus.
I continued to follow this, until I removed numerous bones from her. The woman was in the best of health and had been living with such conditions for a long time coming out of the location where there was pus trickling. Here I am bringing forth something rare, which has indeed sustained her through this period.
For it contains knowledge and assistance for what the doctor tries to achieve with his treatment, .
The seventy-seventh chapter.
In this, there are images of the instruments needed for delivering the baby.
A picture of a spindle that opens the cervix:.
This device used to balance books either has two spindles at the ends of the sticks, but this spindle should be softer than the device and either made from willow or reed wood. The width of each stick should be as thick as an index finger.
And the ends of these are about as thick as a finger, and their length is one and a half feet. In the middle of the sticks there are two bars made from the same type of wood that have been attached to them; the length of these might be around half a foot or slightly more. Their width is approximately like a finger's breadth or even slightly more. These two bars serve as support points.
These two that enter the womb's mouth to open your calipers when you operate, picture another device for this purpose softer and lighter:.
They are made from cherry or boxwood in the form of calipers, but each of them has two levers as you see; the length of each lever is about a yard and their width is an inch. If you want to open the womb with it.
Then, the woman sits on a padded bed with her legs spread apart between her thighs. Then, you insert these two levers into the opening of the womb, and while holding one end of the device under both her buttocks, open your hand using the device in the same way as you would use calipers to the extent you want for the opening of the womb. Until what the surgeon desires is done, there's another type of caliper which was mentioned by the early surgeons:.
Illustration of the cannon that pushes the fetus:
Illustration of the forceps that is used to extract the baby's head:.
It resembles scissors with teeth at the end as you see, and it can be made rectangular like calipers on this illustration. It has teeth like chisel's teeth that cut and shave.
Illustration of a cannon also:.
Illustration of a pincushion:.
This pincushion has a slight sharpness to prevent it from breaking when pulling on the baby, illustration of a pincushion with two tongs:.
Illustration of wide clamps for cutting the fetus:.
All these tools, the more types they are and the better prepared they are for the surgeon, the faster he can do his work and the higher is his reputation according to their capabilities. Do not despise having a tool made ready, as there will always be a need for it.
Chapter 87.
In the extraction of the fetus.
If the placenta is retained after delivery, you should advise the mother to hold herself still, then blow on her with a fan and grip her mouth and nose. If it comes out this way, otherwise take a portion.
And make a hole in the cover, and place therein opened herbs for the womb mouth like fenugreek, senna, cardamom, borage, mint, parsley, and juniper. These medicines or some of them should be immersed in water and put on fire. Then place a gold tube on the hole of the lid's cover and the other end inside the womb mouth.
Hold it until the steam reaches the womb's bottom, then blow as we said before; the placenta will quickly come out. If it hasn't left after this treatment, the surgeon should advise to immerse her left hand in a sheargun oil or garlic saliva.
Then insert it into the uterus and feel for the placenta; when you touch it, hold onto it gently and pull it a little at a time until it comes out. If it is attached deep in the womb, then place your hand as described until you find the placenta, then gradually draw it towards the abdomen.
To avoid the uterus falling out under strong pulling, it is necessary to gently move it to the right and left sides first. Then increase the amount of pulling gradually; she then responds at that time and frees herself from being stuck. If the womb mouth is closed together, we have described the treatment by blowing on it and using the lid cover and herbs as well.
If it doesn't come out as described, then you must use force in pulling again. But it's necessary to connect what has come out from her to the womb mouth to the woman's thigh; then bathe her with the four ointments for cleanliness; she will become clean after a few days.
The healing and discharge occurs only if it doesn't get infected, for when it does become infected, a bad smell ascends from it to the stomach and head causing injury. It is advisable that appropriate incense be used in this situation.
Therefore, some of the pioneers tried the incense of herbs and dried grapes. The picture of the machine used by women when there is retention of menses or remnants and similar conditions:.
It is made of lead that resembles a caul or it is made of copper in which the thin end goes into the mouth and the wide end on the fire. The incense is made to stick onto it until the incense goes away, then repeats with another one, until this process continues.
The 9th and 74th chapter.
In treating the non-punctured hemorrhoids.
Many boys are born with their hemorrhoids not punctured, perhaps it is sealed by a thin fold. It would be advisable for the midwife to pierce this fold with her finger; otherwise, she should press it with a sharp pincers and take care not to touch the muscles.
Then, she places on it wool that has been soaked in water and oil. Then, treat him with ointments until it heals. If you fear that it will block, put a copper pipe into the hole for many days, remove it when the child wants to defecate.
The obstruction of the hemorrhoids might also result from a wound or tumor, it would be necessary to cut this concretion and then treat it with the mentioned treatment methods and tincture.
Chapter Eighty.
In treating the inguinal hernias that occur below.
The stricture that occurs below is a complication and obstruction that happens near the anus from outside or in the space of one side. It can be one or more strictures.
If that obstruction loosens, it opens and allows moisture-rich water or clear pus to pass out. It may originate from these strictures entering the anal opening and the intestines, and if not penetrating they might be recognized by what is expelled with feces and body odor when using enemas.
It might also expel worms, and these could be strictures if they penetrate into the bladder and the urethra. They may also enter at joints of the thigh and behind the knee, or recognized as a stricture entering the anus from outside without penetration.
To enter your thumb in the anus, and insert a thin probe made of copper or iron into the stricture. If there is no ridge on the stricture, then use a thin lead probe or a hair from horse's mane.
Until you feel the probe or hair in your finger. If you don't feel it at all and there's nothing like feces, body odor or worms popping out as we said, know that it is not penetrating. Proceed to treatment immediately.
If the stricture is penetrating into the bladder or urinary tract, its sign is urine coming out from it and its inability to heal with medicine. However, if it's penetrating into the thigh joint or behind the knee, then you can tell when the probe reaches that area.
If there is no ridge leading to the bone, and if there is pain around a certain direction with pus always coming out from it, then there is no cure for this nor does it heal over time. And all such penetrating strictures lack any possibility of complete recovery.
Treatment for it is a futile effort for those who attempt it among the uneducated physicians, and as for the non-infectious and non-chronic cases, I hope their healing through ironing over them as described and experimented by me, which involves laying the sick person on their back before you.
He raises his legs upwards and inclines his calves towards his abdomen. Then a steel or lead probe is inserted inside the naqshab (a type of instrument used in surgery), if it's present during the surgical preparation, until one knows where the probe ends. If he feels discomfort near the chair, you should insert your middle finger into the seat.
If you feel that the probe in your finger has come out by itself without touching it with your finger or flesh, then be assuredly it is infectious and do not waste effort on it for there will be no healing from it as we have said.
They have said that it heals in some people, though rarely. And from treatments that are hoped to be beneficial, one should use a thin iron rod according to the size of the naqshab as was mentioned earlier, then insert it inside the naqshab until it reaches near the seat. Then withdraw and reinsert it two or three times.
Until you understand that it has burned all the excess, swollen flesh that resembles a bird's feather tube. Then treat it with a tourniquet dipped in oil until the burned flesh is removed. Then apply poultices made of salt until it heals if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal without any other treatment. As for when you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger in the seat, there is a thick barrier between the probe and it did not penetrate into the skin beneath the naqshab. If you see the naqshab below the skin surface, then cut the skin from the first naqshab. You pass through the cut with the scalpel while it is in the parotid gland until you reach the end of the cut where the tip of the scalpel lies. The scalpel discards and drops there, then you cleanse the flesh that has been cut resembling a bird's feather tube leaving nothing behind.
Then, treat him with the antiseptic ointment until it heals. If your blood overwhelms you and obstructs your work of cutting off that flesh, what is best for you to do and gives a quicker benefit is to burn it or with a strong medicine because burning it with fire gathers two good conditions; burning off those excess meats.
Cut off the blood and evaporate the moisture, then treat him with ointment mixed in fat or powdered sulfur in oil until pus comes out, and those burned meats are excreted through pus. Then, when that's done, treat the wound with antiseptic ointments made for hard meat healing.
These are the medicines that have grip and evaporation. If it gets stuck, it heals without returning. If the parotid gland has reached its depth inside the socket after the surface of the body, put your finger in the socket and search with it.
If you feel the scalpel between it and a barrier of fat or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there's no work in it but on the path of greed and hope. This involves using one of three methods: either by sharpening it as we mentioned,
Or, by making a cut until you reach its bottom in order to be able to insert the ointment and treat close without extending the cut so as not to cut the surrounding muscle tissue. This might cause involuntary bowel movement then treat it as we mentioned; it may heal as we said.
Either perform this operation of piercing the incision until close to the retractor as we described, either using a forceps or another sharp instrument. Then remove all that tissue bulging within the entire cut until you can reach it through exploration.
Then remove the entire wound, including the cut and the upper mouth, until it seals up, leaving the nostril open inside the retractor. This will be easier on the patient. The nostril may become constricted in this position.
And when you insert the forceps into the nostril and it is in one side of the retractor towards the body surface with skin and around the circumference of the retractor, take then a forceps sharpened at the tip like an awl as shown in this figure:
And insert a coiled thread made of five threads or approximately so, then insert the forceps with the thread into the nostril until it reaches its bottom. If it is curved in the rim of the retractor from inside near by.
Then remove the thread from that hole by putting your finger into the retractor and pulling out the end of the thread, then gather both ends together and pull them tightly. Leave it for a day or two, each time the thread cuts through the flesh tighten it firmly until those tissues between the ends of the threads get cut and fall off. Then treat the wound until it heals.
If the nostril's opening is not curved, force it as much as possible but do not let it go deep enough that you might damage the muscle. Do what we instructed until it heals.
A picture of the spinal tweezer that cuts through the nostrils has its tip very sharp for the cauterization, and the other side is not so sharp to avoid cutting what does not need it as you see:
Chapter Fifty-Eight.
In the case of haemorrhoids that bleed and their removal, and treatment for fissures.
Haemorrhoids can be divided into two types: either they are inside the anus resembling blood vessels or as if they were grapes, with some being small and others large, bleeding continuously from them.
They can be singular or numerous, and located outside the anus, except that these found outside the anus are less common and have a low moisture content. They continuously produce yellow water or slightly bloody liquid, and they have the color of the body.
For treatment when the hemorrhoids are inside the anus, you should ask the patient to stand up and take a bowel movement until they show themselves to you. Then, quickly tie them with strings or hold them with your finger, then cut them at their roots once you have released them from the strings due to their moisture and relaxation.
Grip them with a coarse prong or a piece of sharpened reed, or pull them with your fingers. Then cut them and apply some sharp needles after cutting to replace the knots, or scrape them as instructed in the section on knots.
Then treat it with all other remedies until recovery occurs. If the anus does not allow for an easy exit, you should inject a syringe containing a little brine into the patient to cleanse what's in the anus and prompt quick evacuation upon the patient's straining. For hemorrhoids that are outside the anus, this is easily accomplished as instructed.
This involves holding it with your finger or attaching it to a string and cutting it, then treating it as we have mentioned until recovery occurs. If one dislikes cutting with iron, it would be advisable to use her haemorrhoids in this manner by taking a twisted thread and inserting it into an needle.
Then draw the worms upwards and remove them with a needle from its original location on the opposite side, twist both ends of the string under the needle which is in front, pull the thread tightly then tie it, and finally take out the needle. She performs this on all the worms but leaves one intact not to cut it.
To cleanse her of the blood, then she places on the stool a piece of cloth dipped in oil or ointment and places it on the stool. She commands the patient to rest, then leaves him until the worms drop out. When the worms fall out, she treats them with applications and all treatments until she clears them off.
As for treating fissures, they often occur due to dryness of the faeces and retention of feces. If they do not heal in it, medication might be required to cure them. It is advisable to cleanse it with a scalpel or your finger until it becomes moist, removing the upper layer of skin that prevents its healing.
Then treat it until it heals as necessary, if it doesn't heal completely, repeat with even more vigorous cleansing until it heals properly and sheds its skin, then treat it. It will then be healed.
The second section and the eightieth chapter.
In treating inverted and non-inverted nails, dried worms, and bed bugs.
Indeed, the nail is only a looped knot that matches the body's color resembling the head of the nail. It is present throughout the body but especially in the lower legs and fingers, causing pain when walking.
It is necessary to cut around the nail, hold it with a file or by a plier and remove its root. Then treat it, if you wish strengthen it according to what has been discussed in its section. As for dried worms (thåliy), each one of them is a small, coarse, twisted, round worm above the body surface.
Often found in the hands of boys and their treatment, it involves lengthening the foreskin and cutting or tying it with silk thread or a hair until it falls off; if you wish, you can tighten it as was previously done with fire or medicine.
And the reversed and non-reversed worms have been removed by the device that I mentioned in treating the wasp. The wasp, however, is also a small coiled thin worm on the surface of the body going very deep inside; if it gets cold, she feels something like a sting.
It can be throughout the body and more so in the hands, its treatment involves taking a tube from an ostrich or a strong eagle's feather. This tube encircles the wasp until it surrounds him on all sides, then you turn your hand with the tube to cut around the wasp.
And make it deep into the flesh, causing the wasp to detach from its root. If you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube like this:.
The top of the tube is made smooth and elastic to facilitate control with fingers and to tighten it. If you wish, you can treat the wasp as in tying worms in a section on tying worms under the heading of tying them.
The thirty-eighth chapter.
In the illustrations of the machines used for administering injections in colic, diarrhea, and constipation.
The syringe can be made of silver, porcelain, or brass (either polished or hammered). It can also be made in small and large sizes according to the needs of its users. The syringe used for treating smaller children is small, and those with narrow or constricted colons have very gentle syringes. Image of a large syringe:.
The superior constriction that connects the yoke is wide on this condition, which has a barrier where the yoke is connected as you see. The lower end of the yoke, which enters the socket, is very smooth to the point of making holes in one of its sides two holes, and on the other side, one hole.
The size of the hole should be firm or slightly firmer, and the yoke for making medicine in an animal bladder or from sheepskin hide should be made in the shape of a small ladle with its diameter being about a finger.
It should have many holes like a comb, and there should be about an inch between each hole. Then, a thin thread made from the yarn of ten threads or close to it would be inserted into each hole. The yoke should be gathered like a ladle. If you place the medicine in it, pull firmly on the syringe's head between the two stones with a tight and narrow pull, then inject it. This is how the yoke and hole should look:.
And how to heat it: fill the sheepskin or bladder with medicine while it is warm up to a possible degree of evaporation, be cautious that it should not be too hot or too cold. Then, the recipient lies on their back and raises their legs upwards.
Place something like a cloth or mattress underneath him/her. Then, smear the syringe's tip with grease or egg white or saliva of a camel, or similar substances. Gently insert it into the bladder and then take both ends of the yoke in your hands and squeeze them firmly until all the contents of the syringe are emptied into the stomach.
Then remove the syringe and have him/her raise his/her legs up to the wall. If the medicine prompts him/her to urinate, he/she will pass as much as he/she can. If he/she sleeps through the night, it may help in digestion completely. If it's used for diarrhea cases and its administration is rushed, repeat the process until he/she recovers.
If there are painful masses or swellings in the scrotum, then the syringe should be very gentle and smooth compared to those used on children. This is a picture of a gentle syringe that has its skin attached.
The fortieth and fourth chapter.
In the treatment of wounds.
I have mentioned in the previous section how to treat something like a boil. Here, I'm discussing its treatment by hand and with medications at their finest. I say that surgical wounds vary according to what they involve and where they occur on the body.
The things that the surgical wounds may involve are numerous, like a stone hit by a hammer, a cut from a sword or a knife, a thrust with an arrow or spear, and such other many things.
And as for the wounds according to their locations in the body, such as those that occur on the head or neck, chest, abdomen, liver and other organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to serve as a measure and law for all other wounds. I begin with simple head injuries, especially since their details will be found in early sections of this book under 'The Head'.
I say that if there was a simple wound on the head and no fracture of bone, then observed whether it came from a stone or something similar; had only the skin been pushed in, despite the size of the wound, I feared the occurrence of the hot tumor. Act immediately and use the camel's hair to remove the obstruction. Don't delay this, and remove as much blood as its strength allows. If there is no preventer of bleeding and especially if the blood that comes out from the wound barely flows, make sure the bleeding is from the opposite side of the injured area.
Warn against overfilling, drinking and consuming dense foods; one who prevents the release of semen should reduce his food intake, refrain from meat and beverages, and bear on his wound if it gets infected with a hot cotton ball soaked in rose oil alone or with drink containing grip.
If the hot lump is purged, bear on the wound if it becomes moist with its blood and has not changed due to the essential oil I will describe shortly. If it has indeed changed because of air, apply some ointments on it.
Until the pus is drained and it's treated until recovery, if the wound is large and due to cuts like a sword or similar, and its edges do not meet with the sutures, then stitch it together as I describe in stitching abdominal surgeries.
If the skin is revealed over bone and it's adhered, but only attached due to a slight hold, cut it then treat the wound with medications that force in solid meat instead of skin. The patient should eat foods with toughness such as heads and horns, etc.
If there is a pus in the skin that does not stick to the bone, cut off all the infected part and burn it then treat. If within these surgeries is an artery or vein bleeding from which blood is flowing without medication stopping the blood, search for it on the artery or vein.
If it does not heal, shave it with a razor and tie. If necessity calls for it but what we mentioned is ineffective, bleed it until the blood stops. For small, simple surgeries, treatment is easy; you can treat them by leaving this essential oil on it which heals through its blood.
Before it is changed by the air, a recipe of the derrars suggests taking one part from the milk and two parts from the fat. From smoldering or unsmoldered dung he takes three parts, grinds everything together, sieves it, packs it in the wound, pulls tight with good tension until it sticks well.
The blood clots then, and it is pulled up by the threads from above. It is left undisturbed as long as it does not swell; for the medicine will not leave him until he recovers. And sometimes, dung alone can achieve this if neither milk nor fat are available.
This action can also be performed with animal glue in many major surgeries if it is done properly and tightened, provided that the wounds remain moist due to their blood. However, if some change has been made by the air or especially during summer time, then this could not work.
It is not in using this derrars method effectively as we have mentioned that it should be applied with some ripe ointments or an oat flour paste mixed with water and honey until the pus drains, after which further treatment should be carried out with all other remedies until recovery.
However, if there is a fracture in the wound which occurs in the bone and it's mild, you can pull it by the hair. I have mentioned treating head fractures as they resume, in neck surgery, so if the wound happens to be in the neck, there would not be any difference in treatment compared to a simple head injury.
However, if a nerve or an artery has been cut in the neck, if it's a nerve there is no trick other than avoiding treating it with very strong gripping remedies like pincers and picks and such as they hurt the nerve and irritate it.
Do not apply anything icy to the wound, for the essence of nerves is cold and they are in contact with the brain which is the finest organ. The medicines that are treated therefrom by gentle remedies like the paste washed with pure water or coated with oil or rose butter and myrtle.
If you also wash it with pure water and other metallic stones in this way, or use greasy ointments, then for a large wound stitch it or join its edges with sutures. Then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has a cavity and there is an abscess at its bottom where pus has accumulated, bathe it in the lowest point of this. If a blood vessel has been cut in the wound causing bleeding, stop the bleeding or tie it off with a ligature if necessary.
If the wound has cut through some of the cornea or all of it and the eyelid is hanging down, sew together the edges of the skin on the cornea with stitches. Do not touch the cornea but place it back in its natural shape by suturing firmly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have a tightening and drying effect until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, drill through it. If there are pieces of bone in it, extract them all or what is possible; if not, leave it until the wound cleanses itself and heals, making its removal easier.
If the wound is tender, dust it with the rhubarb that we have described. If bone has been removed from the wound and it has become smooth, treat it according to what is mentioned in its chapter, for chest surgery and between the shoulders.
If the thrust is from a spear or a knife and you see a wound, examine it to see if there's air coming out when the patient breathes. If so, know that this is a fatal injury caused by bleeding. If there is no wound appearance and it's clean of blood, do not treat it with immediate cautery therapy nor tighten it, lest the blood be confined in its cavity.
He summons the heart to kill, yet apply it in moderation and renew this treatment twice during the day. If this fails to work, place a small piece of cotton in the wound's mouth to absorb any seeping moisture, and have the patient rest on the wound.
Don't let what has gathered within harm him. If it's been three days or more since the wound occurred, and the patient doesn't exhibit any convulsions, bad heartbeats, or difficulty breathing, and all other conditions are healthy, know that the wound is safe. Treat it with cautery and other remedies until he recovers.
If he cannot be seen and if the cautery remains constantly hot, know that it has become hard. The ill patient resting on the wound does not allow what gathers within to harm him; if the chest or back is affected by the wound, treat it with the stitches progressed to.
If it's large or using cautery, if it's small, if it has affected the bone and broken pieces are inside, inspect the wound and promptly remove those clean pieces. If they're not clean, leave them for now.
The wound should be cleaned as it facilitates removal of its contents. As for other sudden injuries to all organs, their treatment rules follow what we have mentioned.
Chapter Fifty-Eight.
In surgery of the abdomen and removal of entrails and their suturing.
The abdominal breach can be large, small or medium. A large one may release intestines or parts of the intestine making its insertion and suturing more difficult and challenging.
And the small breach may complicate matters differently, requiring that returning it be harder. If the intestines do not quickly enter their place in time, they balloon and become hard, making their insertion more difficult. That's why the medium-sized breaches are considered better than those two types as they do not make it as complicated to return the intestines.
And know that suturing the abdomen involves four aspects. The two general stitches are suitable for suturing the abdomen and other bodily surgeries, whereas the remaining two are special ones applicable to all surgeries except they are especially suited for suturing the abdomen.
And I'll describe it to you with explanation and clarification, saying that if the wound is small and something from the intestines came out making it hard to return, this can be due to two reasons: either for its small size as we mentioned or perhaps because of bloating caused by air before coldness set in.
If this is the case, it should be heated by immersing a sponge or cloth in hot water and allowing it to absorb only that water. Or perhaps after boiling it with ingredients such as coriander seeds, saffron and fennel, the intestines can be rubbed until the bloating dissolves.
And one might do this with the drink that has been boiled, which is better than water alone in dissolving bloating. Once you see the bloating has dissolved, cool the intestines down by rinsing them with water that has been boiled with barley or bread; this makes it easier for them to enter their proper place.
If recovery does not occur after this treatment, cut slightly in the incision with the instrument used for nail removal. The first treatment is better than cutting if it enables recovery. However, cutting becomes necessary only when all other methods fail, and this is how the tool looks:
One of its ends is curved and limited, while the other end is unlimited. The delicate tip does not sparkle like a pincers but is slightly flattened. It resembles a small nail as you see it. If the wound widens and the contents penetrate, it should return in its natural form.
It has its specific place if you can manage it, which is preferable. If the cut is extensive and located at the bottom of the abdomen, the patient should lie on his back with his legs raised above his head. If it's at the top of the abdomen, he should raise his head and chest above his lower part.
And similarly, if the cut is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, always aim and strive to make the area with the surgery higher than the other side. In this way, it should be used in major surgeries and medium-sized surgeries.
And in minor surgeries, place it as you can manage. Then prepare beside you a servant to assist who holds the incision with both hands and joins his lips together. Then he gradually reveals pieces of stitching after piece for the suture team.
This is the general rule for common stitching; you should take one or several needles according to the size of the wound. Leave at each end of the incision a distance equal to the thickness of the bone. Then, insert one needle without threading it through the skin edges. With the edges of the skin inside that go through it from that side, having gathered both my skin margins and those of the bone until there are four points. Then I pull a doubled thread around the needle from both sides many times, until both wound edges meet tightly.
Then leave the thickness of the finger nails also. Then insert another needle and tie it with a thread as she did with the first needle, do the same thing with any other needles until you drain all of the wound, let the needles be medium between hardness and softness.
Because the very soft needles cut the flesh and the nails too easily, making it difficult to enter the skin. Therefore, it should be medium in softness and hardness. It's not advisable to insert the needle close to the edge of the skin tightly.
So that the flesh does not cut off too quickly and the wound does not open before healing, nor should you sew too far apart so as not to prevent the wound from healing. Then cut the ends of the needles so they do not harm the patient when sleeping, and provide him with wadding made of muslin from all sides that holds the needle ends.
And leave it until you know that the wound has healed. This kind of sewing with needles is like this suitable for small surgeries because it may be enough in sewing it with one or two needles, or about them.
As for the stitch of the second commoner, it is to gather with the stitches the four edges meaning the edge of the skin and the edge of the wound in one stitch with a thread that is well stretched and medium between softness and hardness. Then if you pulled these four edges out using this needle, return the needle from the side where it started itself.
The thread should be knotted from above the wound so that the stitch is like the stitch of the sack that is tightened with the bandage and there is between each stitch and stitch after the small finger nail tightness. This stitch is known to all people.
By this type of stitching, surgery was performed on a man who had been cut by a knife. The surgical wound exceeded the length of one span and blood had flowed from his intestines towards two spans from the middle intestine. The cut was in the center of the abdomen.
He had his intestines protruding from the wound for twenty-four hours. The surgical wound healed in about fifteen days and he was treated until he recovered completely, living many years after that, behaving normally under all conditions. The doctors would always pronounce him as fully recovered.
It is amazing that I did not apply a poultice to him as there was no medicine available where I was. Instead, I would place the used cotton on the wound twice a day and wash it with honey water until he recovered.
As for the two types of specialized stitching, I refer to Galen's description which instructs that one should start by sewing from the skin, piercing the needle from outside to inside. Once the needle is passed through the skin and into the muscle layer at an angle across the entire length of the abdomen in a straight line.
I left the edge of the wound on the side where I inserted the needle and passed it through that edge to the other from outside to inside in the other margin. Once it was passed, I passed it again within that same edge from inside to outside.
And leave the margin of the wound on this side, then pass the needle through the other margin from inside to outside. And as you pull it out, also extend it into the wound's margin on its opposite side until all of it is passed through.
Then begin again from the same side, and align this with the margin of the wound from the other side of the wound. Remove the needle from the skin near it, then return to that skin and draw along its line. Align the margin of the wound on the other side with this margin of the intestine.
Remove it from the skin on its side, do this once more and repeat it again and again until all surgery is sewn in this example. The whole character of this sewing should be like the sewing of the fur for the sheep.
By sewing the wound once on one side with a fold of skin and leaving it open from another side until it heals, as for the second type of Galen's special sewing method that Galen also mentioned, this is just written word by word.
It is when you stitch it on a model where some of the surgeons assemble each part to its counterpart, naturally they include a fold of the wound with its fold and a fold of the cavity with its fold. And this is just as I have described to you.
It is necessary that you pierce the needle near to the nearby cavity from outside and insert it inside of her alone, then leave its fold of the wound. Then turn the needle and enter it from outside to inside in the fold of each wound. Then also turn it again.
You then insert it from inside to outside in the fold of the other cavity which is on the opposite side, this way of sewing is better than the easy common sewing which she mentioned, that is what Galen said word for word. And some say that stomach stitches can be made with two needles. That is, you should insert one thread into both of them and start by inserting the needle from here to the other side, then insert the other needle from the opposite side to yours according to the way of sewing the eyelids.
And know that if the puncture is in the middle of the abdomen, its stitching is harder compared to other parts of the abdomen. As for healing the wound, it has the same rule as with other surgical wounds; when you carefully inspect the wound filled with blood before it's changed by air and repeat the antiseptic washes and stitches, you then apply the ointment.
If the wound has changed due to air, apply some of the ointments that suit you until it discharges and removes the threads, then heals with the scab and pus. Then treat it as you would any other wound until it recovers.
If the medicines do not suit you, apply the old cotton wadding when it starts to drain and change it twice a day as I taught you until it heals. In most cases, you won't need any other treatment if the wounds are simple; fear that the wound might share the main pain with the body parts.
You should soak our cotton in medium heated oil or rose butter, and place it around the areas between the ribs and the elbows. If he feels pain or itching on his back, this often indicates that he needs to drink a tight, smoking black beverage.
And especially if the fungus has reached his intestines and created an open wound in it, know that what was hard in his intestines is easier to heal, and what was soft is more difficult to heal.
And as for the intestine known to fasting, it does not accept healing through surgery that affects its integrity due to the abundance of veins and bones in it, and its soft muscle and proximity to nerve nature. And as for what emerged from the wound being a hole and detected in soft tissue, return it according to how your intestinal response is, whether you return it normally or not.
If it has passed a period and turned green or black, it should be desirable to tighten it with thread over the area that darkened from him so as not to expose bleeding. There are veins and arteries in the hole, then cut what is below this ligament.
And make both ends of the thread attached from below the incision outside it to facilitate your tying and removal when the hole falls and discharges, note the wound that appears in the intestine. If there was a tear in the intestine and it was small.
If in some cases one might be forced to see a man who had pricked inside his abdomen with an arrow, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, I would seal the wound and it became red, emitting feces and gas from it. So I would elevate him hoping that I did not wish for his recovery. I continued to nurse him until he recovered and the place healed. When I saw that the wound had healed, I feared for the weak one that something bad might happen in his abdomen, so I did not allow any such bad event to occur to him and he remained in the best of his conditions. He is healthy, eats, drinks, has intercourse and enters the bathroom; he also bathes and serves himself. Some practitioners mentioned that if a wound appears in the stomach and it's small, it should heal with this condition.
He instructs to take the bigger ants, remove their heads then gather the edges of the wound. Place an ant with its mouth open on the wound edge; when it catches onto it and tightens its jaws, its head gets cut off and sticks there without coming off. Then place another ant nearby the first one.
Keep doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then push it back and sew up the wound. Those heads will remain stuck inside the stomach until the stomach heals and recovers completely without harming the weak one in any way. It might be possible for the intestine to also stick by the fine thread.
The one who pulls out the sticky animal from Egypt when it enters an arrow is that you take a small end of this thread from the animal, pull it gently then tie a thin cotton thread around its end. Then insert that thread into the arrow. In it, the thread of the bladder is stitched with its interior lining and then returned to the abdomen. This method of sewing with thread and bladder stitch is indeed on the path of greed and hope.
And if the tear is large and wide, especially if it's in one of the small intestines, there is no trick or escape from it at all.
The sixty-eighth chapter.
In treating the sore throat and the white spot [or condition]".
Be aware that every wound or tumor, if it lasts and progresses, becomes a crater-like injury that hasn't healed, and when pus continues to ooze without ceasing, it is called an ulcer regardless of where in the body it may be. We refer to this condition as a sore throat.
It's in reality, a complicated intertwined hard white mass with pain, having a cavity like that of a bird's feather.
That's why some call it a feather. It can sometimes be moist, continuously releasing pus, and the moisture might sometimes stop. The amount of this moisture can vary - it can be plentiful, scarce, thick or fine.
And when discussing operations, it was mentioned that every crater that doesn't heal or grow flesh in does so for one of nine reasons. One reason could be due to the body's lack or insufficiency of blood, another because of its sluggish state, and yet another is when within it or on its edges there is hard flesh preventing the growth of healthy flesh. And it could be because of excessive pus and filth, or because the crater itself is infected with a bad substance spreading from it. Or perhaps the medicine used in treatment isn't suitable for it, or there's infection due to botulism that occurred during surgery, or it has a specific condition.
And it could be because of excessive pus and filth, or because the crater itself is infected with a bad substance spreading from it. Or perhaps the medicine used in treatment isn't suitable for it, or there's infection due to botulism that occurred during surgery, or it has a specific condition. As it is shown in the city of Saragossa where healing of diseases is difficult and growth of tumors slows down naturally, either due to a single bone or several bones. All these reasons, their symptoms, and their treatments with medicines have been explained in this section.
And I must introduce you to the treatment of scabies and dysentery which works through hand practice, know that scabies can occur in all body parts, some end up in large arteries or veins or nerves.
Or to the chest, or to the bowel, or to the bladder, or to a rib of the ribs, or to a joint in the complex joints such as the hand and foot, and some go close to the main organ and so on.
If these scabies are like this, they are among the easy-healing diseases that do not accept treatment and make efforts to heal them a hard task. If some of the scabies have not reached those mentioned locations which I desired and hoped for their treatment.
And I wanted to know this, take a metal comb, either of brass or iron, if the scabies follows straight lines, comb through it. If there is a twist in the scabies, use a thin lead comb because lead will glide over its body easily.
It becomes slippery when entering, and it bends towards the twist. If the scabies has many mouths that you can't identify with a comb, then insert one mouth from its many mouths. The moisture injected this way will flow towards the other mouths and drain out.
From there, conduct thorough examination in any way you can to know if there is a bone or nerve, whether the scabies is deep or close, or if it's one with many mouths. Use your strength and knowledge of its presence by feeling where it hurts when you touch the area with your hand.
Such indications and occurrences related to the tumor, if one stands on all of this with a truthful stance, then in that case, one would rely upon treatment based on observation. If it is determined.
The lion seems to be visible soon or in a safe place far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein or any of the places you were informed about. The lion should cut according to the previous description and remove the parts containing conglutination and bad meat as well as excessive meat.
What grows in its mouth from meat or cavities and such, and treat it until it heals. If the lion is deep-rooted but straight, you should cut deeply as much as possible then clean it off all of its bad meat.
Then use the prepared young shoots in strong medicines and insert them into the inner depth of the lion which you reach with iron. Do this repeatedly until that strong medicine eats up all remaining corruption at the bottom of the lion.
Force him with the ointments that stimulate healthy growth until he heals. If it does not heal through this, cut and treat him according to your previous instructions. If the cause of the lion is bone and you consider that situation fit, probe and cut him as previously informed. If there's an obstacle preventing you from doing so, do not proceed.
Or if it's a nerve or a main organ as we said, if you find the bone and there is some corruption and darkness in it, strip it until all its corruption goes away. Then treat him to heal it so that he heals; if he doesn't heal and his discharge continues as before.
Understand that you have not reached complete removal of the corruption. Therefore, expose all what is on it again and investigate by stripping and thoroughly cleaning it with your best effort. Then force him, if he heals; otherwise, understand that this corruption is in a deeper place from the existing corruption and expose all what is on it again.
Probe and clean the bone with your utmost effort, the rotten bone is a small one and can be extracted. You can extract it by using gentle ligatures that are suitable for this.
If there are many bones, probe and pull them all out without leaving anything. Use your strength until you have removed everything. If a ligament obstructs you that is not in the cut, but it does not pose any danger, then cut those ligaments and meat if there is any, and remove the bones completely.
If you do not have time to remove the bones, cover the wound with what cleans it and leave it for days until the area around those bones, meat and ligaments becomes clean. Keep the wound open so that the cut you made during your work does not heal.
But if you fear that, place on it a cloth soaked in powdered sulfur with oil or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. When those ligaments cleanse and bone dries, extracting and pulling them becomes easier.
If it is a large bone, such as the leg bone or the thigh bone and similar, and if it was only its surface that had decayed, strip it completely naked until that blackness and decay go away. Then force the wound open; however, if the part that decayed was a large portion of it and the decay has reached inside the bone, it will be necessary to cut through.
And cut it all down to where the decay ends, then operate until it heals. I will tell you about a case that was presented to a man in his leg for an example and guidance in your treatment; this man was past old age.
Approaching thirty years old, he was presented to him with pain in his leg due to movement within the body that caused materials to reach the leg and swelling. A large bone had formed and it wasn't from anything external. Over time, with medical errors, the lump opened.
Many materials were derived from it and it was poorly treated in its treatment until the leg became discolored. There were numerous mouths all of which excreted pus and bodily moisture there, and a group of physicians worked on it for about two years, and among them no one had a skilled handcraftsmanship.
Until I saw his leg and the materials were flowing from those mouths like a huge stream, and the body of the leg had dissolved and turned yellow. So I inserted the forceps into one of those mouths, it led to the bone with the forceps, then cut all the mouths.
I found that some of them led to each other from all directions of the leg, so I pricked one of those mouths until I revealed part of the bone. It was rotten and blackened, corroded and discolored until the hole reached the inner lining of the leg, spreading what it disclosed to me.
I was able to remove the rotten bone, assuming that there wasn't any other decay in the bone which I cut and spread. And then removed it again. Then after a longer period of time, with ointments and medication, it didn't heal. So I returned and revealed the bone once more over the initial examination.
I found the decay attached to the bone. I spread what was revealed to me also from that decay, then forced him against his will but he neither healed nor closed off. So I opened it up again and kept cutting pieces of the bone and treating them with medication, but none would heal until I cut about a foot of the bone.
I removed it along with his inner lining, then treated him with medication and he healed quickly and was cleansed. This repetition in his case and the depth of the operation was necessary due to his weakened condition and lack of endurance, I feared for his death as he would often suffer excessive drainage that would cause malodorous discharge. He recovered completely and thoroughly from this healing.
When a solid flesh forms in the place of a bone, and it heals within its body, reduces its strength, acts according to its conditions, and does not suffer harm due to walking that would fundamentally damage him, if it was a broken bone that occurred in a part of the body.
In this case, you should take a bandage and tighten it on the end of the formed bone. You should ask someone to hold it above it and create another strap from thicker wool than the first one.
Then, you should attach it to the flesh beneath the bone and let its end draw the flesh down. You should expose the flesh so that you do not harm the incision site and place a plank or a board under the bone from below firmly.
Because if you do it like that, the dissection will not prevent cutting off the rotten bone. It is necessary for the cut to be slightly above the decayed place so that there's no disease in the bone cavity, which wouldn't appear visible for the observer; thus, you would have to make another cut.
If the bone is rotten and isn't formed, but it's connected with some to others, with decay in its middle or in some parts, expose all of the flesh from all its sides. Then, place the board from below, and spread it from the first side where the decay is.
When you are done with spreading from one side, spread from the other side. Let the spreading be slightly away from the decay as we have said, if the decay is in a joint, cut out that decaying section itself and spread the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the decay is in a connection of two joints, there's no trick other than excision. If the decay is in the hand fork or arm fork, it's very hard to treat, but you should peel off the decay as much as you can see and remove and clean it on any condition that you can.
How do you realign bones if there is no resistance from sweat or nerves, and know that the sections and ligaments for cutting these bones vary greatly depending on the position of the bone, its orientation, hardness, texture, size, grandeur, stiffness and fragility. For this reason, it is necessary to prepare machinery for each type of work for that task.
And know that the tasks themselves will guide you on what kind of machinery you need, if you have a long road and knowing the arts of this trade because it is the skill in this craft and seeing examples of diseases. And he can derive for himself what suits him from machines for each disease, and I will show you several machines at the end of this chapter.

Chapter seventy-eight.
In cutting limbs and dispersing bones.
Limbs may rot either due to a cause external or internal. If this decay is treated with medicinal remedies and the treatment fails, and you see that the decay advances within the limb without anything deterring it.
It is necessary to cut that limb up to the point where the decay has spread, so that death or a great calamity befalls him instead of losing his limb. A sign that this might happen is when the limb seems to dominate even until you think it was burned by fire.
Or if it whitens after the blackness, until that decay advances to what follows that limb and takes in a group of the body; you should act quickly to cut it off. Similarly, if the cause of decay is due to bites from some parasites such as sea snakes or snakes, or any like that.
If the decay or ulcer is in a finger, cut off the finger and do not let the disease spread to the hand. Similarly, if it spreads into the hand, cut it from the elbow joint, do not let the disease advance until it reaches the arm.
And similarly, if you remove the arm, cut it off at the elbow joint itself, in its natural place; if infection spreads and you observe that the disease has advanced as far as the knee, do not remove the knee simply. There is death involved in such a procedure. Instead apply other treatments according to your capability.
And similarly, if you remove the infection in the toe, cut off the toe up to one of the joints. If it spreads to the forefoot, cut off the foot entirely. If it advances as far as the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
And if the infection has reached above the knee, there is no remedy other than to leave it and let nature take its course to death. The prescription for removing or spreading the disease is to tie a bandage at the bottom of the area you want to cut off, and another bandage above that spot.
And he extends the one who holds the lower band to below, and the other who holds the upper band goes above. He cuts off all the flesh between the two bands with a wide scissors until all the flesh is exposed, then it should be cut or spreaded. It's necessary to put a cotton needle on all sides.
In order not to allow the blade to touch the correct place which can expose the ill additional pain and hot swelling, if bleeding occurs during your work, cover the area quickly or hold it with some clotting agents for blood then proceed to your treatment until you finish.
Then, bandage the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until he heals. I am telling you an example that was shown to me in this specific problem of the limb that I describe for you. It happened that his leg had blackening accompanied by a burn resembling fire.
And that infection was the first thing to occur in his toe, so the man lost all of it when he saw the infection spreading inside him with severe pain and burns only. He cut off at the joint, then he healed.
After a long time had passed, he showed me that decay in his ring finger. Having prepared medical remedies on his hand after cleaning his body, he presented them to me. Despite this, the benefit did not deter and continued seeking in the other finger.
Until the decay reached his hand, he called me to cut off his hand. I begged him, refusing this act of removing that benefit and was also afraid for him when his hand was cut off, because his strength seemed to be collapsing at that time. When he failed in convincing me, he returned to his homeland.
I heard that he cut off his entire hand and became healed. I'm telling this story to serve as a help when something similar happens, and to be a reference or guide for actions to take in such cases.
The eighty-eighth chapter.
In treating abscesses and the method of administering medications to them.
If a tumor occurs in some fleshly organs and the duration of the tumor extends until it has gathered for a long time, then it may burst or explode, and all that was inside from its duration comes out, leaving the place empty as if it were a vase.
The skin on it is like a scratch that has hardened, and was not extensively infected so as to affect the bone or nerve or muscle. That's why it deserves to be called an abscess rather than an ulcer, except if its duration prolongs until the infection affects one of these organs.
Then it is called an ulcer or a sore, and its treatment is to cut all that skin around it like a circle, especially if it has hardened and become like a scratch and you are certain that it does not stick to the place due to its infection.
If you wish for the skin to adhere and it has not reached that extent of decay, there is a thick layer of flesh in the skin, puncture it with the needle. It means you should look at the pus that comes out if it is large and smelly, then medicate it with Egyptian medicine.
The one which is a mix of egg, oil, honey and pepper pieces either combines in a pot and cooks on the fire until the medicine thickens, then take what you need and refine it with water, honey. Then inject it into the pus and tighten its mouth leaving the medicine there for two hours.
Then extract it by pressing. Do this for days until the pus clears and eliminates the bad smell. You might inject with ashes water if you do not have this medicine. It means that you should take tamarisk wood or chestnut wood ashes, and pour water on them.
Then soak it and inject until you ensure that the pus has been washed away. If there is no smell, consider using Egyptian medicine or ashes water. Otherwise, inject with a solution of water and honey in which some powdered pepper was mixed.
Or inject it with honey and wine mixed together, because the honey has cleansing properties and cleanses, while the wine adheres to the pus. Especially if there is a strong ingredient that causes fermentation in the wine and dries it out. After doing this several times and ensuring that the pus no longer decays, you should inject it with what grows from its use for healing.
Like taking nkhly (a type of ointment) and preparing it with myrrh, rose oil, and a strong drink or injecting some of the other medicines and ointments whose qualities we have confirmed in the article on ointments. If the opening of the pus is narrow and doesn't fit the injection tube.
Increase it a little with iron or make a small hole in the Egyptian mercury or the mercury of the Serboians until it widens. Also, if the mouth is also wide, suture its lips together and leave some from it that allows for the syringe to enter without excess.
And if his throat, from which phlegm flows, is elevated upwards, split it at the lowest point where phlegm can flow downwards. For when phlegm gets clogged in the hollow of the recess, it prevents the flesh from growing there.
And if you cannot cut the recess downward as desired, it is recommended to orient the organ so that phlegm can flow from it easily according to what becomes available to you. And there should be no obstruction of anything in phlegm solely.
And as for the mercury salves that are placed on the recess from outside and how to place them, you should take one of the mercurial ointments suitable for what you desire and spread it over a cotton wick. Let the wick be as long as it can cover the entire recess completely. Then, cut with the scissors a hole in front of the recess's mouth slightly larger than the recess's mouth. Then spread some soft ointment on another wick according to the size of the hole and place it on top without touching the mouth of the recess. This helps phlegm to come out freely from there. Do not remove the large wick except after this process.
A few days, as the one on the recess's mouth is the one that you remove every time to let out what has accumulated in phlegm and see if what flows out of the pus is much or little or ripe or not ripe.
And yet, you should also check the location of the recess itself to see if its owner feels pain in it or not and whether there is a tumor or not. If your treatment progresses like this and you observe that only a small amount of material comes out from the mouth of the recess.
Know that if the abscess has stuck together or is about to stick, then on the following day or on the third day, you should open it. And when the wound has healed, replace the puncture with another one and renew the ointment. If a thin pus comes out from the abscess after a long period of time, do not despair over its congealing.
Know that it heals quickly, as some people have slow wound healing in their injuries and others have the opposite. If pus came out from the abscess after many days and it was not ripe, then know that the abscess did not stick together, and if the congealing of the abscess is delayed.
And if it continues for a long time, increase the drying of the medicines. Let them be medicines that are wet in their constitution and dry in their strength, like the nectarous ointment; if more has been added to it, the benefit increases with its addition. And one of the most effective things for treatment is to take the nectarous ointment.
He heals with the application of myrrh and rose, then he sprinkles on it moderately aged wine, then mixes it well and uses it. If you do not have the nectarous ointment mixed with honey until it thickens and is used or take from myrrh and patience and cardamom, crush all together and let it soak in honey while it's still hot, then leave it on the honey. Then it is applied to a puncture, and pressure is applied to the abscess or it is coated with the honey that was cooked until it thickened. Then medicines are placed on top of it, followed by another puncture and pressure application.
And in such cases, he uses the long burr and the root of the Sosnajun cedar. He may use them individually or combine them, crush them, sift out the residue, soak it in the described honey, and then use it. If treating the abscess takes longer than expected with this treatment, know that there is disease within its cavity.
And affected in bones or in other hard nerves or ligaments, the treatment for nail removal has been applied according to what was previously done.
Chapter Ninety-Eight.
In the treatment of the gouty node, splinter removal, cutting off extra fingers and splitting of the fingers' union.
The gouty node is flesh that grows abundantly under the thumb nail or on the foot, and it might grow in other fingers as well. If its condition worsens and treatment is neglected, it inflates and becomes hot.
Or, if the nail grows so much that it eats away at the nail bed, and might consume it completely. It may also extend to the bone resulting in a bad smell and making the finger end broad, with its color turning yellowish. If treated with what we mentioned earlier but your treatment does not work.
You should cut off all the excess growth coming out from the nail using iron scissors, then after that you need to cauterize the wound. It's very useful for cutting in this case, and if the bone is healthy and the nail itself is also healthy.
The nail's concave corner had pushed the flesh inward and caused it to wither and turn black. It is necessary to place a thin pad under the concave part of the nail that pushes back the flesh, lift it up, and gently cut off that affected flesh.
Apply burned medicines to the remaining flesh until it disappears completely, then treat with ointments until it heals. If the decay has affected the bone, you should cut out that bone and remove it, for it will not heal if there remains a rotten bone.
If I see the infection and decay advancing in the finger, cut it off on one of the metacarpal bones as described before, then treat it until it recovers. If the bone is struck or breaks and there's severe pain, it may be necessary to remove the bone fragment first.
Then, cut the bone with a sharp chisel in a zigzag from above downwards. Ensure that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the bone; you will cause severe pain to the bone fragment and it may lead to excess growth of tissue at the site. Then, treat the area with remedies that alleviate the pain.
And as for the extra finger that grows in some people's hands, it might be all flesh. It might also contain bone in some cases and there might be a bone in it. Growth of tissue might occur at the base of a joint in some fingers.
Or, her growth may be in some metacarpals of the finger. There are metacarpals that do not move and those that grow at the joint of the finger might move. If it is purely flesh, cut it easily by removing its root with a wide chisel.
And as for the one that grows at the base of the joint, it's harder to treat; you may bend her rather than cutting. As for the one that grows on one of the metacarpals of the finger, it might be necessary to cut off its flesh first in a straight strip down to the bone and then spread out the bone with one of those tools compatible with this.
Then, treat it until recovery occurs. And as for the adhesion that may occur between some fingers, it happens frequently and comes from what humans produce themselves; when there is a wound or burn and so on, it might be necessary to cut through this adhesion.
Until the fingers return to their natural shape, then place a fletch or perforation in between them with some rose oil so that it doesn't heal quickly and separate between them or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the area heals as desired.
And similarly, if the healing of some fingers on the back of the hand is opened, it should be divided according to what becomes ready and fits with the form of the limb.
The ninety-first chapter.
In cutting the fallopian tubes.
The fallopian tubes are flexible, thick-walled tubular structures filled with black pus that occur in most body parts and more frequently in the legs. Particularly in the femoral artery, popliteal arteries, and the veins, it is advisable to first use a strong purging of the body from the black sweat several times.
Then cut the large artery associated with it, and as for treatment with iron, it is in two stages. One of them is to make a cut and remove the black blood and its appearance, while the other is to sweat and remove it all. With regard to the first stage, the leg is first soaked in hot water pleasantly.
Until the thick, murky blood dissolves. Then lift the leg of the patient from above its thigh to below his knee with a cloth. Then sweat at one point or in two points, or make three wide cuts for it.
Then, with your hand, you should wipe out the black blood from below the leg to above and from above to below until you remove as much of the blood as you consider sufficient or can bear the strength of the patient. Then tie him up and instruct him to avoid foods that produce black sweat, and repeat the expulsion and cutting process.
When the veins are full and it affects the patient, and if he sweats, its appearance would be that of the patient losing a large amount of hair if there was plenty of hair on him. Then he should take a hot bath and his leg will get wet with hot water until it turns red or he could exercise vigorously.
If he does not take a hot bath until the member heats up, then cuts would be made along the length of the skin either at the end near the knee or at the bottom near the heel. Then, the skin would open through the slits and the sweat would come out from every side until it becomes noticeable to touch.
When it appears, you see that it is red and inflamed. When it clears from the skin, you also notice that it looks like a tendon. Then, insert a thread into it until it rises and comes out of the skin, attaching it with a dark, smooth thong. Then, make another cut nearby, about three fingers wide.
Then, slit the skin over the sweat until it appears. Lift it with a thread as you did before and attach it with another smooth thong just like the first one. Then, make another cut or multiple cuts if necessary.
Then, shave it and cut it at the end near the heel of the second cut. Pull it and shave until it comes out from the second cut then pull it to the cut above it. Do this until you pull it from the third cut that is higher than all cuts when everything has come out. Then, cut it.
If it doesn't respond to pulling and shaving, then insert a needle with strong thread into it, tie it, pull it. Then, take the thread under your hand and pull it in every direction until it comes out. Keep it from breaking, if it does break, it will become very difficult for you to shave.
The excerpt instructs that a wick should be placed inside the patient. If it is fully inserted, wool soaked in a mixture of alcohol, oil, and gum should be put at the surgical area. The patient should be treated until complete recovery. Should the vaginal walls be irregular with folds leading to different directions.
And it should not be straight as we said before. When encountering all its folds and points of tension, you must cut through them. Attach the threads to secure them in place so that they can be pulled together evenly when stitching. Exercise caution while cutting; if you damage or sever the wound, it will make the opening more difficult for you. Therefore, hold your effort when making this action.
The image of the wick with which you cut the vaginal wall:.
Image of the blind suture:.
It should not have a covering like other sutures, nor should it be sharp at its tip to avoid cutting the wound and make it firm in bending smoothly because if it is thin, it will tear the wound with its smoothness. Instead, it has an advantage of being thick as we mentioned.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
In the opening of the Egyptian sweat.
This sweat is generated in the legs in hot countries such as Hijaz and Arab countries, and in the hot countries with little perspiration that are fertile. It might be generated in other parts of the body apart from the legs. This sweat arises from an infection that occurs beneath the skin.
This also occurs within living bodies, such as insects and worms, in between the skin and flesh. The sign of this sweat starting is that there would be a very intense irritation on one leg before the area begins to emanate, then the sweat starts to come out from that point of emission.
As if it is a plant or an animal, when its part appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead which weighs from one dirham to two dirhams and fastened, leaving the lead hanging from the limb.
Every time something comes out from it to the outside, wrap it in lead and fasten it. If it lasts for a long time, cut off some of it and wrap the rest; do not cut it off from its origin before all of it has come out, because if you cut it off, it shrinks and enters the flesh, causing inflammation and a bad scar at the site.
For this reason, it should be drained and drawn out little by little until it comes out from the last of it, leaving nothing in the body. In some people, it may come out from this sweat for a length of five spans and ten.
And it has been conveyed to me that a man had sweat coming out of twenty spans. If the treatment for him was interrupted, insert a pin in his hole and press it deeply into the body until all the contents are drained out, then try to cover the area with medicines for days.
Then treat him with tumors treatment, for this sweat may have many branches, especially if it appears in the joint of a leg or within the leg itself. It creates many mouths through which active branches emerge as mentioned earlier in the sections and previously explained.
The second chapter, the ninety-first.
In the crevice of the worm that is generated under the skin and it's called cow's cause.
This disease is called 'cow's cause' in some of our countries because it often affects cows. It's a small single worm that develops between the skin and muscle, traveling throughout the body upwards and downwards.
It becomes evident to the touch from member to member until it penetrates where it has not penetrated in the skin at a point, and exits. It forms from infection among mixtures as is displayed by maggots and life spots of worms in the abdomen.
Only its effects are expected, that if it spreads within the body and rises to the head reaching the eye, perhaps it may open there and come out causing blindness. This happens frequently, so when one wishes to treat her and get rid of her, this is only possible during their eruption upon touch.
You should tie above and below it with a good tying band, then cut her and remove. If she is submerged in the flesh and you can't find her, burn the area where it should be by fire until she burns. The greatest expected harm to the eye as we said will happen.
If you see that it has become in the head near the eye, tie under it on the forehead with a good tight tie, then cut her and remove. It should be agreed upon to cleanse his body with medications that relieve the mixtures of bad germs and beware of food that breeds infection.
The thirty-ninth chapter.
In the cutting for the disease known as nafir.
This disease, which we call nafir in our country, is pain that manifests in some organs, then moves from one organ to another. I have seen it as described to you.
I was called to a woman who had some infection in the desert areas. I uncovered her arm and found a slight puffing beneath the elbow skin when pressing on it, then after an hour, I saw that puffing spreading with the pulse like a worm ascending to its head as quickly as possible like lead.
If it moves from one place to another, the pain leaves that area and settles in the buttocks, then after an hour spreads throughout the body until it reaches the other arm. Then she told me that her whole body rotates like what I saw.
I was astonished by the speed of its transfer from one limb to another, and I had never seen this disease manifest like this before. Except for a group that experiences pain spreading from one member to another, which I've not seen with my own eyes as vividly as in this woman.
I only understood this was due to the woman being from the desert where her body is bare and exposed, which explains the presence of this moving wind. Hence, it wouldn't show in those who are well-fed and have hidden and moist skin.
If you want to treat it and the affected person feels pain, as we have described, it will appear to you clearly. In that case, grasp above and below it with the wheel and cut him until that enclosed wind is released and the place is cleansed.
If you do not see it with your eyes, treat it by bathing the body and what repels winds and disperses them, such as the seeds of the al-qutah plant, snuff-like powders, and similar medications.

Arrows can vary depending on their types and the body parts where they are located. As for their differences based on types, some of them are large and small ones. Some are made from glass that is hollowed out and some are covered with metal. Some have three angles and others have four angles.
Some have tongues and others have fragments, while that which occurs according to the organs it inhabits is divided into two types: either the organs are among the primary hollow organs like the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, stomach and bladder etc. If an arrow hits one of these organs and you begin to notice the signs of death that I will describe later, it should be avoided for extraction. In most cases, removing that arrow would result in the death of the person it injured. If you do not see these bad signs and the arrow is not inside the organ, remove it and treat the wound. As for symptoms of the brain, if an arrow hits it and penetrates through bones causing damage to the membrane covering the brain, one may experience severe headaches, fever, and dizziness.
If you do not see these bad signs and the arrow is not inside the organ, remove it and treat the wound. As for symptoms of the brain, if an arrow hits it and penetrates through bones causing damage to the membrane covering the brain, one may experience severe headaches, fever, and dizziness. Redness in the eyes and the tongue, convulsions, confusion, frequent vomiting; blood may also come out of the nostrils or ears. Speech might be lost along with the voice, and a white moisture resembling dough might flow from the wound which resembles bodily fluids.
If you notice these symptoms, refrain from treating the patient or removing the arrow if it is still inside. As for arrow symptoms affecting the heart, which is near the left breast, you might feel as though it has pierced something solid rather than an empty space.
Maybe the arrow would have a pulse-like movement and black blood would flow from the wound. This might be followed by the limbs relaxing, cold sweat, and chills. Understand that death is inevitable in this case. If an arrow wounds the lung, expect thick, fatty blood to come out of the wound.
The veins around the neck might swell, and the patient's urine changes color. They might also breathe loudly and prefer to inhale cold air. If the arrow hits the diaphragm in the chest, it would be close to the smaller ribs, accompanied by heavy breathing and intense pain.
Surgery is performed, and all parts of the intestines move. If the arrow hits the liver, this leads to severe pain and blood comes out from the wound that resembles liver in its color. If the arrow hits the stomach, it may happen that something not yet digested comes out from the wound along with food.
His condition is clear, if the arrow hit the abdomen and it ignited causing feces to come out from the wound or sore, there's no hope for treatment nor for extracting the arrow. If the arrow hit the bladder and urine started leaking, there's also no hope for recovery.
Something protruded outward and the pain intensified in the patient, realize that he is dying. As for other body parts such as the face, eyes, neck, shoulders, back, ribs, thighs, legs and similar body parts, they have accepted the worst of situations.
If the arrow did not hit a vessel or nerve and was not poisoned, I will inform you about some of what I witnessed concerning these arrows to help your treatment. Specifically, an arrow had struck a man in his eye at the root of his nose.
I removed it for him from the other side under the earlobe, and he was freed without anything unpleasant happening to his eye. I also removed another arrow for a Jew who had been hit in the eyelid under his lower lid by an arrow that had vanished inside him; all that remained of the arrow was its small tip sticking into the wood.
An arrow was large, one of the composite arrows made by the Cossacks with smooth iron that did not have two eyes. The Jew was freed and nothing bad happened to his eye. I also removed another arrow from the neck of a Christian soldier; this arrow was Arabic in origin.
This is the one who has two ears, so he was opened between his cheeks. He had perforated in his navel, so we took care of it until we removed it and he recovered, and then we took out another spear for a man whose spear had hit him in his belly. We estimated that he would die from it.
And when he remained for a time of thirty days or about that, without any change in his condition, we cut into the spear and changed it on him, and removed it. He recovered and no bad event affected him. I saw a man who had a spear hit him in his back; the wound adhered to him.
And when seven years had passed, the spear came out from the root of his leg. I saw a woman who had a spear hit her in her belly; the wound adhered to her and the spear remained, yet nothing changed in her condition or did she find any harm in any of her natural actions.
I saw another man who had a spear hit him in his face; the wound adhered to him and he did not find much pain from it. There are many like this, and I removed a spear for a man who was one of the Sultan's commanders that had hit him in the middle of his nose slightly leaning towards the right side.
The spear completely disappeared. I was summoned to treat it three days after the spear hit, and I found the spear wound very narrow. I searched it with a thin needle but did not feel any pain; he felt threads and pain under his right ear from the slit.
I realized that the threads were from the end of the spear, so I applied a dressing to the area with a strong suction and anticipation for it to swell. I would like for there to be a sign of the spear in the area, so I opened him up again but did not find any event in the area that would indicate the spear had reached the site.
I continued with the dressing for several days and nothing unusual occurred, so it healed within that wound and the patient became miserable from its inability to be removed. Until one day he felt a spear inside his nose, he informed me of this, I then applied the strongest medicine on the wound for many days.
Until it opened and went through him, I felt the fine tip of the spear sticking into the wood. Then I increased opening the wound with that strong medicine until we could clearly see the end of the spear, and it took me a period of time about four months to remove it.
Then, when the wound widened and allowed me to insert forceps into it, they attracted and moved it. But as it didn't respond to coming out, I kept treating it and changed positions on many types of machinery until one day I held onto it with tight forceps, showing the scene described in the last part of this page.
And the physicians would judge that the nasal cartilage cannot be forced; instead, it is healed by its own strength. The wound was closed completely and the patient was freed of any harm at all, permanently cured. I am telling you how some spears were removed to demonstrate this as a standard and example for what I did not mention before.
For the parts of this craft and its detailed specifications are not understood through description, nor is it fully covered by a book; rather, the skilled maker measures with small things against large ones, and acts based on what has been presented to what has been missing. He draws new work and a new machine when facing strange situations.
If I were to descend from this craft, I would say that the arrows only emerge from the organs where they erupted in two ways: either by being pulled from the place where it entered, or from the opposite side, and they come out from where they went in.
Either the arrow sticks in a muscular location, attracting and pulling itself out, if it is not forced to leave from its time of insertion, you should let it be for days until the flesh around it decays making its extraction easier. Similarly, if it appears within bone.
If it is not forced to leave, let it be for days and return to pulling and moving it every day; it will come out. If you cannot force its removal after days, pierce around the arrow from each side in the same bone by a gentle hole until you expand space for the arrow then pull and remove it.
If the arrow, which has appeared within a bone of the head and had penetrated one of the cavities of the brain, and some of those symptoms that I mentioned to you are visible from the wound, restrain yourself from pulling the arrow and leave it until its condition heals after days.
In the process of pulling and removing the arrow, if it is protruding significantly and does not yield to being pulled, then use the holes around the arrow as described for you. Then treat the area until it heals, and otherwise, if the arrow has hidden within a part of the body. And if it has lost sensation, probe it with a spear; if you feel it, pull it using some devices that are suitable for pulling arrows. If you cannot do this due to the narrowness of the wound or because the arrow is deeply in the socket and not close to bone, nerves, or veins.
Cut into it to expand the wound and reach the arrow until you can extract it. If it has two protrusions, hold them and remove all the protruding flesh from every side with whatever trick enables this. In case you cannot remove the protruding flesh in breaking the protrusions and make sure there is no bone, nerve or blood vessel nearby.
And if you try to extract an arrow from any place, use your fingers to touch all directions until you remove it. Be extremely gentle to prevent the arrow from breaking, which would make it more difficult for you to pull and extract it. If you are unable to do this due to lack of time.
Leave it for a few days until the tissues around it decay. Then continue with your operation, as it will become easier by then. If you encounter bleeding, use the remedies described in that section to treat it. Be careful not to cut through veins, nerves or tendons and use tricks if necessary.
You can extract the arrow from all directions, with care, patience and accuracy as I have described. When pulling the arrow out, make sure to maintain its original shape, which was how it was when the arrow hit you; this is more effective.
If you can't do it that way, use whatever method you can. As for the arrow coming out from the opposite side, either something may have protruded outward, or when touching your skin, you might find the tip of the arrow near the top and see it sticking out.
Cut it open and make the cut as wide as your fingers can allow. Then pull it out; it will be easier to exit. If it's stuck in bone, use your hands to twist until the arrow pierces into the bone and widens itself, then pull it out.
And otherwise, leave it for a few days and continue the operation until it comes out. If you find it hard to pull the arrow out, use your hand. If you can't push with your hand because the rod has fallen off, insert the vacuum pump into its shaft to let it enter inside the bird's pipe and then push it through.
If the arrow is hollow, insert a tool that enters the cavity and the arrow will easily come out. If the arrow is poisoned, it would be advisable to remove all the flesh in which the poison is contained if you are able, then treat with what is suitable for this.
If the arrow is in the chest or abdomen or bladder or side and it's close to bodily structures that could be damaged by probing, if you can make an incision, make one and be careful not to cut any veins or nerves, then remove it.
Then suture the wound if it needs suturing, then treat until he heals. Picture of the calivers that attract the arrows:.
Their ends are somewhat like the tube of a bird, made as if it were a chisel when you grasp the arrow or something that isn't left behind. They can be made in different sizes, big, small and medium, each according to the size of the arrow, its smallness, the size of the wound and its narrowness.
Picture of the hollow dart:.
Picture of the poisoned dart:.
This is like the tip of a dart, making it easier to enter and push into the hollow arrow.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
In Chapter One.
The veins that are usually punctured in the body are thirty. There are sixteen of them in the head, two pulsating veins behind the ears known as the Hisseyin and the two veins inside the jaw bones, also known as the two major arteries. The two veins located at the back of the eye sockets are known as the two eyes watchers.
The running blood in the middle of the forehead and the blood in one end of the nose, as well as the two necks that are on the neck and the two blood flows in the upper lip of the mouth. The two blood flows in the lower lip of the mouth; these known blood channels are called ganglions. And the two blood flows under the tongue.
And as for the veins that issue in the arm and hand, they are five veins. One of them is the cephalic vein, which is from the brachial side. People commonly refer to it as the head vein and the lateral canthus vein, which is the central vein. It consists of a branch of basilic vein and a part of the cephalic vein. People generally call it body vein.
And the basilic vein, which is located on the arm side and also called cephalic. It's generally known as the abdominal vein and the arm cord, as it sits on the elbow and is attached to it; it appears prominently above the wrist when seen from behind. And the ulnar vein.
And this is the vein located between the hip bone and the heel bone, having two branches. In the leg and foot there are three veins: one under the tibial crest on the arm side; the second is the calf vein, situated at the heel of the human side; and the third is the ankle vein, found near the backside of the knee on the animal side.
In the other leg there are also three veins like these. As for the two veins behind the ears, their benefit is to relieve chronic colds, fever, and diarrhea, as well as severe recurrent headaches. The method of releasing them will be described according to my description.
It involves shaving the back of the neck and scratching it in the area where veins are located with a coarse sharp tool. Then, strangle the person by wrapping a bandage around their neck until the veins appear. Then look for them behind the ears on both sides from lower areas of the head; you can feel their pulse under your finger. Wherever you feel the pulse beneath your finger is where you will apply the medicine using a brush.
Then take a small scalpel, known as al-nasikh (one that cuts off), then insert it under the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the skin and the cut of skin above until you cut the cut of skin together with the skin in segments, and the length of the cuts is up to two fingers included.
Or in the manner, you send out the amount of blood that you want then pull them (the veins) using the ligatures and leave them until it heals. As mentioned in the first book, there were cutting and tying of these (veins), while the two arteries located in the necks are useful for the treatment of chronic sister's bleeding, hard headache, persistent fever, and excessive eye watering due to sudden intense thirst.
And how to cut them as I describe for you tights the waist of the sick with a cloak until the veins become visible and their pulsation becomes clear under your index finger. Then, get familiarized by using this method and lift the skin above the vein upwards with your pinky finger.
And the tool 'al-nasikh' is inserted from below, lifting the cut of skin upwards and cutting it in the same way as done with other cuts. Blood will be sent out according to your need then you relieve the suffocation of the patient putting your finger on the pulse point for a moment.
Then, place a cotton and ligature on him/her and tighten from above firmly. Leave it until he/she recovers. These methods of recalling, cutting, and blowing were mentioned in the first book. As for bleeding the forehead, its utility is after severing the sphenoid veins which is useful for chronic face conditions like acne, lumps, and pigmented skin lesions.
And as I describe to you, it chokes the patient until the sweat becomes visible. Then you take the machine called the lance and this is its appearance:.
The excerpt provides instructions for performing an incision: "Place the resulting hook of the scissors on the same groove, strike it from above with a pick or something else towards it and leave the blood to flow according to what you desire. Then relieve the suffocation and tighten until he becomes free.
The text describes the use of a wide prying tool, stating that while this might be used, it should not have a sharp edge like other prying tools. Instead, its tip should be slightly broad and rounded to prevent deformation. The reason for these specifications is due to the proximity of bone; if the prying tool were thin and sharp, it could potentially break within the bone during use.
As for the two ducts in the eye sockets, their benefits are to cure diseases like scabies of the eyes, redness and tearing, as well as skin disorders and facial illnesses. As for how one should separate them, it is that you tighten the neck of the patient with a scarf, then separate these ducts while standing above his head. Let the separation be slightly elongated towards length using a small prying tool that's slightly wide.
If there's no flesh in the place, then if the prying tool has a thin edge, it might break. Then you send out your need with blood and put cotton on top of them for one night, then separate them. As for separating nasal ducts, they are useful during severe fevers.
And for severe headaches and other face disorders like the red rash that appears in the nose, especially if it's chronic, here is how to pry it: you should tighten the neck of the patient, then hold their nose with your left hand and take a thin, long prying tool.
And insert it in the middle of the rabbit itself between the nostril walls on straightness because there is no sensation of the duct here, blood flows from its socket, and you should hold your prying tool a little while sending out your need with blood then tie him for one night as he heals quickly.
And if it is about syphilis, its benefit is to separate them because of the tightness in breath and beginning of the disease and black illnesses which appear on the surface of the skin like the black pimple and warts and bad sores and styes, and how to separate them that the pus under them pulls down the neck by a belt, and has the craftsman stand on top of the sick person.
And the ill person is seated on a chair, then perspiration is released horizontally for widening and not too much, then remove as much of moderate blood or according to what you see fit based on necessity. Then do this similarly with the other sweat. And then release the bandage.
And tighten the sweat moderately so that it doesn't suffocate the ill person, and leave him until tomorrow if he heals from his wound, as for sweat glands of scabies, its benefit is to separate them after removing the pimples because it benefits from cavities in the mouth and decay of the gum and bad sores and cracking lips and bad sores.
And it refers to those that are in the nose and around it, how to separate them so that the ill person sits in front of you and tightens their neck with a scarf. Then turn his lips and look at the two sweat glands which you see one on the right side of his lip and the other on its left, distinguishing them by their blackness.
And also, around them are fine black sweat glands that you cut with a small cut. If it looks bad and you don't know what they are, aim for a larger cut and show it to him/her. Similarly, do this in the sweat glands found under the lower lip as well.
And as for the two glands under the tongue, their benefit is to separate them after separating the pimples because of the ulcers that occur in the throat due to disease and mouth diseases. How to separate them involves sitting with the sick person between your hands on a sun shoe raising his/her tongue and looking underneath one side of his/her tongue for sweat gland and the other side as well checking their color till blackness appears.
Divide them and note down, do not dwell on cutting them. For underneath are arteries which might cause bleeding from those arteries. As for the three divisions that occur in the appendix, they have been traditionally cut in all people, and this procedure can be performed in two ways.
Either by piercing with a broad thorn or an olive-shaped oil to the navel, or by cutting with a thin knife, which is the extraction [and this is its image], the image of the broad thorn piercing.
It should be wide as you see to suit the opening of contracted, filled, prominent veins that are visibly thickened with a clot and contain viscous blood like honey. This is the image of the olive-shaped piercing tool:.
This piercing tool is less wide and has a finer tip, suitable for opening narrow veins that contain thin, watery blood. This is the image of the extraction procedure:.
This extraction tool is suitable for cutting, and there are various types that vary in width like leaves or needles depending on the size of the veins. It may also serve as a guide for others, it is well known among craftsmen.
As for the basiliac, which is one of these three veins, its advantage in cutting it lies in drawing blood from the conditions that occur below the neck and around the throat leading to the chest and abdomen. The surgeon should be cautious when cutting it and place their hands on the neck because there is an artery under it; if he makes a mistake and adds to the piercing of the tool, it could lead to cutting that artery.
If there is bleeding, therefore, it should not be opened with a piercing tool but rather by making an incision with the extraction tool. If the basiliac does not show clearly, it should be avoided and another option used or you might ask someone from its community for help.
Or if the cord of the arm is severed, he shows how to expose and open it with a saw as we said. If you want to clamp it in particular, it would be wise before pulling on the arm to mark the position until you recognize the beat location then learn it by touch.
Then attach the arm and make a cut in the skin with a saw, as we said. Ensure that you hit the strike away from the location of the artery. And when you pull on the band and see inflation in the area you learned by touch, then this inflation is due to the dilation of the artery; avoid it.
If you see the blood when cut, shoot like how urine of a boy shoots out and the blood is thin red, then know that it's arterial blood. When this happens, quickly place your finger on it for an hour. Then remove your finger; if the blood stops significantly, often does so, apply pressure to the arm.
Leave it alone, warn the patient not to ignore it and wear it like a necklace and do not move it for days until he recovers. If blood doesn't stop, if you exceed your limit and it disturbs you when you're busy, treat it by pressing the artery if they show up to you; its two ends will constrict and stop the blood flow.
Or take an onion peel, cut it, take one half and pull it tightly on the skin with pressure bandaging and supports until the next day. If blood stops, otherwise treat it according to what was mentioned earlier about placing stopping cords for bleeding. Cutting off its blood is not difficult in most cases.
Knowing the place of small incisions and how to fit the bandage on the arm, if you learn this. As for darker skin, it's beneficial to sever in such a way that draws blood from the head top and body bottom since it consists of a branch from basilic vein and a branch from subclavian as we said.
It is necessary for the amputee to have his stump on a rib from which it was cut; if there is a nerve underneath, and if the surgeon increases the number of stitches through it, an anaesthesia can occur that is hard to see, and perhaps never fully disappears. This nerve is often noticeable by touch.
If it is hidden in some individuals and if it is thin, not being able to be seen, then it would be necessary to make your stump a cut along the bone and avoid hitting the nerve with your effort. If there is sweat between two nerves, then cut the sweat lengthwise. As for fat sweat, the advantage of cutting it lies in its ability to draw blood from the head.
It benefits from eye diseases, and it is necessary in this sweat especially if you wish to expand it; "to expand it" with a pomegranate needle or the wide dill needle, as all veins are purified because there is no artery or nerve underneath.
However, when you are making the cut, it is necessary for you to avoid hitting just the muscle head with the pincers and seek out the soft area. It will not harm him if he is hit in his first blow but may be returned to again several times; however, some people may swell if they are not cut properly in their first attempt.
But the tumor caused by this does not harm him, as for the technique of making the cut and its effects, as well as what should be advanced in its repair, the first thing to know is that the cut either should only be used for preserving health.
Otherwise, it should be used for diseases. The cut that is made in one of the three veins in the elbow, which are fat sweat, black sweat and basilic, should be at the beginning of the spring when signs of congestion appear.
Amputation shall be performed on Sunday or Tuesday, three hours after the passage of the day. As for the amputation used in diseases, it does not have a limited time but whenever need and necessity call for it, whether at night or during the day.
Amputation can be done in every hour and at any time. It should not be performed on children until they reach fourteen years of age, nor on the elderly who have surpassed sixty years. If anyone intends to perform amputation for any reason.
Before amputation, it is necessary to cleanse his bowels with a gentle injection if there is a lot of trapped feces, so that when the intestines are pulled out during amputation, no dirty pus will get into them and cause infection that can harm major organs. It should not be performed on those suffering from obesity, diabetes or dysentery until their condition has improved.
Amputation should also be done avoiding after a meal, vomiting, defecation, excessive sexual activity, fatigue, sports, staying awake and fasting, as well as any matter that could weaken physical or mental health. Then check the coagulation before if the blood is thick.
By the foods, drinks, and medicines if possible, then he should take a bath or indulge in some sports to help his blood clot better. He should also ensure that his amputation takes place during the middle of the day as we mentioned. For him to be free from all kinds of negative psychological symptoms for that day.
As much as one can, he should avoid the worries, anger and fear, and all bodily symptoms such as fatigue, extreme erection, sexual intercourse, etc. He should prepare for his mood with things that are usually used by people according to their customs from kinds of sweetness, perfumes, entertainment, and so forth, each person according to what they can endure.
Then the surgeon sits on a cushion which is higher than the one upon which the patient is lying. He then extends his arm and the surgeon touches him with his hand two or three times, then he tightens the ligature around the arm and moves it back and forth two or three times, ensuring that the pressure is moderate.
For if the pressure is not moderate, either due to over-tightening which prevents blood flow, or due to under-relaxation also preventing blood flow. Therefore, after tightening, it is necessary for the patient to touch all parts of his hands together in pairs.
Until the veins expand and become noticeable through touch. Then, the surgeon rubs the patient's cut with an old olive oil in particular. Next, he places his index finger of his left hand under the vein at the spot where he wants to slightly remove it, so that the vein doesn't move away from its place and avoid hitting it. For there are veins that, when cut, tend to withdraw and some are filled with air. If the patient's incision is made on such a vein, it sinks under the wound after the operation and deceives the surgeon; thus, the patient doesn't bleed from the incision if he does bleed at all, and even then, his bleeding would be narrow.
Therefore, the surgeon should be careful and considerate in all these matters, then he lowers the patient. If the incision was made on the first attempt and if there is bleeding from the vein at that moment, otherwise he repeats it under or slightly above that place with haste if the wound does not swell.
If the wound swells or is painful, leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the ligature, as it may have brought on heat or inflammation. Do not take a bath either. If he wishes to reopen the incision, if the cut was too deep and if blood flow is weak.
Fear that the desired amount of blood does not come out, so reposition the trephine in the same hole and attach it on straightness. Add a little to the opening and do this immediately with the wheel before the affected area swells up; for many people, the affected area tends to swell during the small opening.
If you see it has swelled up, don't hesitate to treat it immediately. Instead, apply something from the bottom of olive oil; it facilitates the flow of blood and is more effective in this position than pure olive oil or other ointments.
Use the bottom of olive oil in all parts for pustules when blood flow is obstructed. This can be done by applying one or both of them on the affected area; if it's thick, the blood will flow and dissolve.
If a large bump occurs in the pustule area, this happens often, especially to those who don't puncture only that time or had a small opening of the skin. Act immediately and place a cloth soaked in warm salty water on the lump; hold it for an hour as it will dissolve.
It should be done after the blood has completely drained from the affected area or another one. If something remains of blackness or green color in the spot for a few days, it doesn't harm; if you want to proceed further, apply some vinegar and dissolved soap on it.
Or something from the extract of fennel and similar substances. Often, a lump and nito (a type of cancer) occur when basileus is punctured; put your hand on it. If you find that it softens upon rubbing, then this nito is bad; be cautious not to apply anything as mentioned.
It may bleed from it, a vein's blood. Gather the bleeding with what's there to harden and make the area dry. Then heal it with all treatments until it heals. For every person, you should drain some blood according to their strength and the predominant color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it bleed until it turns red. Similarly, if it appears thick, allow it to thin out and if it is sharp, until its sharpness goes away. It is necessary for one who is full and strong, needing to expel blood in a single discharge.
Stretch the sweat duct and make the incision broad, while for those who are weak it should be opposite. It is better to remove the sweat in stages and have a narrow hole. The best method of stretching the sweat duct is to create a hollow cut without a notch.
This type of stretching is perfect for bleeding and cutting nerves; it's safe, straightforward, and preferable to the traditional long and wide method. If one is accustomed to this technique during stretching, it would be beneficial to give them a little soaked bread in water mixed with date or blackberry juice before stretching.
If it is broad and he bleeds him in three or four stages, then if his disposition is chilled, before stretching he should take soaked bread in a drink of honey water or in honeyed wine or in good mint tea.
If the overstretching occurs during stretching and its cause is excessive bleeding, it would be necessary to drink meat water and gentle mint tea. He should apply a paste of basil on his chest, using all that we have mentioned in our previous section about overstretching.
The one who is experiencing excessive sweating, and if someone wants to relieve their arm and ease their bleeding again, it would be appropriate for him who had experienced much stretching that his bleeding should be eased little by little according to his strength in consecutive days.
And for those who want to relieve their arm and ease their bleeding again, if they are strong, they should do this seven or nine hours after the first stretching. As for those who wish to attract blood from their body towards the opposite direction it had moved, it would be beneficial for them to rest on the second or third day.
And if someone has a lot of blood in their body that is heated and agitated causing fever, it should be that the blood is expelled all at once from them and a large amount taken out. The opening should be expanded to see if there's a pus after checking all conditions for excision. And place your hand on their pulse with the flow of blood so that death does not occur where there is pus often, this happens if the surgeon is unaware and neglect occurs. It should not be that when you want to remove the arm and relieve the blood again.
And if the sweat gland mouth has closed and it's hard for blood to escape, press or push strongly on it. This is very bad; either leave it until it opens again or use a scalpel to scrape off any hardened blood in the sweat gland opening.
Or apply to it a little salt dissolved in water or a bit of the long-famous vinegar or shakznaia and gently press until blood comes out. If the sweat gland has swollen, leave it alone.
And don't touch it until the swelling subsides. But if necessity requires relieving the blood again, there's no choice; either remove it above this location or do so on the other arm or another sweat gland.
And as for excising the arm cord, it can be instead of the aghool and baslique if they don't exist or are hidden since it's composed of them. The method of its excision is that one immerses his hand in hot water until the needle turns red and the sweat gland appears clearly then pull slightly above it with a moderate tightness using the bandage.
And excise the sweat gland slightly to not be too wide or long, make the opening broad and have your excision above the elbow a little. If blood doesn't come out, place the arm back in the pan with hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until your need is met, if you are in the days of summer, you may refrain from washing with hot water and what makes blood flow more in hot water during winter months. This method of washing is more hygienic than all other methods. For it does not have a dangerous sweat gland or nerve beneath, and as for pinching the elbow crease with the right hand, this is beneficial due to liver ailments. The reason behind doing that pinch is to pull your wrist with the tourniquet or by your hand after dipping it in hot water until the sweat expands.
For it does not have a dangerous sweat gland or nerve beneath, and as for pinching the elbow crease with the right hand, this is beneficial due to liver ailments. The reason behind doing that pinch is to pull your wrist with the tourniquet or by your hand after dipping it in hot water until the sweat expands. The sensation is very clear, then it expands slightly upon a minor distortion. Even if you remove all of it, it won't harm him in any way. Be cautious, don't press the plunger too hard with your hand as there are nerve endings under it and the area is exposed to bone, then return the hand to hot water again.
And let the blood flow in it. If you don't heat it with hot water, the blood will solidify in the mouth of sweat and prevent its flow. Avoid flow until you need to release some blood, then put on sweat a layer of oil and salt so that it doesn't heal quickly.
And similarly, it should be done for every narrow part, and as for the benefit of pinching with the left hand, it is beneficial due to gallbladder issues. Do this in pinching just like you did in the second one, and concerning squeezing (the 'scrotum' in Arabic), its benefit is for diseases that are in the lower body, such as pelvic disorders.
Retention of urine and kidney diseases, chronic sores on the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses, as well as how to pinch by having him step into hot water and carry massage until sweat appears then pull above his ankle joint where it is present towards the thumb.
And from it spreads many branches across the man's face; I elaborate on the widest branch of it or at the ankle in its gathering, which is better and safer. If you open it on the man's face, beware of the nerves beneath it on his face.
And make his amputation as if you intend to cut it off, and have the surgeon remove the stump. If blood does not come out, make him soak in hot water and leave the blood to flow until it finishes draining. If the surgeon incorrectly removes pus during the first attempt.
He should reposition the amputation slightly upwards; since the location is safe and he does not fear danger as long as he avoids the nerve, just like we explained. The same goes for other arms of the body, whether or not it's a man's arm. As for women’s pus, its position is as we described at the elbow on the backside.
The benefit of amputating for a pelvic sore if it's due to hot blood and how to perform the amputation: enter the steam bath, rush in quickly, pull his leg from the hip up to the ankle with four fingers using a thin long glove. Only then will there be no visible scar.
If it appears, amputate him in any condition. Either on the modification which is better and safer or cut off his leg with a scalpel or make an incision. Its position is safe and it's very hidden within most people, so if you can't find it.
If it didn't visibly appear for the senses, amputate some of its branches; these show in the back of the foot near the thigh and wrist. Avoid nerves and let out enough blood as desired.
Then, apply some pressure by placing cotton on the site of amputation and tighten the area. It will heal quickly.
The Sixty-Ninth Chapter Sixth.
In the practice of hijama (bloodletting) and its method of application.
The leeks could be made of the centuries, wood, copper or glass. Hijama (bloodletting) can be done in two ways: one is hijama with a needle and the removal of blood, and the other is hijama without a condition.
And this hijama without a condition has two aspects.
And leeks of the inner ear, both pages of the neck on both sides, and leeks of the jaw under the lower jaw in the mouth. Leeks of the shoulders, leeks on the elbow joints, leeks of the legs, and leeks of the ankles.
And bloodletting draws blood from the capillary channels spread throughout the flesh. For this reason, it should not weaken like severing of an organ and it is not permissible to use bloodletting with or without fire for any disease that results from congestion until the body completely empties itself.
If necessity calls for bloodletting due to a disease or as an act of custom, we would use it at any time in the first month and the last and in the middle of the month and at any given time.
And some people, if there is an excess of blood in them, may need to remove it through bloodletting. They find heaviness and headache on their head. There are others who experience congestion, redness on their face, head and neck. Some find spots on their faces, eyebrows, dark circles under their eyes. And some will feel pain at the site of their leeks.
Among them, there are those who laugh excessively, and among them, there are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth, they spit out their saliva, and blood flows. Among them, there are those who sleep a lot, and among them, they see during their sleep blood, redness, bruising, surgeries, and similar things. Whenever we see anything like that.
And particularly, if it is in the middle third of the month, we were commanded to perform bleeding after passing two or three hours of the day. As for the benefit of bleeding through pricking (najm), it relieves heaviness in the head and water that goes towards the eyes.
However, it should be after exhausting the body's resources. This bleeding can replace the cutting of the vein, and caution is advised for those with cold blood or who have a fever as it can cause them great harm.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly or those with cold conditions in their head; it has led to forgetfulness upon them.
Therefore, it is recommended that the surgeon should lower his hand a little with the incision in order to prevent forgetfulness. As for bleeding in the throat, it replaces cutting of the hyoid bone and the cricoid cartilage.
Therefore, it benefits in bronchitis, tightness of the breath, disfunctioning of the respiratory mechanism, cough and congestion. It is recommended to raise bleeding in the throat slightly as if it goes down, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for bleeding in the axillary veins, it relieves severe headaches in the head, sweatings, redness, congestion and pain at the roots of teeth, it replaces cutting the cricoid cartilage. It is recommended to instruct surgeons not to deepen their hand with the incision so as not to cut a vessel that may cause bleeding.
If bleeding is done under scraping, it relieves the gout in the mouth and deterioration of the gums and similar diseases that occur in the mouth. It can also take the place of piercing on both lips for such diseases. As for bleeding from the shoulder blades, it relieves the pain caused by overloading and heat.
If bleeding is done on the navel of both testicles, it relieves what benefits from piercing those three major veins: basilic, subclavian and cephalic, as it draws blood from all these small veins present in the body. It also draws those smaller veins from even larger ones until the suction reaches to the three large veins.
It is necessary to command the one who performs bleeding not to be too specific about the condition, because the area is free from skin and underneath it are nerves and arteries. As for the one who bleeds on the tonsils, she relieves throat disorders and sores in the mouth.
It is necessary to instruct the one who performs bleeding that she should be large and made of brass, because this area requires a strong blade which might break if made of glass. Moreover, many conditions are set as requirements for it, whereas the ones who bleed legs may reduce the accumulation significantly.
As it draws blood from the entire body, it relieves chronic pain in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, stimulates urination, and helps with boils and pus. It can replace bleeding through the veins of arms or legs, though it greatly weakens the body causing discomfort for many, while bleeding from the tailbone has a similar benefit to leg bleeding.
The method of applying the bleeders is as follows: first, place the one to be bled empty and moisten it moderately with a well-balanced wetness. Do not leave the placement for too long but apply them quickly and remove them quickly so that they accept the blood evenly on the spot without causing unevenness. Keep repeating this process until you see the area turn red and open up.
The appearance of blood, at that moment it is cut and the wound heals slowly then slowly. Then he examines the body's condition, if a person has soft flesh with pores, it should be cut once only lest the wound fester.
The surgeon instructs the one who performs bloodletting to expand the cut slightly, go a little deeper and adjust the puncture point gently and smoothly. If there is thick blood within the blood, it may require two times bleeding. But in the first time, he should make an opening for the flow of thin blood and its removal. In the second time, no need to seek out the extraction of thick blood.
If the blood is very thick, he may repeat the cut a third time to achieve the goal. In general, if we want to remove a little blood, we can be satisfied with one cut. If we wish to drain much blood, we would make the cut deeper. And if we estimate that the blood is thick.
It may be necessary to make a deep cut, the moderate depth of the cut is just beneath the skin. One should not use animal fats when setting dressings, nor water and what cauterization warns against. However, if one's skin is thick, hard, rough with narrow pores.
It may be necessary to apply opening, greasy, and purified ointments on the areas where setting dressings are done. However, if it's summer time, then use saffron oil or tangerine oil or sweet almond oil or sesame seed oil.
If it's winter, then use Narcissus oil, walnut oil, honeybee resin, ginger and so on. If the pus is thick and cold, let the ointment be Myristica oil, myrrh, balm, and spittle and so forth.
If the blemished area has large pores, preventing the skin from healing is advisable. Those with this condition should wash their affected areas after cupping using rose water or cold water, or grapevine juice water, or pear juice water, or water of other similar substances, whereas those whose blood is highly watery.
He should wash the area cupped with vinegar or water of asafoetida and saffron, and so on. However, if his/her skin is thick, he/she should use old wine or water from a well, or decoction of the black seed, or henna, and so forth. It's advisable to avoid cupping in the bathroom after taking a bath.
It is advisable to use it one or two hours after leaving the bath. Also, no one should sleep immediately after cupping. What shouldn't be done by both the person undergoing cupping and the person who has just had surgery before and after the procedure.
You should first consider if the person undergoing cupping or surgery is of a thin and fiery constitution, with predominant heat and inflammation. In this case, cooling treatments such as mint tea, spinach leaves mixed with vinegar, cucumber juice, ghee, etc., are advised. Their diet should consist of fasting, eating goat meat like Scape Goat (a type of goat meat), and dishes containing horse fennel (a kind of herb) among others.
And if their temperament is cold, they should drink honey water or water of rest (a kind of herb) and elderberry water. They should consume medium-aged white wine that lies between the old and new, ordering a diet reduction with mostly fasting food. Their diet should consist of fasting meals like Scape Goat meat, sparrows, pigeons, and quails. Drink more than food during cupping days.
It is advisable that some people, at certain times, should drink of the strong fomentation or use naphtha or shilatha before bloodletting and before breaking one's fast or after it, to strengthen the main organs and improve the blood. However, those who are bled should not drink it.
As for the bleeding that occurs without a condition, it is the bleeding that takes place on the liver, gallbladder, and breasts, as well as on the abdomen, back, and kidney area and right hip. These organs cannot bear the condition during bleeding, rather they are meant to facilitate blood transfer from one organ to another.
As we place the bleeding instrument on the breasts for healing purposes or use it to cool down an organ that was hot in the organ, just as we apply it to the abdomen and back, it agitates the organ, heats it up, and relieves pain from this process. That cold wind is what we use to achieve this effect.
It can be placed on the kidneys if there is a clot or stone in them; by forcefully drawing it, perhaps the obstruction could open up or remove the stone from its place. Similarly, when applied to the liver and gallbladder with a disturbed wind swirling within them, these bleeding procedures are done empty only with a cup.
It can be used with fire and can also be filled with steam in purposes of heat therapy. This is because filling the cupping glass with hot water alone or water that has been boiled with some herbs suitable for this purpose would do so.
Then it is filled and placed on the spot, held for a while and then removed and reapplied as needed. This is an example of how to use the cupping glass with fire:.
Its mouth is shaped to allow two fingers and its depth measures about half a foot. It has, approximately halfway down, a small hole roughly the size of an inserted needle. This cupping glass should be made with Chinese brass or yellow copper having thick edges.
A level surface padded to prevent injury to the organ when placed on it and having a metal object such as copper or iron in its center through which the candle is heated with fire, this caldera may be made larger than what we described and smaller according to the diseases.
And we will use it, as vaginal tampons and the tampons of infants are not for men or camels. As to how this tampon is placed on fire in front of the organ, it involves lighting a wick made of tightly woven cotton or a small candle from cork and placing it at the center of the solid stick within the tampon.
So that the flame rises upwards towards below the tampon, not burning the organ. It is placed on the organ and finger is put at the hole we mentioned so when we hold onto the tampon, there is no need to take out the finger.
So the steam exits through that hole and the tampon dissolves in place, then light the wick according to this method and redo it if necessary. For the tampon used for scabies with water, there is no solid stick or hole in it.
Only fill it with water and place it on the organ only, this is its depiction:
And this tampon, the larger it was to hold much water, the better it would be.
The seventy-ninth chapter of the seventh section.
In commenting on congestion.
Congestion can only be used in most cases on organs where tampons cannot be placed either due to their small size like the gums and tongue, etc., or because the organ is bare of flesh such as fingers, nose, etc.
How to use it refers to the mucus that is found in pure spring water from the contaminants, then it is left for a day and night in the pure water until it thickens so that nothing remains in its cavity. First, the body is evacuated either through vomiting or bloodletting, then the affected member is treated.
Until it reddens, then it is placed on. If it filled up after falling out, the benefit would be greater with rubbing in the affected area using a hot stone if possible. Otherwise, wash the area with soap and then plenty of water, pat dry, and squeeze gently. Should bleeding continue after the mucus falls out and this was a discharge, then soak a cotton wick in cold water.
And place it from above until the discharge stops. If there is much blood, sprinkle some powdered herb or garlic over it or similar items to stop the bleeding, or apply slices of the rubbed eggplant on the affected area.
And leave it until the eggplant sticks in the area, then the bleeding stops. It is necessary that if additional mucus is needed, do not hang this mucus if another can be found. If the mucus does not stick, then cleanse the area with fresh blood.
Or, insert a needle into the area until some blood comes out, then place it. If she feels something from the blood, she sticks to the place. If you want it to fall off, sprinkle some saffron or salt or ashes on her; she will fall off at that place.
The Third Chapter.
In Algebra.
This chapter is also of great importance for what is needed in the practice of medicine, which involves algebraic fractions and the resolution of fractures.
Know ye, my children, that this gate may be claimed by the fools among doctors and laymen, and those who have never looked through an old book or read even a single word from it.
For this reason, this art of knowledge in our country has become extinct; I have never come across a skilled practitioner. And I have only benefited from it what I gained through the long reading of early books and my diligence in understanding them, extracting knowledge from them. Then, I stuck to practice and experience throughout my life.
And in this chapter, I have outlined for you everything that encompasses my knowledge. And I have continued to improve my experience after presenting it to you, distilling it from the excess of elaboration and shortening it as much as possible, making it clear as a statement and illustrating it with numerous images of the various machines used in this field.
This is to increase clarity as I did in the previous two chapters, and there's no power except with God, the Almighty.
The first chapter.
The first section should omit gatherings of matters regarding the breaking of bones and their importance. Before we begin to mention one by one the broken or dislocated parts, it is necessary to discuss in this chapter some general principles and sections. Firstly, you need to understand and grasp the truth behind these matters as well as those who are eager to learn this noble trade, unlike others.
And I say, that if a person experiences a break or dislocation or dismemberment, you should first hurry to correct it, release it or both. If there is no obstacle to prevent it, such as weakness or if something happened with him being young or old, male or female, in summer or winter when the heat or cold was extreme.
Then, his diet is restricted to cold legumes, bird meat and thin soups. He abstains from drinking water, tough meats, food that fills up the stomach, and all foods that fill the veins with blood even if the tumor subsided and you could not expect the substance to accumulate at the site.
Then, the patient should return to his initial management. When breaking bones in setting them, it is necessary for the patient's diet to consist of heavy and sticky foods like lentils, rice, grains, and pieces of meat from beef or mutton. And the eggs, fresh fish, and thick drinks like that are good. Know that broken bones in elderly or strong men cannot naturally rejoin their original condition.
To dry out their bones, and because of their toughness. What was once very soft bone in them resembles that of young children but naturally, it grows on broken bones from all sides like glue with a consistency that sticks to it and tightens until parts stick together.
And connects to itself until it reaches its original strength and durability, as before, so that nothing prevents him from performing his actions.
For this reason, the patient's diet should include foods that are tough, sticky and thick as we explained. Know that fractures can vary according to different body parts since breaking a leg bone is different from breaking a skull or a chest bone which in turn is different from breaking a back bone.
Likewise, all other organs are opposed to each other, and we will discuss each type of fracture in detail under its own chapter, it may vary from another. The type of bone fracture can also differ within itself.
Because it may be a fracture without the occurrence of fragments, and it could be a longitudinal fracture with fragments that are clean or unclean. There can also be a fracture accompanied by wounds and skin breaches, and there is a slight fracture.
For each type, there is a specific trick in correcting it as will be detailed in its place. The nature of bone fracture can be understood through its curvature, bending and the sensation felt when you tap it with your hand.
If there is no apparent curvature, no sensation of twitching when you tap the bone, and no discomfort felt upon touching it with your hand; if the cause for concern is not greatly painful then there is no fracture. Rather, it might be a ligament strain or a slight fracture or a mild concussion. It should not be disturbed by flexion and tapping at all.
But rather carry the medications that will be mentioned later in accordance with what suits it, then pull on it gently. And know that if bone is broken and compressed by two without any fragments occurring, each part has been removed from its owner.
You should promptly correct and adjust it as soon as possible before the occurrence of a hot tumor. If a hot tumor occurs, leave it for days until the hot tumor subsides, then adjust it in any gentle manner you can manage from the means of softness and tricks.
And know that correcting and adjusting a bone without any fragments is easier than one with fragments. Once you understand this, if the bone has fragments, it is necessary to extend the broken limb from both sides whether it's by hand or foot.
Whether with your hands if the member is small, or with two ropes, or combined with a rope and your hand, let the position of your member be on an even level like its natural shape until when the broken part of the bone stretches; then return those excesses to their places by all means you can imagine from trickery and care for every perspective.
And strive that your efforts do not cause the patient pain or distress with what you do. Work to join one bone to its companion in the best manner possible; it is advisable during this time to feel and adjust them with your hand, if there seems anything out of place adjust and set it according to your capability.
And beware of excessive force and strong probing, as many fools do. They often cause damage through their actions; they may burn or temporarily harm the body as you have seen them repeat before.
Then, after settling and mastering it, ensure the member remains still with gentle care. Warn the patient to avoid moving it when awake or asleep, during his state of restlessness or change, upon defecation, and in all its movements. The aim is that none of these actions disturb him, ensuring he finds comfort in the position of the body that relieves pain.
And that is, whenever the patient feels pain or discomfort in its position of rest, he should move it to a different position where he does not feel any pain. He must ensure that this new position is level and straight.
So as to prevent distortion in the body if forced, and as for how you should pull the broken member, it's done just like I've described. Know that broken members vary by their size and shape; some are small, such as arms, fingers, keys etc.
The sutures must be of smooth thread and not abrasive, avoiding the rough parts like the thigh, back, and chest. The sutures should be in parallel straight lines as the broad ligament binds the large body part from every side with equal tension without interfering with each other.
Then, after you have completed the leveling process, you should carry out the corresponding paint job. In a gentle effort at the break site, then you start rolling the bandage at the exact break spot for three or four times depending on what body part it is and gently pull the bandage slightly. Then you take it to the upper side of the break site.
With a pull less than for the broken area, you slightly widen the bandage away from the break site and gradually loosen the tension until you take it in a proper amount from the correct place. Then, you take another strip of cloth to roll it also around the broken area.
Rolls then proceed with the wrap down to the bottom of the break. Make your action in pulling and relaxing as described for the upper first wrap, then place between the wraps a gentle effort or suture according to what corrects the irregularity of the break.
If there are irregularities, do not make anything in them, then apply another strip of cloth on top. Then level off with these tight joints from your hand if the body part does not have any puffing or hot tumor.
If there is puffing or a hot tumor, carry something that calms this tumor and eliminate the puffing, leaving it for days then tighten on it the joints when then, let the joints be made of half bamboo sticks delicately carved with wisdom or make the joints from willow wood.
The material made from cedar or palm fronds or juniper or the like, whatever has been prepared in this way, let each be of this size and shape.
Except that the splint placed on the fracture itself should be slightly wider and thicker than other splints. As for the length of the splint, it is made according to what suits the size of the broken member, picture of the splint:.
Then, you tie the splints with another bandage according to the same level of tension as your first attempt. Then, you secure it from above using tight threads, following what we have mentioned about tension; it should be that the tension on the site of the fracture is greater. As you get further from the fracture, the tension becomes less.
The threads should be of medium thickness and texture; they should be wet camel wool, especially so. If the threads are as thick as what I have seen done by the ignorant people, where they use rolled camel wool strips for their threads; this is a great mistake.
Because it leads to excessive tension with such threads, and the thin threads also are not suitable as you cannot achieve the desired tension with them. Moreover, there should not be less than a finger's width between splints.
If the injured person is harmed by the ends of the splints after tensioning in the right places, place under them soft pressure or spread wool until it does not hurt him at all. As for fractures that come with wounds and occur skin breaches, we will address this separately.
And know that not every broken member should be splinted from the first day, for if the member is large, it should not be placed under splints unless after five days or seven or more, according to your safety in preventing heat swellings.
This is the description of the bandages used to stabilize the initial stages of fractures, dislocations and lacerations. It is a general short bandage that stabilizes fractures and suits most bodily fluids, especially children and women because it doesn't get hot or cold easily.
And this is to take the flour of the coriander seed, which sticks to the walls of the coriander vessel during the movement of the mill and mix it as it is without washing it with the white of the egg, making its mixture neither too thick nor too thin. Then you should spread it.
This is another bandage that stabilizes fractures, dislocations and lacerations. It is made from various materials such as sheep wool, linen, horsehair, hair of the head, protective material; for each of these materials, you need one tenth of a dinar, five dinars worth each if from different sources; 20 dinars worth of silver ash or Roman clay. Everyone uses it and mixes it with silver ash water or egg white if the fluid is clarified. Then this bandage is applied; it has good composition, stabilizes broken bones quickly and suits most people due to its balance.
This is another bandage which also treats fractures and lacerations. It requires protective material, sheep wool, white lime powder; each of these amounts to one tenth of a dinar, five dinars worth for the lime and six dinars worth for coriander in total. 20 dinars are used for the Armenian clay or Roman clay. Everyone uses it smoothly ground, sifts it and mixes it with water or egg white before applying.
This is a recipe for a bandage to soothe and stabilize joints and bones that have moved out of their usual places, to alleviate intense pain and bone dislocation. The treated wool is soaked in vinegar and cooked oil and placed on the affected area. This bandage does not possess a stabilizing force.
But he is excellent in settling the hot tumor and relieving pain, especially. There's a description of another poultice that forces broken bones back into place. It involves taking the leaves of sour grapes and the leaves of desert holly and crushing them all together. They are then applied as two poultices. There's another brief description of another poultice used in cases of fracture.
But if you want to analyze the rest of the tumor, take one precise part each from snuff tobacco root, borage leaves, and rhubarb stalk. Mix them all together thoroughly and apply a paste on it. If the organ is not loose, apply it with mint water or plain water. Then use it accordingly.
There is another, stronger poultice for analysis compared to the first one. It is used when a hard lump occurs during bone fracture. One takes from the snuff tobacco root, caraway seed, coriander and the crown of thorns, and from each component, one part is taken.
All are ground together and mixed with either mint water or pure water or paste, depending on the temperature of the body and the stability of heat. As for olive oil, it was not mentioned in his book to be applied on the broken member when setting it back into place.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil alone, which should be medium between stiffness and smoothness. As for Galen, he thought that applying things containing dry ingredients along with a certain amount of heat such as garlic, honey, and yogurt (similar to what we mentioned) on the broken part when setting it back into place would be beneficial.
A poultice that helps with weakness and pain, it involves taking thyme, mustard seed, human hair or bird feathers, snuff tobacco leaves and salt. All parts are ground together, sieved, mixed well, and then applied as a poultice. As for the amount that should remain on the bandage.
Then he heals, therefore you should examine it: if there is no reason for pain or stiffness and the broken bone does not move from its place, then do not let him stay still for many days. If something serious happened to him in his position like intense stiffness or worrying pain or swelling.
Act promptly to heal him, don't delay that in the least and remove the dressing. Then take a soft cloth or a moistened sea sponge, dip it into slightly warm water and wash the area until the itching subsides and the pain ceases. Then leave the member to rest for an hour.
Then, have him wear the matted wool saturated with vinegar and oil or rose balm, bind it on at night until the hot lump subsides and the swelling of the member disappears and his pain goes away. Then return it to gentle tightening and light pressure bandage without applying as strong a pull in your first attempt.
Continue treating it until it heals. If you notice that the lump, redness, pain and swelling along with all symptoms have completely disappeared, then apply a bandage and tension as before. If nothing of what we mentioned happens to the member, repeat the process as the first one did.
He should not be treated except after three, four, five, or seven days. This period may vary up to twenty days according to the state of the member as we mentioned until the fracture heals and the wound begins to close on itself.
Moreover, increase the tension more than your first effort throughout. Also, increase the hardness of the food for the fracture according to what has been mentioned before. If you see that the break site has dried and become softer than it should, know that the food cannot reach there.
If it boils with boiling water every time and let it cool down once in every three days, and gently reduce the tension. Through this act, food gets delivered to the organ and is cleansed quickly. As for what the ignorant do with stimulants by breaking the organ again, it does not proceed like that.
If they do not stimulate to what should be stimulated and instead stimulate out of frustration, it is an error in their actions and a great deceit. Even if it was correct at some point, it would have been mentioned earlier in their books and practiced that way. And truly, I have not seen any effect from this at all among them. The right thing to do is not to use it,.
Chapter Two.
In the overgrowth fracture in the head.
The types of overgrowth fractures in the head are numerous and their shapes vary, with diverse causes. Some fractures occur due to a sword blow, resulting either in the complete removal of bone down to the small opening beneath the bone or through fissuring at that point where it comes out. Similarly, it is done with wood as the Cordom does.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a Cordom, or it may be that the sword cuts through some of the bone and only removes its surface, not penetrating to the end; this type of fracture is then called a non-penetrating fracture. The injuries from these fractures can either be large or small.
There are fractures that are fragile or flattened, with their cause being a hit with a stone or falling on a stone or something similar. This type of fracture can either perforate close to the membrane beneath the bone or be in the surface of the bone.
The wound of these fractures can also be either large or small, and there is a fracture that remains hidden in the bone within the hair follicle, which is a gradual expansion.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called hairily, and from it, there is a fracture that occurs due to dropping or striking with a stone and the like, which goes into the bone page inside and becomes bent for the location. It's similar to what happens when brass gets hit; part of it goes inside.
It is most common in the wet bone of the head, like that of infants. All these types of fracture may have clean or unclean fragments. We will address the treatment for all this separately, and we will familiarize ourselves with all these types of fractures by examining them.
And inspecting it with probes, removing the rotten flesh from it. As for the hair-like fracture, it is known by examining the bone, rubbing and touching it with a brush; if the fracture appears black. The treatment of fractures first looks at the symptoms of suffocation.
If you see symptoms that clearly indicate fear, such as repetitive vomiting, extension and loss of consciousness, interruption of speech, fever, severe reddening of the eyes and their whites, and other symptoms like these, do not come near or treat the suffocated person; death is likely to occur in most cases when these symptoms are present.
And if you see symptoms that do not threaten and you expect his safety, then take action in treating him. This means that if the injured person was hurt at the very beginning and that was during winter days.
It is necessary to strive in removing the bone before the fourteenth day in any case, and if it's during summer days, it is advisable to quickly remove the bone before the seventh day, so as not to corrupt what is under the bone from the membrane, thus these symptoms which we described will occur.
If the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and is accompanied by a jagged edge, it may be necessary to cut the fractured part that is removed as indicated, which involves shaving off the head of the injured suture.
And when you can expose the bone in whatever way it allows, according to the shape of the wound and what is revealed by the suture, if at exposure of the bone there is a bleeding or a hot lump, respond with what should be done.
And this involves filling the area with a puncture that has been soaked in wine and oil, cleaning the wound until the lump subsides and stops bleeding. Then proceed to repair and extract the bone, which can be done through one of two methods of work.
As for the single method, it is to cut the bone with a fine, narrow sawing stroke, and here is how it looks:.
Then you use another cut after this one, with a slight gap in between. This is how it looks:.
You will also use another cut after the second one, with a slight gap from it. It is essential for you to have several different cuts; some of them should be wider than others and some should be shorter than others. They should all have extreme sharpness, and they should be made of Indian iron or good steel.
Use care when striking the cut to avoid disturbing the head and causing injury. If the bone is strong and hard, it may be necessary to pierce around it before using your cutting tools as you designated them 'ungrooved' tools, but they are actually called 'ungrooved'.
Because they do not exceed the limit of the skull bone to beyond it, in order for the tool to have a smoothly extended edge below his head that resembles a necklace or small circle, preventing it from sinking and going beyond the thickness of the bone.
You should take several of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone until you have one drilled skull with a pointed end in length and shortness according to the thickness of that skull, and this is a picture of three types. From the drills, large, medium, and small:.
As for drilling around the broken bone, you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you realize that the bone has punctured. Then move the drill to another location and after each hole, make a certain thickness or as close to it between every incision.
Then cut with the cuts between each two holes and do this as much delicately as you can manage, as we said, until you remove the bone either by hand or by something else from some of the tools you have prepared for that.
Like the saw and gentle pruners, you should be extremely careful that the drill or cut does not touch anything in the skin. If you raise the bone and it is free from the skin and you take it out, you should cleanse.
And you smooth the roughness that remains in the bone with another tool resembling a cut, except it should be finer and gentler than other cuts. If there's still some small bones and fragments left, take them gently with the tools at your disposal.
Then, treat the wound afterwards with the remedies mentioned by Galen and others, including ligaments and ointments. As for the other side of this work is simplicity far from complications, as Galen noted and praised greatly; this is what he said. You should first start by uncovering a part of the bone from the location where it was broken most intensely and for longer. Until you expose that portion, you make under this end of this magnifying glass tool and here is its picture:.
The convex part of it is smooth and does not cut anything, while the sharp part of it on its sides goes along the length as you see. The convex part should be supported by the cornea and the face of the sharp part in the bone. Then hit the cut from one side only.
With a small mallet, until it cuts all the bone gently as it rotates, and you are safe from the membrane where nothing frightening can happen. Even if the surgeon is ignorant of people and too cowardly, yes, even if he is negligent.
If there is something left that is attached to the bone in some parts of the bone, scrape it off with the tip of the convex cut itself and remove it gently, for it will get rid of it without harm or fear.
And if the bone fracture did not reach the membrane, and what was cut from the bone faced it, leaving roughness and small pieces in it, it would be advisable to remove that roughness and take out those fragments with gentle blades. These blades have taken various sizes according to several purposes which you can use in every place as long as they suit your needs due to their flexibility and adaptability based on the requirement of work.
And the broken bone and its shape should be used first in scraping it, then use a finer one after that. Continue doing this with loyalty until you become proficient with all of your finest and most delicate blades.
And as for the smaller, hair-like incisions and gentle breaks, it would be advisable to use a treatment for each one according to what leads to improvement, which is something that any person with even the least knowledge in this trade will understand. And take note of what we wrote and explained about the larger fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after bone extraction, it is recommended to take a goat's hair thread according to the wound size and soak it in resins oil. Then place it into the mouth of the wound. Afterwards, you should take another hair thread that could be curved or triangular. And soak it in a drink, oil, and resins, then place it on the first hair thread. Do this with as light as you can manage to avoid weighing down the wound. Then apply it from above with a wide bandage, pull it only enough to just hold the wound.
Let it undergo this treatment for one or two days until the hot tumor calms down, then remove it and after that use the medicines she has prepared, such as powders of saffron roots and coriander seeds, powder of cardamom and zedoary root, etc. Do this by making a paste from these medicines.
Apply it to the wound when it's dry, in short, use a medicine that tends to cleanse without pleasing. Strive to ensure your treatment of the wound is clean, free from the greasiness or stickiness of oil, and don't let pus accumulate there.
Because pus, if it accumulates on the brain membrane, deteriorates and contaminates it, causing significant damage. It can also lead to severe complications in the case of a bald spot on the head when the bone is exposed. Especially if one neglects its treatment.
A black spot on its surface, if you inspect it, reveals the symptoms we mentioned. Therefore, know that he is dying without a doubt; however, if the blackness only occurred due to the medication placed on it and was an effect of that medicine's strength.
You should take a part of honey and three parts of the oil of rose, mix them well and smear them on a hair thread. Then place it on the wound then treat him with various types of treatment until he heals.
Chapter Three.
In setting the broken nose.
Know that the nose breaks only its upper slit, either both or one of them, because they are bones. The lower part is cartilaginous and does not break but is subjected to swelling, bending, and displacement.
If one of its slits breaks, it is necessary to insert the little finger into the nasal aperture and from inside with your ring finger and thumb outside until the nose returns to its natural shape. Do this gently and be careful not to cause harm or pain to the patient.
If the break is in the upper part of the nose and the finger did not reach there, you should smooth it out with a hard but somewhat soft tip. If the break is in both parts, do the same, and it should set on the first day after the break occurs.
If possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling has subsided, then enter into the nasal aperture a thread of silk incision if the break is in one part or two threads if the break is in both parts.
Let the thread be as hard as it fills the nasal aperture, and some of those who set bones mentioned that one should grease the thread with tallow and change it every day. However, I do not see this practice; instead, it is necessary to grease the thread with raw beaten egg mixed with walnut powder.
Then leave the thread until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens. The nasal aperture may become lined with a feather tube of the owl after applying a soft incision, making it harder to pull out because it prevents obstruction of breathing if the patient is unable to breathe properly.
This is not necessarily something you must do if you choose to create it, and if you choose to create hair tips, when the nose is exposed during your work and a hot ember falls on it, you should cover the nose with cotton dipped in honey and oil or with something from deodorant ointments.
If there is no hot ember, it would be appropriate to dust the affected area with flour and ground saffron, which has been mixed with the white of an egg. Then place a soft cloth on it, do not bind the nose in any way at all. If the nasal bones break slightly, they will break into small fragments.
Or if it disintegrated, you should cut into it and remove the fragments with a suitable instrument, then suture the wound and treat it with things that promote healing and relief from the ointments compatible with this. If there is an injury inside the nose, it may need to be treated with cauterization, and lead pipes are used. Until it heals.
The Fourth Chapter.
If the lower jaw breaks, it must be corrected.
If the lower jaw breaks and it's only a fracture from outside without any internal breakage, identifying it becomes easier.
If it's a fracture in the right side of the wound, you should insert the left index finger into the patient's mouth. Similarly, if the break is in the left side of the wound, you use the right index finger and gently lift the fractured piece from inside to outside.
And the other hand controls from outside the bone to adjust it. If the jaw fracture occurred in two pieces, it may be necessary to use rods on both sides until it is adjusted. If there was growth of teeth involved, it would indicate a more complex situation requiring professional intervention.
Or it might be separated by a knot that you desired to remain with a golden or silver or ivory thread, then place the broken hair ghee on it, and put an inverted needle on it. Then put a large tight button or a leather shoe sole equal in length to the hair. Then, fix it from above according to whatever you decide for its binding and makes it fit until it doesn't break. Command the patient to rest and not move around and make him eat伊拉克's soft food. If you suspect that he has changed something in his appearance on one of his faces by the third day, address his treatment immediately.
Then, fix it from above according to whatever you decide for its binding and makes it fit until it doesn't break. Command the patient to rest and not move around and make him eat伊拉克's soft food. If you suspect that he has changed something in his appearance on one of his faces by the third day, address his treatment immediately. Then, repair the ghee bandage that you applied with the white of egg or wheat flour after removing the hair ghee from it. Put a soft thread on the bandage. As long as this bandage sticks to him and his condition for bone doesn't change, leave it.
Don't resolve it until he is healed and the fracture becomes stronger. This fracture often strengthens after three weeks, if a hot lump appears during this period, use what we have mentioned repeatedly in calming it until that lump goes away.
And if it is a fracture with an injury, observe. If the bone has healed completely or partially from the injury, gently remove those fragments according to how you can take them off with the machine. If the wound's mouth is narrow, widen it with forceps to the extent of your need.
Then, if you have removed all those fragments, suture the wound's mouth if it is wide. Otherwise, apply one of the ointments that suits this. The wound heals until it is healed,
The fifth chapter.
In setting fractures when they have broken.
Most often, the femur fractures near its knee end. When it breaks, it does so on one of three aspects; either it splits into two without forming fragments, which is easier to set; or it breaks and forms two fragments without splitting, or it breaks into multiple fragments, none of which split further.
Alternatively, when the fracture produces fragments, it is more difficult to set. Or, if there is a wound along with the fracture, work on it as if it was a fracture without injury: you should have two assistants; one of them holds the broken part of the femur and the other extends the neck towards the opposite side.
Then, straighten the fracture with your fingers until its shape conforms to what is required; there should be neither a gap nor any displacement. Should you need more extension, it would be advisable to place under the patient's wrist a ball made of coarse cloth or wool.
Its size should depend on your need. Extend the femur and lift it up, press the ball with your hand until the fracture is correctly aligned. If you're unable to pull out the end of the femur because it has gone deep, the patient should lie on his chest.
A medium-sized cushion is placed under his knee. The assistant presses the knee downwards until the femur in the deeper location rises above, then you can correct and align the fracture with your fingers when it's in the right position.
If you feel that a fragment of the femur has broken and it's moving, it should be cut through gently until you can remove that fragment. If the fragment is trapped in the bone, try to sever it along one of the cuts prepared for this purpose. After making the machine that preserves the eye, which is made of wood or iron, and here is its appearance:.
It resembles a spoon without a handle, and its width is according to the size of the bone you need whether big or small. As for its length, it should be according to your capability for work too, being two-edged as seen, where one end is wider and the other narrower.
If the wound cut when removing a bone fragment is wide and you've made sure that there's no infection, sew up the edges of the cut. If the cut was small or if you're worried about an infection, widen the incision by cutting across and adding sutures according to how deep the cut goes.
If the hot tumor is in contact with it, apply the ointment made of rose water and vinegar or wine on it. As for breaking bones without injury or cuts, take the pad prepared from the dust of chalk mixed with the white part of the egg and place it on the bone. Then place a soft bundle on top, then place the ball under his ribs if necessary. Then take an overcoat that is very long and its width should be about one hand or slightly more. Then carry a bent rod over the bandage and padding. Then take a hammer from a thin board. Its width should be about three fingers, and so in length as well. Then insert it into the opening (or incision). Then place that incision together with the hammer inside the cloak where it falls over the breakage site. Then pull the cloak onto the breakage just like you would rotate something. Place the bandage around his neck and under his ribs on his chest, as well as under the patient's ribs. Have it move back and forth several times in each direction according to what I've shown you; the adjustment of the break should be precise and firm, which is evident to you.
Every principle is that the kidney should not be removed from the broken bone. Therefore, you should examine the sick every day. Whenever relaxation of the ligament causes disappearance of the kidney, correct that and tighten the ligament again. Then make the sick lie on his back to sleep at night, and place a small cushion under his elbows while he sleeps.
Let his arm rise from his side, causing the broken collarbone to lift by the height of the elbow or by tying his arm to his neck. Do not loosen the bandage if there is no occurrence of a cut or tumor at the spot for twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see any indication for it. It is recommended to tighten the bandage and leave it until he forces himself, causing the broken collarbone to mend. It becomes stronger and more stable over time; this typically takes about eight weeks. It may happen in some individuals in less time.
The Sixth Chapter.
In forcing the shoulder fracture. Breaks occur in the broader area of the shoulder blade, and only its edges break away. When a part breaks off or it cracks in the middle, this is known by touch. Depending on what shape the break has, apply according to that.
Fixing it, return to its natural form on each side of the trick you can use. Then carry over sand from the furnace with the whiteness of egg whites and soft flour. Place a roll under the break. Put a wide kidney above it.
Cover the shoulder blade as evenly as possible or slightly wider. If it is under the kidney, spread the indentation in various parts of the shoulder until the kidney settles evenly, then tighten from above with a long veil.
Tightly tighten and firmly secure the ligament until it does not move from its place, inspect the bandage every day. Whenever the bandage relaxes, tighten it again and adjust the ligament if it moved from its place. Have the patient lie on his correct side, with his elbow resting in a groove.
One day or twenty-five days. When this period has been completed, the bandage can be removed and you are safe. The bones in this area do not fear fracture or loss of substance. If a fragment emerges from the bone that is still under the skin, cut it open and remove it. Perform what was mentioned regarding breaking the tension in the hot tumor if something of that sort occurs.
Chapter Seven.
Infracting the breastbone.
The breastbone may break in the middle of it, and this is relatively rare. However, its ends are more prone to fracture and dislocation. One of its symptoms when the middle breaks is that it tilts downwards, exposing intense pain and difficulty breathing, along with coughing.
Or perhaps blood flows from the wound and bleeding is evident in the bones of the broken bone, which cannot be concealed to the touch. After this, the patient should lie on his back with a pillow between his elbows. Then, the legs are bent and gathered by hands from both sides; he should then be gently adjusted into its position in every possible way.
And let him agree until the shape of the bone returns to what should be, then place a bandage and pressure on him, placing on top of it a ligament made from a friend's plate of copper or similar material in lightness after wrapping it around a winding. Then carefully attach it to the broken bone so that it does not come off. Pass the bandage around several times towards the back, pulling tightly and firmly each time. Then check the bandage at every moment; whenever it relaxes, tighten it.
And if necessity demands its resolution when the wound is open, or causes pain or a lump, proceed with its resolution and remove the bandage. Fix whatever has appeared through this means of treatment then return the bandage if I see fit. And apply it to the head and tighten it until it heals,
The eighth chapter.
In the case of bending or breaking the ribs, know that the break occurs in the most painful areas behind and around them from the front. It's due to their being cartilaginous. This is evident upon palpation by touch as there will be sensitivity at these points.
To set the broken bones, apply pressure with your fingers on the appropriate face until it becomes as it should. Then dress and immobilize the broken bone with a splint if needed. If the break in the ribs is tilted inward, it is exposed to the reason for pain and severe discomfort.
And the bone resorption is like that which occurs in those with a wound because the bone reabsorbs the scab and also causes difficulty breathing, coughing, and abundant bleeding. This makes treatment difficult; various tricks were tried initially to address it successfully.
Some say that the food for someone suffering from resorption should stimulate breathing and circulation so that their belly inflates, expands, and pushes outward the break. We dislike this because it might confirm the occurrence of a hot tumor if there was none; but if one already occurred, it would worsen and affirm its presence.
They say some would place something inflated on the spot, then suction with force; it is similar to measurement except that he fears it might be sucked into the spot due to its weakness. Others say it should be covered with cloth dipped in hot oil.
And it becomes a supplement between the vertebrae until it fills, then if you twist it into place, it will be level. Then treat the deficiency with remedies for food and medicine; if causing the deficiency is severe, one cannot endure it. The bone would wither the sheath, causing it to shrink and alarm us about the deficiency. It is necessary that we cut into the place and expose the broken side; then put an instrument under it which holds up the chest wall as described and carefully cut the bone out.
Then, if it is a large wound, we stitch the edges together and dress it with ointments until it heals. If there is a redness during this process, start applying soothing preparations of rose water over the area and treat any inflammation both internally and externally.
He should sleep on the side that feels the pressure until it heals, or until recovery occurs.
The Ninth Chapter.
In relieving the pain in the back and neck.
As for the neck bones, if they break and it is rare that this happens to them and more common that it occurs during pregnancy as well as the spine also, when this happens to someone and you want to know whether they will recover or not. Check them, if you see that his hands have relaxed and gone numb, they are dead, he cannot move or spread or grip them, when you twist or pinch them with an iron tool he does not feel it nor finds any pain in them. If this is the case, know that he will not recover most of the time, he is dead.
And if he moves them and feels their texture through the spinal discs and ligaments, know that the spinal canal has been cleared and the disease can be cured. If a case of back pain like this occurs, and you want to determine whether it will heal as well.
And look at his legs, if you see that they have relaxed and the same thing happened to them as in the hands. Then when he lies on his back, gas and feces come out without effort. And when he lies on his stomach, urine comes out without effort. And if he wants to urinate when lying on his back, but cannot do so. Then know that he is dying and don't concern yourself with treating him. If he has not shown anything similar before, the situation is less severe. And for treatment of what happened, you should try to calm down the hot tumor.
You should apply vaseline alone or with cooked chicken pieces on the affected area. Apply this three times a day until the hot tumor calms down. Then, carry over to the place one of the moistening absorbent pads and tighten it with the bandage while commanding him to stay still and make decisions.
And he should not sleep except on the side that does not give him pain until he heals. If there was a shard or something that healed in the bone during breastfeeding, it is advisable to cut through the skin and extract that bone. Then gather the edges of the wound if it is large with stitching. Then treat with ointments until he heals. If the last rib breaks and it is atrophied, it may be necessary to insert the thumb from the left hand into the socket.
And break the broken bone with the other hand according to what allows and achieves alignment. Then apply a bandage and plaster if needed, then secure it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, split it and extract it, then treat the wound with the previous treatments until it heals.
The tenth chapter.
Inforcing the fracture of the thigh bone.
If the pelvic bones break, if they do break, it is a fracture where they shatter at their ends and split longitudinally, tilting towards the inside. This exposes them to weakness and pain in the affected area. The injured leg may become numb or feel numbed due to the fracture from that side.
And to force it by placing your hand on the fracture until you stand upon its nature as it is. If the break is only at its ends, then align that break according to what suits you for alignment, until it resembles its natural shape.
If the break is in length or if it has tilted inward, put the weakness on its back so that you can align this break. After aligning it, place the bandage on it, then place a support of wood or skin over it and pull it tightly.
Do not fear the movement of the break or the removal of the support, adjust the tightening to fill the gap in between so that it can hold its place when you ask the weakness to sleep on their back or correct side, if they are exposed to a hot lump.
Release the pressure and forcing it until the hot lump subsides, then place on it what you have placed before. Then return to the forcing and tightening as it should be done. If there are fragments or fragmentation in the bone at any point, it is not advisable to remove them.
And do not touch it, rather align it from the outside as we said, and leave the tension until it heals.
The eleventh chapter.
In the lever principle for breaking the forearm.
The elbow is the area between the upper arm and the shoulder. If it breaks, it can be broken using two methods; one of which involves taking a firm smooth curved stick at this angle: .
And tie it at both ends with ropes, then hang it from a high place. The injured person sits on a chair. Then lay the broken arm over the stick until his elbow sticks in the middle of the curvature of the stick. Then hang something heavy from above him.
Or have the servant extend it downwards, then together, the doctor adjusts the break with his hands until the break returns to where it should. The other method is for the injured person to lie on their head and tie their hand behind their neck with a rope.
Then, command the servants that one of them adjusts what is above the break with his hands and the other adjusts what is below. Each servant extends their hand to their side. And if you want the extension to be stronger, tie a rope under and above the break and each servant extends their hand to their own side.
If the break is near the knee, it would be advisable that one of the loops of the rope be under the elbow and the other under the break towards the upper arm. Similarly, if the break is near the upper arm, it would be advisable to place the loop in that position and on the upper arm itself.
Then, adjust the break gently without force until the break settles in the right position and adheres properly. If it doesn't show improvement after a day and there's a hot lump, leave off exerting pressure until the seventh day. Then place it on a poultice soaked with vinegar and apply rose water oil to it.
Even if the tumor is located, in that case pull it, the prescription for pulling is to hold the bandage on the fracture then wrap a new bandage over the bandage. Then gather the arm onto itself and place her hand open on her buttocks.
And hold the cut and the pulling on the elbow and arm, to make the arm take the place of the joints if it is not prevented from that by an obstacle or does not change anything in the broken bone. If you fear that something will change with you, use the joints.
And place on the fracture itself a joint that is wider and stronger than the rest of the joints. Make an interval of one finger between each joint, and let the length of the joints be according to the fracture by adding three fingers from each side.
Then pull on the joint as you mentioned in the initial section of this chapter.
And it is that your pull on the place of the fracture should be stronger.
And as the distance from the fracture increases, if you see placing of the joints and pull as we mentioned when you were trying to restore your limb through your own efforts, then do it.
And if you fear the hot tumor, leave the pull and joints up to the seventh day as we said. Then check the bandage every three days so that no abrasion or swelling occurs in the area, or food is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive pulling. All of this should be done according to what we have mentioned.
If you are confident that none of these will happen, don't release the bandage until many days later. The patient should lie on his back and put his hand on his stomach, with a cushion placed under his elbow filled with wool, properly filled.
Inspect at all times of the day or night so that the shape of the broken member does not change or the ligament relaxes. Repairing all this requires your effort, and make the food for the fasting person be in the rank we provided that it should be gentle first until the bone wants to strengthen.
You should thicken his food, for it is common that the arm and leg strengthen in forty days then it should be alleviated and start using baths and treat with ointments suitable for this. If the breakage is excessive, it must be treated satisfactorily.
Don't relieve him of the ligament until fifty days or two months.
The second chapter.
In restoring the break of the arm.
The arm is made of two bones and it's called the zygos (joint) where one is smaller, named little finger joint, which goes under the thumb. The other one is bigger, located underneath the smaller bone from below. It may break alone, either the large one or the small one, or they might break together.
If the small finger joint at the top broke, the repair would be easier and it could be seen faster. If the lower zygos was broken, the break was bad, hard to see, and even worse if both bones broke together. If the bone that broke was the smaller one above.
When performing the restoration, the doctor should make it easy and gentle for him until he heals. If it's the larger zygos that is broken, it should be made harder. And if both zygoses are broken, the treatment should be extremely stronger.
It is necessary that the shape of the hand during a procedure be placed such that it is extended on a cushion and the thumb of the hand be above all the fingers. The wrist should be lower than all the fingers, and the little finger should be seated stably upon itself.
Let the cushion be at his height so that the elbow does not have to bear the burden of the arm.
Then, he extends the arm assistant from below either with his hand or with a strap and another assistant extends it from above in the same manner. Then, the surgeon adjusts the bone until he can return it to its best possible form; if there are fragments of the bone in a break, they should be removed.
Return every fragment to its place; if there is a clear fragment where it belongs and the skin is shrinking without desire for correction, cut and extract it in the manner we mentioned earlier. If there is a fracture with a wound, you should have a separate section for it.
You take care of its treatment from there. If you see a hot tumor in the first operation, apply a puncture with a needle dipped in rose oil and white beeswax, making it of medium thickness between thickening and thinning. Gently tie on the puncture until the tumor subsides.
Remove the needle and place the prepared bandage from the rhubarb dust mixed with egg white. Then carry out the clamps, making sure that the clamp placed on the fracture itself is slightly wider and stronger. Know that there will usually be seven clamps for an arm.
If the fracture is in one bone or both bones together, make your traction on the place of the break stronger and tighter. As you pull up or down with the traction, let it slightly curve according to what was mentioned earlier in the first section.
Let the wound that forms around the fracture be moist and soft, not too hard. Use a cord made specifically from sheep's wool, medium in size between tenderness and hardness, as we described. Examine the member and ligament after several days.
If something occurs that requires fixing like a scrape on the member, it should be rinsed with hot water until the scrape subsides and leaves the member not stretched for a night so it can rest. Afterwards, it should resume stretching.
If the stretching has relaxed and the bone has moved or something like that, fix everything based on your judgment, and also observe if food is unable to reach the member due to excessive stretching. In such a case, slightly relax it and leave it for some days until food can flow towards it, then resume stretching.
If nothing arises from the reasons we've mentioned, it should not be released until after twenty days or around that time. Then have the person hold their hand to their neck, let their arm be at a moderate angle, and restrain their effort from chaotic movements. Have them sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture of the arm is bound for thirty days or twenty-eight, and perhaps it binds for twenty-eight days; all this depends on the conditions of humors and strength.
The thirteenth chapter.
In the correction of a wrist and fingers fracture.
Rarely does a wrist or finger fracture involve the comb and joint ligaments; rather, it involves the hand significantly. Whenever there is a fracture in the wrist or hand.
It is necessary that the patient should sit upright and in front of a stool on level ground.
Then, he places his hand on it stretched out. Then, the attendant extends the broken bone and adjusts it until it is properly aligned. When it has been aligned well, then the bandage and effort are applied unless a hot lump occurs. Afterwards, a poultice is placed from above according to the position of the injury.
And it has been included in a gentle tie. If the break is downwards towards the underside of the hand, then make a half sphere from the gauze and ask the patient to hold it with his broken hand, then pull with a long strip of gauze.
Let the poultice be made of skin with a soft texture, so that the skin fits along with the curvature of the entire hand and is tightened as needed. If the break is outward, then the poultice should be placed above and another one below in the palm of the hand to keep the hand open upright.
Then, he applies the tension as if the hand is turning and binds between the fingers with a bandage. If the break is for one of the little finger joints, then it should be adjusted accordingly. Then he tightens with the palm if you want to keep him standing with a small poultice to set the break.
And he doesn't move. If the break is for all other fingers, like the middle finger or ring finger, or wrist or carpal bone, then it should be adjusted and bound correctly with the following correct finger, or all of them with loyalty binding - this is better - or place a small standing poultice on it.
As we said for the thumb, and check during the immobilization and away from the hot lump, match with what is necessary whenever something of this kind repeats, as described.
The Fourteenth Chapter
In applying leverage to fracture the thigh bone.
The thigh bone breaks often due to its sensitivity to touch, as it moves forward and backward. To leverage this fracture, one should pull a band above the break and another below it; the patient is lying on his face.
Then each assistant grips his band according to the balance needed, if the fracture is in the center of the bone. If it's close to the thigh's root, it would be advisable to use a softer band like wool or something similar for securing it.
At the thigh's root towards the knee, the pull should be upwards and the other band below the fracture. If the break is near the knee, the band should also be placed near the knee but downwards. Then, with both hands, the doctor smooths out the bone until it returns to its natural shape.
The bone heals well. In that case, you should apply the bandage and exert pressure unless there's a hot swelling in the member. If there is a hot swelling, leave it for some days until the heat subsides before returning to its treatment.
As for the pressure, it should be applied with a hard and wide band multiple times - either twice or three times. Whatever is left over from this should stay on place. Then apply the leg until the heel aligns at the root of the shaft. Insert a long thread between thigh and leg near the knee's bottom. Make sure the ends of the thread will be above from both sides.
Then roll the remaining bandage on the leg and thigh. Place splints at the location of the break for the thigh bone, making it one splint over the femur bone. Then fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft padding to ensure an even tension.
Then start by pulling the strongest strands from the center on the fracture site for three or four turns. And each time you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, make your pull less, softer and smoother.
Then, proceed to the end of the thread you inserted between the thigh and leg. Tie onto what follows from the bones above. Then pass both ends of the thread downwards until it reaches the ankle. Securely pull the other ends of the bones as well.
So that the bandage does not move from its place, leave a tight pull on it as long as no complaint is expressed by the member or lump or swelling and such. If any of these occur, take action immediately to address them and correct everything that has happened in accordance with what we have repeatedly mentioned.
If there is a piece of bone that fractures inside and diminishes, it should be smoothed out if possible. If not, break it and remove it. Then treat the wound as previously described until it heals. This may reduce the fracture in the thigh without adding to it by connecting with bones in the leg.
As we mentioned in the back and arm, except that forcing him like this does not allow for recovery or regrowth. If she is forced alone without adding to her with the leg, it will necessarily prevent the owner from ever recovering.
And know that the thigh will strengthen in fifty days or a bit more or less, all of this depending on the variety of conditions and other circumstances.
The fifteenth chapter.
In the case of breaking the kneecap.
Kneecap fractures are rare, but it is common for patellar tendons to rupture during a fracture. If the kneecap breaks, it could either be due to a split or fragmentation within its parts, and this can happen with or without injury.
The entire process is performed by touch, and strength is exerted to unify what separates its parts with the fingers until it comes together and adheres as much as possible according to the ability for unification and care and skill. Then a bandage is applied and if necessary, a winding stick is held on top of it.
You should pull from above as per the corresponding tension, and then all conditions described in various fractures such as the hot tumor and similar ones must be considered; each should face what suits it until recovery.
The sixteenth chapter.
In the treatment of correcting a broken leg.
The thigh bone has two: one is thick and it's called the femur, and the other is thin and it's called the patella. They are subject to various types of fracture as those encountered in the upper arm bones. Therefore, correcting it is like correcting the arm; they are similar tasks. If both bones break completely, the leg will turn towards all directions. If only the thinner bone breaks, the leg turns forward. And if only the thicker bone breaks and this occurs below, then this goes without saying to you.
Use tension, adjustment, and ligament binding according to this principle. However, if the break of the leg is horrific with many pieces, then make the tension less and lighter, apply your force gently during correction.
In the leg, there is an additional task compared to the arm; when you adjust the ligaments and finish all your work, take two snail shells of juniper wood that are used for flattening chambers placed between grooves in boards or they can be from palm leaves or something similar.
Choose from it what has a slightly thick juice and is not amongst the sticky, and let its length be from the knee to below for each one. Then wrap two pricks around each of them on its length, placing one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let it be from the knee to down to the ankle, then tie the two femoral ligaments at three points on both ends and in the middle. With this, the leg cannot lean left or right improperly and will be securely held in place, properly immobilized. It may also use a pessary made of wood along the length of the leg.
It should be placed to protect it from movement, and more importantly, when dealing with a fracture especially if there is a specific wound, one must inspect the leg every day paying great attention to whether it has swollen or any other such issue. If something of that sort occurs, deal with it according to what is appropriate until it heals. The leg will become stronger in about thirty days or thereabouts.
Chapter Seventeenth.
In Broken Bones of the Leg and Fingers.
As for the heel, it does not break in a fracture of the patella. However, bones of the leg can break and similarly, fractures are less common to the fingers but rather, a dislocation happens more often.
If a fracture occurs in the leg bones and you see that some of those bones are rubbing against each other, place the patient on their feet as if they were standing then. Afterward, step onto the raised part by your foot, press down gently and smooth it out.
Until it returns to its place. Then, apply the bandage and splint under the foot with a small board having two flat ends. Next, firmly tighten the foot using this technique and wrapping it with a gauze, or whatever is required.
If three or four days have passed, then release the bandage. You will find that if it was a broken bone, it is now flattened out, or if it was a dislocated joint, it is now in its natural position. Do as you see fit. However, if some of the fingers break, force and straighten them according to what I described earlier for bending fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the broken finger along its length, slightly offset. Then place under the foot the board I have described to you and tighten it firmly. If two or three, or more bones broke in the body of the bone, this action will be effective.
For each finger, make a splint equal to the size of a small nail, made from soft material. Tighten the board under the foot and let every tip of the board stick out slightly below the foot's surface for proper adjustment.
And you should not forget to follow all that we have discussed with you regarding the various fractures of symptoms we mentioned, and respond to each symptom as appropriate.
The eighteenth chapter.
In the breaking of the woman's thigh bone and the man's shinbone, there is great pain and mention.
If the woman's thigh bone is broken, make her lie on her side and bend her slightly towards her back. Hold from behind and pull the underwear of her thigh until it fills the area and forms a ball inside her.
Then shake the woman slightly, lifting her up a little at a time. The cotton will come out until it's near her vaginal opening and forms a ball, then the fracture of the bone will heal. Then she should put on a back brace. If she needs to urinate, remove the cotton gently so she can urinate.
The procedure is as follows: you apply it after he first introduced it, then return to its initial application. Do this for seven days or approximately that period; if he will submit, and if you wish, take a goat bladder, tighten a tube's mouth around it, and insert the entire bladder into her urogenital opening.
Then inflate the tube with strength until the bladder inflates inside the genital opening. The fracture returns, then stuff it with cotton and keep it for as many days as described until it heals. If a bone from the thigh breaks in men or women, it should be used for supporting him during healing.
And settle it as we described for the thigh bone, and there is no deception in this regarding strange fractures that rarely occur, especially to those with some experience. If you understand my writing indeed, yes because the fracture itself often guides you in most cases.
On the path of correctness in supporting and tightening, understand. As for a man if his penis breaks, take an ostrich hoop, insert it into the penis then wrap it with a thread made from hemp fiber, tie it up, and let him leave it for three days or about that period until healing occurs.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In setting fractures if there is also an injury.
It is necessary for the one who encounters a fracture with an injury, especially if the bone is large like the thigh bone or the elbow bone and so forth, to hurry and address it at its due time when you have been assisted by the conditions of setting fractures as we have presented.
If the injury is bleeding, it is necessary to quickly cut it by applying a powdered anticoagulant if nothing else stops you. Then take care of setting the fracture on that day without delaying.
If no fever occurs, and if a hot lump does occur, leave its pressure until the ninth day till the hot lump subsides. Do not touch it on the third and fourth days as it might expose you to bad symptoms.
If the broken bone is revealed on the skin, it should be handled with your hands gently and steadily to reduce it. If you cannot reduce it using your hands, use this instrument; it's made of iron and its length is as long as seven or eight fingers. And expose it according to the size of the wound.
Therefore, the doctor should take three or four of them depending on what he needs for treatment in every type of fracture. It should be made to be somewhat thick so that it does not bend when rubbed during operation.
And it should have a sharp tip with a curved end, and its top should be thickened till half of its length at the bottom part becomes extremely thin. This is how it looks like:.
And they call it in Greek as 'Pirh' which means a small force. It should have a sharp, conical tip aimed at the bone end and push it with one hit until the bone returns and settles somewhat, then another hit to settle all ends of fracture together.
If its broken end is fragile and the machine hasn't taken it properly, it should be cut at that bone's tip so the machine can handle it. If unable to reduce the bone as described before, cut it in a manner similar to what we mentioned.
Or spread it with one of the splints as you can, then polish what remained in the bone from roughness and thin scabs. If after reducing the bone, finding the cavity became painful and disturbingly sore, know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
If you are able to return its deviation to its natural place, do so; for you will benefit the patient greatly. When you have balanced the bone completely, immerse the needle in a tight grip black drink, especially if it is summer. Do not cover the wound with cotton or anything greasy.
In order to prevent the occurrence of fungus and putrefaction, then use tongs when you are free from bone setting. Leave the wound exposed by cutting a hole with scissors in the folds at the size of the wound.
Be extremely cautious that you don't pull the wound too much with the break, as many unskilled doctors have done this causing either death or complications to their patients. Let your pull be gentle and different from the rest of the breaks.
If the wound is bad or large and I fear some bad symptoms as we described, and he finds pain in that place, then it's not good to put tongs on him. Instead, make him folds from hard needle with tongs at the location of the tongs and pull it with them.
If it's been a day or two and you see that the wound has started to produce pus, remove the needle that was placed on him with the drink. Then use the wick and ointments we usually use for wounds like the four-ingredient balm, and so forth. It would be good for you to change the bandage.
Inspect the wound in both the morning and evening until it heals, and it is necessary to position the member so that pus can flow down easily. If the wound has lasted for many days without healing or without pus stopping, you should know that there are small pieces of bone remaining.
You must inspect the wound with the instrument, and if any of those fragments are clean, remove them and expel them. If they are not clean, they will decay the member and cause pain. Therefore, insert and extract these parts through every possible way you can manage this task.
If the wound displays signs of putrefaction, consumption, or any other form of decay and infection, it should be met with a treatment equivalent to that described in its chapter, which is detailed for such cases.
And when you hear me speak of this, it should resonate in your mind that if a large bone were to break and fragment onto the body, such as the thigh bone or the back rib, and other major limbs, do not be subjected to its pull or its removal. Indeed, many times such situations result in death; instead, let it decompose. Perhaps it might detach from itself after twenty or thirty days.
And then, if you see an area for treatment in the wound, treat it. Otherwise, leave it as it is.
The twenty-first chapter.
In the treatment of complications that occur after certain fractures.
Complications often arise following fractures, particularly near the joints. These can distort the appearance of the limb and may even prevent it from functioning normally.
If the complication is soft, apply medicines that constrict such as sugar, milk, vinegar, donkey's milk, and so forth. Take some or all of these ingredients, mix them with a grip drink or with the white part of an egg or with lemon juice.
Carry it out on the complication with effort, tighten it firmly and leave the tension for many days. Then release it, then repeat this process until the complication leaves God willing or bind a sheet of solidly fitted lead to it.
If lead has a property that removes everything put into the organs, if the intricacy becomes stuck and tightens and necessity pushed for its removal, cut it from above and remove or strip off the corresponding part of fat or take some scabs away until it is removed and treated so that the wound may heal.
The twenty-first chapter.
In treating fractures, if it was forced and after that the member remained thin unlike its original texture.
If the bone fracture was forced and afterward the member remained thin and weak, this can be due to many reasons. One of the reasons could be either excessive use of ligaments and binding them incorrectly, or over-tightening the ligaments leading to food not being able to reach the member. Another reason might be excessive beating or striking, or exaggerated movements at inappropriate times, or lack of blood circulation in the patient's body which weakens it.
To treat this, nourish the patient and enrich his body so that there is plenty of blood in it. Use baths and make him happy and cheerful like that. Then apply the suction cup to the member to attract a large amount of food towards it or to keep applying water on the wound until it heals. Until food starts to move through it and returns to its natural shape, .
The second twenty-first chapter.
In treating broken bones, if they were forced and hindered their natural function.
When an organ that was forced after it has healed, or when there is distortion due to the broken bone, or when tightness and clogging have changed its appearance. Except that the member did not refuse to do its natural function, it is not appropriate for anyone who claims to break the member from head to say so. Many of our ignorant physicians and pressured ones used to do this in our country.
This action is very much condemned, leading to great deception and annoyance. However, if the cramp and discomfort are mild, it should be treated with water that has been boiled with relaxing herbs such as basil leaves, its stem, king's crown (likely a type of plant), etc.
It is treated with relaxing substances like the hard-boiled daxilin or it takes out the sap of basil leaves and mixes it with chicken fat and anus grease, then applies it. Or take fatty grapes and mix them with hen's dung and such other medicines known as anti-congestion remedies.
And in order to alleviate the discomfort, a continuous gentle rubbing is done with hands, and each movement of the body towards every direction is performed at all times. If cramps have occurred and intensified to the point where they are stuck, it became necessary to treat them with iron.
It is necessary to penetrate above it and release the bone connection, cut what has added of discomfort or bones into smooth sections, and apply care in this process. Then treat the wound with what was mentioned until healing occurs.
The Twenty-third Chapter
The jaw is a joint that, if it goes out of its place, hinders movement and spoils the appearance of the member. It causes severe pains and ailments for the patient. If someone's jaw becomes dislocated, they should immediately take action to restore it.
Do not delay it, for if it is delayed, swelling of the area increases and causes difficulty in retracting the jaw. Therefore, it should neither be delayed nor moved when it is swollen because it often causes painful cramps on the sick person.
However, if it is a case of exposure, one should promptly cut open the sick person, then leave him until the swelling subsides slightly. Then, the body part should be treated with hot water and oil, after which it should be gently manipulated. Each body part should be treated as specified in its respective location.
The sections for jaw dislocation have also been arranged according to the sequence of breaks starting from above the body and moving downwards.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In treating dislocation of the lower jaw.
The mandibles only dislocate in rarity. When they come out, it occurs on two possibilities: either they move slightly away from their positions and settle somewhat, or they come out completely and then relax. Up to around the chest, until saliva flows from the sick person and they cannot hold it back. They also can't bear to move their jaw and their tongue jiggles due to speaking. However, if his dislocation is slight, he will usually be able to return to his normal state with ease in most cases.
And if the dislocation is complete, it should be quickly reversed. It's necessary not to delay this process, which involves holding the sick person's head servant and having the doctor insert one of their fingers into the jawbone at its root if the jawbone comes from a single side.
Or if they are confused, all of them, when the jaws from both sides and all fingers of his hands outside are made equal with it, and the patient is ordered to relax his jaw and release for going in every direction. The doctor will make the jaw even and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
If it is difficult for them to return, especially if both jaws are present, then use the pliers with hot water and grease until their return becomes easier. Do not delay their return at all as we have said. When they do return, when they stand still and fit together in the mouth of the patient without relaxing, then place on each one of them incisions holders made from beeswax and grease and insert.
Then, it is tied gently with a relaxing strap. The patient should sleep on his back, and his head should be supported by two cushions so that he doesn't move to the right or left. He shouldn't chew anything; instead, he makes his food into small pieces.
Until the pain goes away and the jaw tightens, let him eat what seems suitable to him. Use this with caution; do not force opening his mouth when eating, drinking or swallowing until the jaw tightens and heals.
If the jaws do not return even if they disintegrate for some time and fail to return to their places, this often leads to fevers and chronic headaches. It might also cause abdominal protrusion or frequent vomiting. If you see these symptoms, know that there is a problem.
Many die from this condition within ten days.
The Twenty-Fifth Chapter.
In the process of returning the lower jaw and the tip of the foot.
If it is the ingrowing toenail, it does not cease from its position next to his chest and may extend outside. It can be felt by touch, so one should make him lie on his back with his arms extended.
Then press the place with your hand firmly. It will return, then put a pad and splint on it and tighten them. As for its end that touches the toe and is connected to it, it only comes off rarely; if it does come off once, it may need to be pushed back into place as described before, and you'll be ready for whatever follows.
Then place the pad, splints, and apply pressure. You should order the patient to rest in one position until they recover. With this same treatment, if the end of the toe also returns to its original position, it will heal with this method.
Chapter Twenty-Sixth.
In dealing with the return of the toe.
Know that the big toe may deviate in three directions: one, it can deviate towards the ankle downwards; two, it can deviate towards the chest and perhaps even upwards. This latter deviation is rare.
And it does not deviate to the back of the elbow region nor forward of the nerve. Most often, it deviates and goes downwards towards the ankle, especially in those with thin flesh because it emerges quickly and reenters quickly in them.
And as for those with abundant flesh, it is contrary in that it exits and enters difficulty. It might happen to some people that a blow or fall causes swelling of the toe which feels hot; they may think it has deviated, but it should be tested to confirm its health.
When then, he progresses in his treatment, and the jaw is identified if it goes downwards towards the stomach; when you observe between the protruding molar tooth and the right molar tooth, you find a seemingly contradictory thing, and you discover that there's a bump on the palate of the mouth. When you touch under the elbow, you find the molar at the elbow like an egg.
And the paralyzed person is unable to raise his hand to his ear or move it in any movements, also if you pull him towards the chest or above, you find that it is observable for touch.
And this jaw may facilitate its movement if it is soft or if the paralyzed person is a child, to move him you should have his servant raise his hand above then you place your fingers under his elbow and lift the joint upward to its place while the servant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Then he presses it downwards, and it quickly returns as expected. If it does not return in the way we mentioned and if the jaw has been affected for a long time, it is recommended that the paralyzed person bathes in hot water and uses something relaxing and soothing like cooking the stem of the fennel, carob pods, and royal crown in water and using it.
Then, the paralyzed person lies on his back and a ball of wool is placed under his elbow which has an intermediate texture between softness and hardness. Then, the doctor places himself behind the ball while holding the paralyzed person's hand and lifts it downwards.
And he pushes the ball with his foot, and it returns to its place. If you want to repeat this way, you can bring a longer leg than the paralyzed person, stop him on the side and insert your heel under the elbow of the paralyzed person, lifting his elbow upwards until the paralyzed person is suspended in the air. Another servant pulls the patient's hand down to his abdomen. If the patient is light, it should be hung with another object to make him heavier; he would then return from his support, and may also respond in another way.
And it is to concentrate on the ground a long piece of wood, its head round like that of an oboe not too thick nor too thin. It is placed under the hip of the patient after making a small scratch on the end of the stick. The patient stands along the length of the stick.
Then he extends his hand downwards from the other side and also extends his body strongly from that side. The joint returns to its place quickly. If it is difficult for him to return with all what we mentioned, use this treatment which is taking a stick whose length is about two arms long. And expose it the length of four fingers and make its thickness the length of two fingers, which should have a round head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the hip on this form:.
Then, tie a gentle scratch on the round head to avoid damaging the patient's wood. Place it under the hip and extend the hand and arm down onto the stick, towards the bottom. Finally, secure the stick on the back of the elbow and forearm with the hand tip.
Then, place the arm on a stand. Slide it in lengthwise and extend the hand downwards, leaving the rest of the body hanging from the other side. The joint will then enter through its support, should there be any difficulty in entry into its position, put under the hip a moderate-sized ball of wool.
Then, carry the prepared pad with camphor, frankincense and egg white across his buttocks as it rotates from above. Then tighten the ball under the hip firmly and rotate the rope around the pad from above, attaching his hand to his neck.
Leave the operated area untouched with your hand for seven days, and it is advisable to make the patient's food slightly cold until the member strengthens. This way of healing happens faster. Then, after the seventh day or the fifth, start training with movement. If stability is achieved and no pain persists, then the healing has occurred.
If the joint frequently dislocates due to moisture exposure or another reason, it is necessary to use the cupping method with three suction cups as explained in the section about cupping. If all this has been done and the ligaments have been released after seven days without stabilizing the joint, then...
Reapply the bandage and tighten it several times, but if it still doesn't hold, let it fall and relax; you will not be able to lift it up. Realize that the nerve in the knee joint might have been cut off, stretched or relaxed. Therefore, realize at this point that the joint will never remain in its place.
And as for the jaw that is near the chest and breastbone, when it needs to be returned towards these areas, you do this by pushing and pulling with your hands until it returns. Various types of tightening and treatment are used until healing occurs. If there is still a physical presence in the body after the process and if movement is slower than before.
Let the patient take hot baths frequently until that lump softens and returns to its original state.
The Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
In treating the dislocation of the shoulder.
The shoulder joint dislocates with difficulty and returns in the same manner, it also dislocates towards all directions, particularly forward or backward. Its dislocation should not be a secret to you because it occurs within your sight and touch, to what extent it has dislocated.
And if you compare the hanging appendage with the correct one, it will reveal to you a clear indication of dislocation in the joint; it cannot bend its arm or touch your buttocks, and it would be advisable for you to remove the jaw from your grasp before he presents it with a hot swelling.
And if he presents it with a hot swelling, its removal becomes difficult and it might not be completely healed, especially if the jaw is towards the back. It is worse among all types of jaws and more painful. Such cases often end up with death.
And for Gibr (a type of jaw), if it is capable of returning, a servant can stretch its both hands and arms fully with the doctor's hands above and below the appendage. He pushes the joint with all his fingers or even the bottom part of his palm until it returns to its place.
And if the jaw is towards the front, it may return by bending the arm once until it hits the bent elbow that follows it. If the jaw doesn't return upon this attempt, use intense powerful pull extremely - which means fully stretching the arm with both hands.
The assistant also holds both hands as well, so that when the arm is stretched it doesn't come loose. Then after wrapping or dragging the elbow over an item like folded clothing or a wide piece of cloth, if the doctor's hands are applied to the joint and wiped with grease, this makes it easier for the assistant to guide the joint back into place.
Then the joint is pushed hard until it returns. After its return, it should be wrapped with a bandage that contains grip and drying with egg white, pulling tightly and attaching the arm to the neck of the assistant for a few days.
Then if the joint is in its place, release it from bandages and leave it alone. If I find that the joint has not tightened enough, reapply the dressing and bandage again and leave them for a few days until they tighten then remove them. If it gets worse after returning the joint and removing the bandages.
If the movement becomes difficult, then the use of hot water from a bath and gentle rubbing, as well as kneading, should be used until it softens. Or you can make an arrangement like a thick camel's hump for the joint, then tie it on him for a day and night, then remove it and let him take a bath in the hot water, if he sweats, rub the joint gently but firmly.
Then repeat the arrangement for him one, two, and three times with a bath entry until it softens. If you want to apply wet cattle tallow mixed with oil and tie tightly on him, do this multiple times because he will soften and return to his original state.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In treating the dislocation of the elbow.
The elbow joint is prone to dislocation and repositioning, it is easier compared to other joints, but it should be expedited the repositioning of its dislocation when it happens before the place gets displaced or before the affected area cools down.
To reposition the dislocated elbow, you place the forearm on a board and extend its hand. The attendant does this while the doctor places his hand on the joint's axis and pushes it back until it returns. However, it should be checked whether the dislocation has moved to the inside of the hand.
When the hand is extended and retracted, the patient should place his palm on the board. If the dislocation protrudes onto the surface of the hand, he should place the inner side of his hand on the board for the doctor's hand to be placed on the same axis of the joint. If it returns immediately or otherwise, tie it with a bandage that soothes swelling.
Leave him alone and do not disturb him for it cannot bear repetition, nor can he recover from it after days have passed. Instead, the joint remains bent and does not harm the patient except if the hand has relaxed and is unable to hold onto anything.
Then, you will learn that the nerve has been severed or be satisfied with it; there is no solution in this case but to pull on the arm tightly. It may help or it may not make any difference. After successfully moving back the shoulder, wrap him up in the cloth we described and then pull and let go for five days.
Then, he will treat the hand. If it doesn't move and there is something of the body in it, it should be softened with hot water and steam until it becomes soft.
The twenty-ninth chapter.
In the treatment of breaking fingers.
The fingers may break in all directions. If one breaks towards the back of the hand or its underside, stretch the finger and push the break with your thumb until it returns. Then, fasten the tip of the finger and hang it towards the direction it broke to.
Leave it for two days, then release and extend it until it straightens by day. If this is done during the night, fasten it in the described manner, and it will continue to heal by day, train it with movement, and fasten it at night. Repeat this for several days until it strengthens.
Similarly, do this with it if one breaks towards the underside of the hand. Fasten it in that direction and perform your first action on it until it heals. Similarly, do this with it if it breaks to any other directions.
The thirty-first chapter.
In the treatment of freeing a stuck spine.
If a thorn is extracted from the back or neck's thorns, a complete extraction or if many thorns are removed from their places, there is no cure for it because death hastens to the invalid.
And the sign of that is that the excrement of the invalid comes out involuntarily, he cannot control it, and it often relaxes some of his limbs, either one of his legs or one of his arms or both. And if a thorn has been removed from its place, it often disappears again.
Its disappearance can be in four directions; if it goes backward, it is called a 'hurda'. As for its treatment, if the hurda occurred during childhood, there is no cure for her and no healing from her. However, if it happened due to falling or being hit, etc.,
I have mentioned earlier forms of treatment with long, often largely ineffective language. I have shortened what I consider sufficient from that abundant information by focusing closely on the meaning and explaining it, visualizing the device differently than they explained and illustrated it.
I say that if a hurda occurs in front of the chest, there is no remedy for it or escape from it. Similarly, if it happens to both sides as well. Only one that occurs in the back particularly needs treatment, which involves exposing the invalid on his face.
Place the patient on a flat oven near a wall and spread a wet mat underneath him to avoid injuring his chest. Then, place a standing board in a hole dug in the ground at one end of the oven near his head, and another board towards his feet at the other end of the oven.
A servant holds the stick and may not be fastened in the hole. Another servant holds the other part of it on this condition, then it wraps around the sufferer's chest and beneath his abdomen with a soft, thin cloth. An end of the cloth is brought to the stick which is at his head and tied to it.
Then, another cloth is pulled above his hips and over his knees, also around his waist. All the straps are then gathered and tied to the other stick which is held by the servant at his feet. Each servant extends his stick with the strap towards his respective side without allowing the two sticks to move from their fixed positions.
However, they are not fastened as we said. The doctor places his hands on the splint with force so that it can return or he puts a board on it and leans on the board with his legs until it returns. If this treatment does not work and the splint doesn't return to its place, take another board whose length is approximately three arms' length.
And you dig in the wall, which we said should be near the patient where a corner of the board can enter. Then, put the middle part of the board on the splint and place the doctor's foot on the other end. Pull with strength until it presses the splint.
And it returns to its place. If you wish, you can make it with the rod that twists in hand; bury two pieces of wood in the ground at the head of the patient behind the last pole, they should be one arm's length long. Also dig for two pieces of wood under his feet behind the same poles.
Let there be a space of one cubit between each piece of wood. Each piece should have a hole in it for the rod to pass through. The wood must all be firmly rooted into the ground so that nothing moves and an auger is driven down, which is the rod where the band passes through holes of the two pieces of wood.
In its end, there is a hole that he has documented with the length of an arm extending from it. In the two remaining pieces of wood like this one, they do likewise. Then tighten the belt which you tightened on the patient's chest in the tube at his head and the belts tightened on his legs in the tube at his feet.
Then he stands at each tube, holding the tool that is used to rotate the tube. The doctor shapes the scoop according to what we have brought; this is a picture of the tube, the tool (dakkah), and the ill person:.
Then, after the feces has returned and the position is stabilized, it should be that a dry dressing will be lifted with the whiteness of egg white. Then comes exertion, then one places a clamp from a board which has an width of three fingers or approximately this amount, and its length corresponds to the size of the scoop.
On some correct beads, then he ties with the belt that should be used. The patient uses light food while wearing a diaper until he recovers completely. If there are still some stones in their place after the last stage of recovery, it is necessary to use medicines that relax and soften, employing the board we described for a long time previously.
And in this situation, you might use a lead plate. A stone might appear after the last beads of back sweat, making one think it is peeling off; this may be an additional bone that has grown along with the stones. It should not be treated in such a manner as it could potentially lead to death.
The thirty-first chapter.
In treating the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the knee joint are only affected by dislocation, not other minor malpositions or indentations as can occur with other joints. The hip joint dislocates on four sides.
That is, it extends inwards and outwards, before and behind, and more often inwards than outwards. The sign of extension inwards is that when you compare the healthy leg with the sick one, the sick leg will be longer.
The knee is more bent than the healthy one. The patient can't bend his leg at the crease, and the location of the crease is far ahead compared to where it should be. This area right behind the crease shows clearly before the thigh bone reaches there.
The sign that the jaw protrusion is towards outside is opposite symptoms, while the sign of the jaw protrusion being forwards is extending his leg fully without bending it under normal circumstances, as he can't walk forward.
He retains his urine and the crease behind him becomes prominent when walking. The sign of the jaw protrusion being towards back is that he cannot fully extend his knee or bend it before his crease does, and also that his leg is also shorter than others.
The crease is loose, and the thigh bone is clearly visible at the place of the back. As for the opposite condition of this jaw protrusion, if you observe that an old jaw that has aged with its owner and did not try to return to normality, remaining in his state, there is no treatment for it.
It should not be exposed to it, and as for the one whose jaw is recent and was of any type among the four faces of the jaw, you need to take action by bending the joint and extending it inwards and outwards, moving it left and right; this might help.
He returned and did not require anything other than treatment, if he didn't return in this manner, it is recommended to have a strong servant stretch his leg from below either with his hands or with a strap that is tied on his leg above the knee. Another servant should help him from above.
Enter his hands from under his waist then pull with a soft cloth at the root of the thigh and hold the other end of the cloth for another assistant, making either a forward movement towards the Arabic side to the strengthening side or backwards towards the back and the spine.
All of them should be done once until the patient raises his body from the ground and remains hanging, for this type of pull is a common type among the four kinds. If it returns to what we said about it, or otherwise, there must necessarily be a specific treatment for each kind as I mentioned.
If his return is internal, it should be that the patient lies on their correct side then place cloths at the root of the thigh in between the tip of the thigh and the area under the Arabic [a term referring to a specific anatomical location], according to where the pull was directed.
Then extend the band from above towards the Arabic area, up to higher parts of the body towards the strengthening side. Then, another assistant supports by their arms and embraces the thick part of the hanging thigh, extending it strongly outward. He then returns to its place.
This type is easier than other treatments that have a return for this member. If you are unable to do it or he does not respond by entering into this treatment method, it should be that you bind all of the patient's legs with strong soft bands around the heels and the knees.
Each of his companion has after it the length of four fingers, and the hanging leg is extended more than the others by two fingers. Then, the patient hangs on a board which is in the room from his head, being two arms' distance away from the ground.
Then command a strong servant to hold the thigh and connect another servant with him, and make the other servant push on the held thigh with force. The joint then returns to its place quickly, and as for its special reaction if it is outside.
The servant should lie down on the pallet as described about the one in the book of the stiletto. Tightly fasten the bandage to his crippled leg and also on his chest. Then place two planks, one under his feet and the other at his head. A larger plank should be placed centrally inside the pallet with very firm attachment.
He has wrapped her in a wet bandage so she doesn't harm the servant, keeping the plank between her thighs to prevent it from sinking when she swells, then each servant stretches towards his side and the doctor adjusts the hip with his hands, if he responds to going back.
And otherwise, place the board and fasten it as described in the book whether or not he should have the servant lie on his side correctly, if the amputation is frontward, then it should be that the servant's leg is extended once, being in exactly this description lying on the pallet.
The doctor places his right hand on the pubis of the servant, then he presses it with another hand while making the pressure extended downwards towards the knee. If the amputation is behind, it should not allow the servant to go down.
He is standing on the ground but he should be placed on something solid as it should also allow his hip and knee to protrude outward according to how we described him lying on the pallet with his head down, and the bandages are tight.
On what we have mentioned before, it is necessary to use the pill on the plate as well in the place where the joint went out. If the thigh joint returns to its normal position as expected and the sign of its return becomes visible to you, which is that your patient extends his legs.
If you see both at the same level and when the patient clenches and extends his legs without any pain, know that the limb has returned to its normal position. Then, press the thighs together, hold the bandage firmly, pulling tightly with your girdle so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must rest for three or four days, then loosen the bandage and the pad. Lift one leg at a time as high as possible, if you see them level in height, know that the knee has stabilized, and let the patient walk with the released patient. If you notice any relaxation within it.
Return and wrap him, tighten it as you did the first time, and leave him also for three days. Then remove it and let him walk slowly on it for a while until it strengthens well if God wills.
The Second and Third Chapters.
In the treatment of dislocation of the knee.
The knee dislocates in three directions: inward, outward, and downward or behind, not forward. The sign of its dislocation is that the patient orders to bend his leg towards his shin.
If it does not stick to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. Gently fix all aspects of its dislocation, have the patient sit down if he can do so and extend his legs; otherwise, sit him behind you with your back against his chest and bend him slightly backward. Then, sit on his thighs.
You place your back against their face and put one leg between yours, then bind their knee with your hands and twist them together in between their toes on the knee. Then you push both sides of their knee hard with your palms until another attendant extends their leg so that the knee returns to its original position.
The sign that they have recovered is when the leg sticks to the thigh in a gentle manner, not causing discomfort. Then extend and stick the leg onto the thigh and then bind them all with three or four bandages. Afterwards, release them. It should only be used for slight walking for a few days until they strengthen.
If returning her as described is difficult for you, otherwise use strong stretching with the bands that I have provided instructions for in treating the hip, until it returns.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In treating the untying of the heel.
The heel may slip off gradually or completely detach. Detaching the heel can either be inward or outward. The sign of detachment is that you will see the inflated and prominent heel towards the direction it has detached to.
If it is a gradual slip, then returning it is relatively easy; you just need to gently guide it back and smooth it out until it returns. However, if it has completely detached, the method should be more meticulous. You should sit on your heels with someone strong holding their hands from behind him in the middle of his back.
Then, you hold her foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below at the ankle position. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand and then with your left twice. Extend it with your left hand, pushing the foot's chest against the leg without force.
This procedure is done twice as we described, then push the foot's chest towards the leg in the third time while pulling on the string. If it returns to this form once or twice and you find that the foot has been flattened, do not redo the work if not; otherwise, repeat the operation because it will return so.
If it does not return to its original form as we described, then place the patient on their back on the ground and insert it deeply into the earth with a very firm stake so that it gets stuck between his thighs. It is necessary to tie it with a girth around him in order to prevent injury to the patient, then adjust his ankle.
Then, another attendant extends the legs either with his hands or by attaching a strap around the leg. Each attendant moves against their counterpart; there is a tension on both thighs of the patient preventing his body from going down when they stretch him, and then, the surgeon smoothes out the jaw with his hands.
Another attendant holds the correct leg downwards, and then the jaw returns quickly. When the jaw returns and you see that it has returned correctly, carry the gauze and tensioner, tighten them with tight straps, and pull the leg with the strap downwards. It is important to be careful of the nerve located above the heel from behind.
So that the strap does not hurt him too much, leave it for two or three days. If the strap relaxes, tighten it again and then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If he tries to walk before this time, it may cause the jaw to slip and harm him, nor will he accept treatment afterwards. If a hot lump appears on him, it is recommended to use what we have described previously in other parts of the treatment and pressing until it goes away.
The Thirty-Fourth Chapter.
In the treatment of separating fingers of the hand.
It is necessary that you gently smooth out what has been dislocated with a short stretch without force, for this is not difficult but rather makes things easier. If the dislocation occurred in parts of the foot's arch, it should be made so that his leg is on a level ground surface.
Or on a board while he stands like a shepherd, then you yourself place your foot on the joint that was dislocated and then press it with your foot with strength until it returns and you see it having been smoothed out without any appearance of dislocation in its position.
Then put under the sole of his foot a board that will take the entire foot, having two ends for it. Then stretch him with a firm and tight pull for three days, then let him rest and keep him off walking for many days until it strengthens and he can return safely, if God willing.
The Thirty-Fifth Chapter.
In the various types of dislocation that may occur with injury or fracture, or both simultaneously.
If something like this happens and its treatment involves many forcings, it often leads to death.
Therefore, it should not be attempted to treat such a condition except by someone who is skilled in craftsmanship, long-sighted, gentle and thoughtful, not reckless or impulsive, and he should start with the medications that alleviate the hot swellings only and leave the patient in care.
For the sake of fate, may God grant safety from any discomfort with a light illness and show you some hope in it. Reject any response from your mercy at the beginning before the hot tumor manifests itself.
If the limb returned to what was desired, use the treatment that calms hot swellings and treats the wound with suitable dried ointments. If there is a fracture in the jaw accompanied by splinters of clean bone, remove them. And it adhered to what we mentioned in simple diseases as provided in its respective sections.
And strive, purify yourself from entering the path of error as you have been instructed for. This will protect your efforts and safeguard your status if God wills it.
