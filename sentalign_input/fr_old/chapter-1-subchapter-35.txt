of the fleshiness that is called "thelul"
When you cut the "thelul", heat the cautery that resembles a razor, and then place it completely hot on the cut "thelul"; and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, from which the blood flows; do this once or twice, and if there is a lot of "thelul", cauterize each as we have said; afterward treat with beneficial ointments until healed; and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the "thelul", it will be more helpful.
