On the incision of strophulas (small, often cystic or glandular swellings) in the neck.
Chapter 42.
These abscesses often appear in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin; sometimes they appear in other parts of the body as well.
And among those that appear in the neck, they may be single or multiple and often arise one after another. Each strophula is contained within its own membrane, much like the nodes and abscesses of the scalp, as we have previously described.
And there are many types of these strophulas.
Some of them are stone-hard; others contain fluid; still others are malignant and resist treatment.
For those among them that appear to have a healthy constitution when touched—clearly close to the color of the skin, mobile in all directions, and not attached to the neck’s nerves, major blood vessels, or arteries, and not deeply embedded—you should incise it superficially from the upper part to the lower part of the body along line b to line g. Strip it away completely, and use hooks or multiple hooks, as needed, to pull back the edges of the skin as we described in the case of scalp abscesses, and gradually extract it.
And take extra care not to cut any vein or nerve.
Use a rounded, not too sharp spatula so that it does not add pressure with your hand during the incision, or cause unnecessary discomfort to the patient, nor lead you to cut beyond what is necessary.
If you cut a vein or artery or it obstructs your work, then apply powdered alum (zegi) or some other styptic powders to the wound to staunch the bleeding, bandage the wound, and leave it alone until the swelling of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens or starts to suppurate.
Once the bleeding stops, return to your work and continue until the procedure is complete.
Then, use your index finger to check if any small strophulas remain; if so, incise and clean them.
If a large vein is present at the root of the strophula, you should not cut the strophula from its root; instead, tie it off with a strong, doubled thread and leave it to fall off on its own without causing harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Then tend to it.
If the entire strophula is incised, then you should bring the two edges of the wound together and suture it immediately, as soon as you are certain that there is no remaining excess.
If you see that some excess remains due to the size of the strophula, then you must focus on cutting its root and extracting it, and then apply the sutures as we discussed.
For those strophulas that contain fluid, make a superficial incision to reveal the location of its ripening, and place the incision at the lower part to allow drainage downward, as we have described.
Then, after the incision, apply lint with ointment or similar substances to corrode any remaining infection until you see that the wound is thoroughly cleansed. At that point, treat it with a flesh-regenerating ointment until it heals.
