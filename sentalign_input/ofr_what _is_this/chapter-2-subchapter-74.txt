of abscesses of the womb/uterus
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb/uterus, such as canker and stony abscess and herpes and corroding ulcers and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and several other illnesses that I mentioned in the division/classification.
It is therefore necessary that I discuss in this treatise the hot abscess that occurs in the womb/uterus, which is not among the abscesses that collect pus; and if you want to know how to proceed, observe if the abscess is acute at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it.
Then do not rush to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain subsides; and then have the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats where she leans, and supports her back and brings her feet together towards the lower part of the leg; and let her thighs be spread, and put her arms under her knees, and tie them well with a good cord; then have her lean slightly towards her right side, and apply the instrument used to open the mouth of the womb/uterus, the form of which follows below; and it is necessary that when you want to use this instrument, you first insert the probe to determine the depth of the womb/uterus, so that the part of the instrument that enters does not go deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is too large, you must cover the depth of the womb/uterus with cloths, so that the instrument does not hurt her; and she must put the tube of the instrument above, and hold the instrument. 
And when the abscess opens, and it is pressed by the soft hand, it must be lanced at the top, with a milk spatula; and when the pus is drained, you must put in the wound tents soaked in rose oil, or in dried green oil; and place the tent outside the wound at the depth of the womb/uterus, and place over the womb/uterus and over the perineum clean wool soaked in water where mallows have been boiled; then treat it after two days with a suitable ointment, until it is healed; and sometimes the womb/uterus and the wound are cleaned with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water in which roots of lily and long birthwort have been boiled; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep in the womb/uterus, you must avoid cauterizing with iron, but treat it as we have described in the classification/division.
