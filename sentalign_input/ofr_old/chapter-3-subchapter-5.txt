of the collarbone
The collarbone often breaks in front, towards the shoulder, and the fracture occurs in three ways: either it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, which is the easiest to restore; or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure is that when the fracture is without a wound, you need two assistants, one to hold the support for the broken collarbone; and the other to extend the neck towards the area; then align the fracture with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is no misalignment or shortening.
And if you need more extension, place a round ball of cloth or wool under the patient's shoulder, and make it thick according to your need; and extend and lift the collarbone, and tighten the ball with your hand, so that you set the fracture evenly, as is necessary.
And if you cannot pull the head of the collarbone outward, because it is deep, the patient must lie often on their back, and place a medium pillow under the shoulder, and the assistant pushes the shoulder down, so that the collarbone is raised.
Then align the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it broken into pieces, you must cut above; and gently extract the pieces, and if the bone cannot join due to any overlap, cut it with one of the incising tools you have; but place this instrument under the collarbone to protect the membrane:
and it looks like a spoon, and is not finished, and should be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the extent of the work; and it has two ends, as you see, one wide, and the other narrow, as is the shape of the wound you made when you extracted the bones;
and when you are sure of preventing a hot abscess, sew the wound, and if the cut is small, or you fear a hot abscess, fill the wound with cloths and tents, according to its size.
And if a hot abscess occurs there, moisten a cloth with rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is to apply a poultice of mill dust and plenty of eggs to the bone, place light tow on it, and place a ball under the armpit if necessary;
then take a very large bandage one palm wide, then place a double cloth over the tow, and the poultice; then take a delicate splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around the bandage, so that the ends of the bandage hang down;
and place the splint on the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the injured armpit; and secure it from each side, and when you see that the binding holds the fracture well, and you see clearly that the splint does not move on the broken bone, adjust it every day, and when the binding loosens, tighten it;
and have the patient lie on their back, and place a small pillow under the armpit when they sleep, to lift the support upwards; this will relieve the fracture of the collarbone by lifting the shoulder, or tie the arm to the neck, and do not untie it unless bad symptoms occur, for twenty days;
then restart the poultice if necessary, and tighten it and leave it so, until it is restored; and it is restored in at most twenty-eight days, and in less for some people.
