Of the uvula	On removal of the tumour of the uvula that is called 'uva'.	0.5235387
This treatment is safer than cutting or cautery; if it is treated with fumigation in this manner, take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, chamomile, oats, and similar herbs, and combine all or some of them in a pot, and add plantain, and boil them; and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and in the middle of the pot have an instrument with this tip: And it should be made of silver or fine bronze, and one end should be placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is mortified; then repeat this often, until the uvula dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the hot abscess, as many things can happen; and only do this when the hot abscess is in decline. And if this instrument is not available, take a tube and place an eggshell at the end, so that the patient's mouth does not get too hot; for the eggshell prevents the vapor from harming the mouth, and it is a good and safe treatment.	This kind of treatment is safer than incision and less to be feared. Sometimes uva is cured by a method milder than either incision or cautery, namely by means of vapour in the following manner: take pennyroyal and artemisia absinthium and organy and rue and wormwood and chamomile and southernwood and similar herbs and put them all, or some of them, in a pot, cover them with vinegar, and boil them. The pot should be luted with clay; and there is to be a hole in the middle of the lid to which is fitted a hollow instrument like this, made of silver or bronze, and the end in which is the protuberance should be put in the patient's mouth so that the vapour passes up the tube to the uvula, which becomes of a very dark colour. Do this repeatedly till it sloughs away.	0.86664665
