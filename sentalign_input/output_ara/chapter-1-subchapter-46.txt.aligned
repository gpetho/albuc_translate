On Cauterizing a Callous.	On cauterization for contusion.	0.6875114
If there occurs in some limb, due to a fall or a blow, a pain, and that pain persists for a long time and treatment with medicines does not work, then it should be cauterized with a point cautery. And the cauterization of each limb should be according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.	When pain occurs in some limb due to a fall or a blow and the pain becomes chronic and medical treatment has no effect upon it, you should cauterize it with the punctate cautery. In each case the cauterization should be in proportion to the size of the limb, its strength or weakness, and the chronicity of the pain and contusion in it.	0.89475167
And the pain and the callus will be located by it. If it heals from the first cauterization, then fine. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on it, because it is the nature of these pains to move from the limb to what is near it, so it is necessary to follow it with the cautery until the patient recovers.	If it is cured at the first cauterization, good; otherwise repeat the cauterization. For it is customary for these pains to move from one part to a neighbouring part, and you must follow them with the cautery till the patient is cured.	0.811672
