Of fracture with wound
It is necessary for someone with a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder or similar, that they be bled immediately, as we have previously described.
And if the wound heals, staunch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin to restore the fracture at the same time or that day, if no hot abscess forms.
And if a hot abscess forms, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, as you could cause a bad condition.
And if the fractured bone is visible under the exposed flesh, you must set it carefully with your hands, with slight extension.
And if the extension is not sufficient to set it with your hands, use this iron instrument, which is seven or eight fingers long, and the width is according to the size of the wound; and therefore the physician must have three or four of them, according to what is needed for each fracture treatment; and it should be round and a little thick, so it does not bend under pressure on the limb during your work, and it should be pointed at the front, and thick in the middle, like this:
And it is called "palainche," for the curved end should be placed on the head of the exposed bone; and press it once, until it returns, and is even with the other. And if the fracture is delicate, and the instrument cannot grip the bone well, you must cut the head of the bone, so that the instrument can grip it.
And if you cannot set the bone as we have said, cut it with a suitable instrument, either a chisel or saw, as needed; then smooth what remains in the bone of roughness and small fragments.
And when the bone is set, and the patient feels great pain afterwards, know that it is not in its natural place. So make sure it is in its place, then moisten a cloth in dark styptic wine, especially if it is summer; and do not put cerate or anything with oil on the wound, as it could cause decay and corruption; then apply splints when you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the cover all around, according to the size of the wound, and be very careful that the wound is not compressed with the fracture; many foolish physicians have done this, and have caused death or gangrene in the patient at times; and the binding should be softer and gentler than in other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that bad conditions may develop, as we have said, and you find pain in the area, do not apply splints; instead wrap around it, instead of splints, with hard cloths, and bind them. And when you see after a day or two that the wound is generating pus, remove what you have applied with wine, and apply a healing ointment, such as tetrafarmacum ointment or similar.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, in the morning and evening, until it is fused and healed.
And the limb must be positioned in such a way that the pus can drain easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot fuse but continuously produces pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, which must be removed by probing the wound with a tent, and removing all these loose pieces that cause this pain.
And if a fistula develops in the area, or another type of corruption, you must treat it, as stated in the previous chapter. And when the bone is fractured and exposed on the limb, such as the thigh bone or shoulder bone, and other similar large bones, do not pull it out, as this can often cause death; instead leave it until it rots; it will fall off on its own after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound if you can; if not, leave it.
