Chapter twenty-one on cutting the uvea.
If a rupture occurs in the uveal layer, then it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids like a grape, thus disfiguring the person's appearance.
And if you want to remove it, the procedure is as I describe.
It is that you insert a needle into the base of the grape-like swelling from bottom to top.
Then you insert another needle, which has a doubled thread, from the side of the corner of the eye and pass it through, leaving the first needle as it is.
Then you cut the place where the doubled thread is folded and tie some of the swelling around the needle and tighten it well.
Then you remove the needle and place wool moistened with egg white on the eye and leave it until the threads fall off with the swelling.
Then you treat the eye with what strengthens it until the wound heals.
The swelling may also be tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth so that the swelling increases well.
Then it is lanced with a thin scalpel that reaches the depth of the eye, so that the watery fluid flows out and the swelling subsides and withers on the spot.
Then you tighten it until it heals.
