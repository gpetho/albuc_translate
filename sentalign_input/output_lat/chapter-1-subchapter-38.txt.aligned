On cauterization of the urinary bladder.	On the Method of Cauterizing the Bladder	0.65901184
When there occurs in the urinary bladder a weakness and relaxation due to chill and humidities, so that the patient cannot retain his water, sear him once below his navel, on the bladder, where the pubic hair begins; burn him once also on the right side and once on the left side of the navel; and let the distance of the burn from either side be the length of the joint of the thumb. Cauterize him also once on the lower part of the back, or twice if you need. The cautery should be claviform, as described.	When there is weakness and relaxation in the bladder due to cold and moisture, causing urinary incontinence, cauterize the lower part of the abdomen, above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins. Apply cauterization on both the right and left sides, with a length approximately that of the thumb joint. Additionally, cauterize the lower back, using one or two cauteries if necessary, following the nail-like cautery form previously described.	0.82008743
