Otherwise, she should open it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.	Infants are quite often born with the anus imperforate, closed by a fine membrane; then the midwife should perforate the membrane with her finger or pierce it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.	0.8474369

Blockage of the anus may also occur from the healing of a wound or a swelling. It is necessary to incise that healed area then treat it with what we mentioned of treatment and lead.	Sometimes also the anus is closed by the scarring of a wound or an abscess; then the scarring should be incised, and then dressed by those methods we have mentioned, including the leaden tube.	0.71190774
