of the large hanging lumps/swellings/goiters
Sometimes a thelul occurs in the belly and nowhere else, and it is a disease which is called "fungus" because of its resemblance to them, and its root is thin, and its head large;
and there are some small and some very large;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly that looked more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and they had a slender root, and they had already split open, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
I cut them out and found in one eighteen ounces in weight, and in the other six and a half, and the procedure for the incision is that you consider if the patient is moist/phlegmatic, and the color of the growth is white and moist and with a thin root;
then cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cauteries ready at hand.
For during the cutting, excessive bleeding often occurs, and if the blood overcomes you, then hurry to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and afraid of the incision with the iron, then take a well-made lead wire, and tie off the growth as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then tighten it, and do not stop tightening the lead wire until it cuts through the growth, and it falls off by itself without difficulty;
and if the roots are large, be careful when cutting, especially near the abdomen, but you can safely cut away half of it, then cauterize it so it does not grow back; 
then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the swelling which has a pale color and little feeling and a milky appearance.
For this is a cancerous abscess, and I will come to the treatment of cancer later.
