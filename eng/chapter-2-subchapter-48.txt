 CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT.
On the opening of axillary tumours.
 These tumours under the armpit are of the type of scrofulous tumours, hard, enclosed in a capsule.
Some contain humidity.
Those that contain humidity should be opened with a semicircular incision like this, from b to g. When you have removed all the pus that had been in the tumour, pack the wound with teased-out cotton wool and leave till another day.
Then remove the cotton wool and dress with a suitable ointment until healed.
If the tumour be of the nodular scrofulous kind, cut directly down on it just as we prescribed for that kind.
If the wound continue to discharge pus, apply the cautery to it as prescribed before.
