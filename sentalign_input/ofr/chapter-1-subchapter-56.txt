when the artery is cut
Many times large flows of blood occur from the artery which is cut in a wound that comes to the surface, or in the incision of an abscess, or in the cautery of a limb, and in similar things; and it is a very difficult thing to stop.
And nevertheless, when this happens to someone, hurry to put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press it hard until the blood is calmed under your finger, and no more drops come out; then put several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire until they are all red; then take one, either large or small depending on the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on the vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease to do this one after the other until the blood is stopped; and be careful not to burn the nerve that is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient; and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be easily stopped, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways that we have mentioned: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not severed, or by tight tying with thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to stop blood; and let it be tied and constricted properly.
Whoever would attempt to stop it by tightly binding with cloths or by putting burning things on it, or other similar things, will benefit little if at all. 
And if this happens to someone and they do not have a doctor or medicine present, they should put their index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until it is stopped over the wound and over the vein; and do not move the finger, but wet it with cold water, very cold water, often until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped; and from then on do what is necessary with cauteries and medicines.
