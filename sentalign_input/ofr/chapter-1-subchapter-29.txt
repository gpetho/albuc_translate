Of the cautery of pleurisy
The ancients said that for pleurisy, cauteries should be made from the roots of birthwort, and in this manner:
Take a long birthwort root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and be as thick and as long as your finger;
and soak it in oil, and light it on fire, and cauterize one cautery between the armpit and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower down in the area that is below the chin;
and two cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, sloping downwards a little;
and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another over the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the chest outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but do it lightly as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use an iron cautery resembling a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess;
and the pain jumps out, as we have said regarding the abscess of the liver.
But in this procedure, there is danger that the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops that cannot be healed.
