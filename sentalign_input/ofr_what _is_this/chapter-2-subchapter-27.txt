of abscesses of the lips
In many men, hard abscesses appear inside the lips, resembling vetch grains, both smaller and larger; then you must turn the lips, and cut open each knot, and take it with tweezers and cut it on each side; then fill the place after the incision with ground vitriol, until the blood is stanched; and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the area with drying agents until it is healed.
