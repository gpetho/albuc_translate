Oh children, you have completed this book of medicine for me, which I regard as the latest in science on health and wellness thanks to your efforts; through our discussions about it, my explanations regarding its content, and statements made by us concerning it—I see that you are complexing (understanding or comprehending) with all due care this part of a surgical operation.
When the operation is humbled in our region and time, as long as I observe you with my eyes, but only some small descriptions are made among free Antics works; these I change into errors which entrap them within their concepts and elongate strength and art.
Here comes the sentence to translate: And I have seen that you understand this treatise according to its second method of presentation and explanation through demonstration and abbreviation; therefore for completion with tools required by cautery and other instruments used in this work, which is necessary.

May we already have told you about that in the entry of this free; who do not know what we have told them regarding anatomy, they will fall into error and serve death if so much as one of these things has been seen by them—these are formed within this science and taken from its knowledge and experiments.
Here is the translation of each line:
Here comes another doctor who orders that the patient swallows a stone of clay which had progressed in his state; this stone was large and entered into him via the vein, leading to the patient's death by the third day.
And you have called her out from there to be taken down because of the greatness of the stone and due to the position of the bladder undernethy where she will die.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And another doctor took his salary from our land'dictor and brought with him an iron shackle that he had used as a fracture in the patient's thigh; preparing himself, knowing nothing about surgery, broke the fracture on the ground using strong pillows and beds.
Here is the line-by extralinguistic translation:
And it has been called unto him/her, and tools have been provided for untying the ligaments; thus achieving calmness and relief from their pains.

The cause is the head that needs to be treated for excessively melancholal humoral (referring to black bile), not just arriving there from anywhere in total but being a member of the body where it has been housed already.
And for that reason, men and women are required to have the operation planned in two divisions: one associated with health (in surgery), and another where there is a risk involved in major operations.

Begin with the division of the book and start first in its initial section/parting. The statement appears directed towards someone who is about to read or analyze a text that has clearly been organized into sections (parts), suggesting The first chapter within the section concerning legs and metallic tools (instruments), especially for those required in surgery/treatment procedures. Here "primier" refers to what is initially or fundamentally important, indicating that this part of a larger text—possibly about medical instruments used by surgeons during operations—will likely cover essential topics such as the types and uses of these tools (instruments) in surgery ("opperacio"), highlighting their significance for effective
The division or section concerning the second part/section within a larger work, possibly indicating that what follows are further details relevant The second chapter detailing the specifics of surgical and perforating tools (scalpels), ventouses (suction devices used in surgeries to remove fluids from body cavities), drains, as well as extractions relating to spirits or similars. This sentence is structured with an emphasis on cataloging the various types of surgical instruments and their intended uses within medical procedures ("extractio de sagetas" might refer to some form of suction used for removing substances from body cavities, "semblantz ad aquelle," could denote materials or elements

Therefore say that the discourse of cautery and darkness is long and elaborate due to science and secrecy; they discuss much about significant things, and often disagree among themselves, which suffices for me as a small part of their conversations, out of fear of prolongation.
And so it is said that the applied cautery comforts all of the body universally, except for two kinds of complexes, which are parts of his material substance.
In the complexity of the dry matter; they find that some heating needles are beneficial for this condition, and others counteract it—since its nature is both moisture and a lack thereof, suitable treatment involves wetting and sealing such material with water-based cautery.
Here comes the sentence to translate: When you examine that which is contrary of it (the situation), whereby through cauterization one treats completely all types of dry and painful feet in men when comparing the man' extricules with their humors at the complexity of the focus, then by this action damage occurs to the man's extremities.
Through that speech of his, I have discovered some things for myself already.
Even if he doesn't remove the one that has already been exposed and exercised in the cautery of yesterday's practice, understand their complexity as humans and how diseases are arranged within them, including the causes of these ailments and the time intervals for such occurrences.
May also in other complexities there is not fear among doctors; mostly regarding the cold and wet humors where they all agree on treating those issues with caution using instruments for treatment in that area, without desecoring the patient'thy flesh (with cautery).
And the wise ones who understand healing through points on the focus area and their benevolence towards themselves, apply them to medicine as curative tools; for the focus is simple, and only reaches the limb it was cauterized upon, not affecting other members of the body except by a minor harm.
May the medicine burn reach that in their limbs where it has lodged, and forcefully enter into the ill member with difficult cure and hasty departure.
May the focus, due to its sublimity and benevolent substance, does not cause excess but rather heals us; we have understood this through experimentation and long study of servitude in learning about art on truth concerning causes—and so by word alone is excused for lengthiness. If I were not free during these pauses to reveal my secrets at the focus, it would sharpen our intellects like philosophic discourse herein discussed among us; this sharpens thoughts and surgical operations in limbs which expel diseases—as if through a philosophic dialogue.
Indeed, wise ones know that it is best to perform cauterizations and stops (or rests) during the coolest parts of early morning.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "E yeu dic that cautery is convenient at all times, in order that harm caused by water retained due to cautery can be drawn back into it, especially if used for pains or necessary interventions such as fractures and bleeding points. The risk of these harms occurring over time exceeds the minor damage from occasional use.
So you do not feel pain in your feet or legs; they are only estimated by the common people and ignorant physicians, so that healing with cautery is not complete without rest for this ailment'dictate. Here is the translation line by line:
E the cause is not internal where they suffer from it, for cauldrons are only in medical places that change the complexity and evaporate the moistures which are causes of pain to come here.
Even though there are unnecessary points on the surface of medicine due to its excess and operation, as well as great magnificence of their lord,
It is possible that his illness may return at some time during the day due to the complexity of the disease and its location in him; moreover, what has been prepared on the patient's backside for excess fluids therein as a result of those causes which he ingested today or yesterday. If cautery (treatment) is administered to that illness within his small body parts with superfluous quantities and moisture, possibly it will not return in him; but if such pain appears on the finger(s), possible treatment there might prevent its recurrence herein today.
Even the common language may be that healing is at the doorstep of medicine, and it'dicts not what we understand here but rather how deeply I delve into medical treatment or other causes for which this intervention (cauterization) can provide relief.

When treating ancient migraine (as mentioned before for curing), and as indicated in the divisions of diseases, if proper care is not taken or applied to cauterization (citing earlier methods used by medicine or focal points such as a heated lancet), sometimes when there isn't enough fire from those initial burns done with medical tools like lancets on focus areas for migraine relief, you place the remaining heat within the incision point marking where pain is located along its length; and rest your hand lightly yet firm inside this wound area.

For the treatment of joint pains in fingers." Here, 'cauterizes' refers to using heat or chemical substances to remove (or reduce severity)
When in the finger there is pain due to cold and it is treated for these causes as well as I have described elsewhere (in this division), hence not being relieved by fire alone. Here we use cauterization with a pointed instrument, which is what has been referred to here." This passage discusses treatment methods beyond just heat application; the practitioner advocates using specific types of physical intervention such as applying point-based localized burns (cauterizations) for pain relief in fingers caused by conditions that are not alleviated solesly through exposure to fire. The cautery instrument is pointed, indicating precision may be required when targeting small areas like a finger where treatment needs can vary based on the specific condition being addressed and its location within the body's structure
And apply punctures with fire herein (referring back to the topic of cauterization), and it is taken all over the finger joint as if rolling a wheel, or along any part where there's pain in one."

It implies systematic treatment that covers not just isolated spots but rather involves moving attention over the entirety—or significant portions, as needed according to symptom location and extent within a finger or multiple fingers showing dis Take your love for the treatment of joint pain in hands to heart and apply with minimal effort only what you dare attempt here."

The English translation of the line from a medieval medical treatise is as follows: "It which concerns only those spices that come through venae [veins], according to what we have divided among diseases." This statement likely refers to understanding or categorizing specific remedies, possibly involving herbs and other botanicals (species), used in medieval medicine for their curative properties conveyed via the body's circulatory system. The context suggests a discussion related to phyt
The English translation of this medieval medical text is: "Cautery concerning the species that enters through dryness or by a paralysis of nerves." Here, practitioners are referring to methods involving cauterization – which might include heat application (siccacio)
The line translates into English as follows for a medieval medical practice: "When you cure that species of tortura by draining and bleeding (capipurgi), the patient does not relieve their suffering, so when you are performing cauterization on an illumination within them [the body], three kinds of lancets must be used for it: one made from gold filigree work, a small tool associated with your temple amulet (possibly implying sacred or healing significance), and the lips tied together by two fists.
And apply the pointed cautery on the contrary parts of the diseased area, where relief is not felt there until healed.
The method of cauterization is that you apply the cautery directly on the tip of the extremity' extruding pus, and in the temple area where it corresponds to its length, keeping your hand within so as much as can be burned for the quantity needed from the discharge originating at the chin joint.
This is the form of the cautery, and it belongs to the art of cutting instruments; this I present now. May there be subtlety so that one who is weak in their limbs may lie down, and when the excessive flesh of some takes a position undernethy: then place such moderately beneath them for support.

The text seems to be discussing the treatment of various conditions, specifically relating to a brain matter (likely meaning cerebral issues), during ingestion or at mealtime and mentions additional remedies for when excesses occur beyond normal medicine usage ("when the humoral imbalance exceeds medicinal measures"). The mention suggests that these interventions might be related to balancing bodily fluids, a concept from pre-modern medical theories like those found in Humorism. Here is an attempt at translation:
If it is an infant who does not suffer from the medicines, then administer purgatives and stimulants through their mouth for several days until digestion of foods improves (is good).
Return the head of the patient to its cavity, and apply a heating tool there according to the previous methodology; also use another cautery on their forehead, applying it over each part of the head as required by precedent, with additional cauteries used for various parts of the head. If the patient'thy humors are strong and tolerant, then you will apply that very cauterization to their body over the vertebrae of the back and those of the two (both sides), having paralysis and softening of the limbs as a result.
And if it is necessary for the pointed cautery (the olive one as previously mentioned), then use it next in its turn according to procedure order established earlier.

This line suggests an approach to treating skin lesions where controlled heat is applied through cautery and any loose debris or foreign bodies are removed before applying protective dressings like bandages as a preventative measure against further complications, which could reflect the medical practices of handling wounds with both removal (extraction) followed by protection during medieval times. The use of "malaute" likely refers to some form of heated instrument for cauterization and indicates an era where heat was used therapeutically in medicine before more modern surgical tools were available or commonplace, showing how medical practices have evolved from rudiment

Here you use fire cautery according to what one has been told about the necessary amount of heat required for that particular fistula—that's how much flame we need within its cavity; and place your hand inside so that this fiery instrument reaches down into where those ulcers are located, performing thus a healing touch or two. Afterwards take care as directed in our treatment plans until it has been sanitized (or recovered).
So if the illness is removed and healed, be content; but if not, it's necessary to discover whereabouts the disease has worsened within its cavity in order for you to hold back (treat) the corrupted bone as it appears.

When tooth pain is due to dryness or infection (or doesn't respond to usual care), then the treatment with caustics will be one of two methods as follows: either a cauterization at cow udder areas, or on focus." This passage suggests that if dental discomfort stems from certain conditions like dehydration ("dryness") or bacterial infection, and standard treatment is not effective (doesn't "comfere"), then the practitioner might resort to using caustic substances. They suggest two specific locations for this kind of cautery: around cow udders—a possible analogy to a
Cauterize the borders (referring to areas around cow udders) with iron and heating it up; wrap this over the extremity of a stick, and immerse that in contact border which has been singed by fire into warmth as well above where sore discomfort is felt inside within chewing." Here, an old practice for managing toothache pain involves using hot irons at specific locales (around cow udders), possibly a metaphorical way of referring to the healing or treatment area. The iron and its warmth are used in direct contact with these borders—perhaps indicating areas where inflammation is present, as indicated by "sore discomfort felt inside within chewing." It's an antiquated method involving heat application for pain relief related to dental issues before modern medicine was available.

If the dislocation is in those parts above and pain occurs therein through piercing or touching with a sharp tool used for cauterization, then seal over the muscle with caustic points of this specific type to confirm joint stability and expel humidity; thus healing takes place. (This translates into an intervention where localized pain is managed by applying targeted heat or chemical agents—cautery tools like cauterizing needles/piercing instruments are used here, possibly indicating a direct approach to address the joint dislocation and associated inflammation.)

Thus you will cauterize the wound over the joint's segment to resemble a small circle (meaning applying direct heat or burning technique at the specific location of injury), and by doing this, you should have secured it tightly around the place where it has been agitated/moved about. By controlling the temperature locally with cauterization, one ensures that bleeding stops precisely within the confines of a formed circle (indicating how localized treatment can help in managing and stopping hemorrhage).

De la cauterización del lepra." This line suggests that the context is about treating a condition
Some lesions require caustic treatment for significant healing forcefully applied and sparingly if the species of leprosy is caused by rotting flesh or melancholy." Here, it indicates that certain skin conditions (which could imply a form of infection like leprosy) may need more aggressive cauterization methods to promote healing. The treatment approach varies depending on the nature and assumed cause ("rotting flesh" symbolizing severe decay or necrosis; "mel
And when you intend to caustically treat that area, consider if the leprosy is involved and as healed by water previously mentioned in this division will not be required again or even needed today—nor does it concern itself with corruption affecting all parts of your body and its complexity. Caution here: on the head's crown (scalp), apply caustic where hair grows; above two points below, upon both knots; behind a nail bed [or spinal column], onto the nape or servant—two positions for application." This detailed guideline indicates specific locations and methods of applying cauterization treatments. The head's crown (scalp), areas beneath hair growth near bony prominency, back where there is evidence of corruption in formations like knots on nail beds or spinal columns are all considered for caustic application if leprosy and its after-effects are being addressed. The text prescribes exact locations—head crown (scalp), above two points beneath hair growth, back upon the nape/servit with respect to corns or nail beds; these instructions suggest a tailored approach for treating various affected body parts possibly due to leprosy while considering their anatomical connections and current state of disease. This reflective process emphasizes precise intervention at points where decay (corruption) is present, highlighting the medieval medical practice's meticulous care in addressing health conditions related to

The presence or absence of water is noted with potential implication about health statuses; 'water' could metaphorically refer to moisture, which might suggest poor circulation
They placed a dressing on the area where it was previously caultered in this limb's circulatory loop (or at its joint), or perhaps overlapping with previous burn wounds.

Whenever that irritant is in the place where you apply caustic application on a small stick of wood (or similar implied object), then light it as needed at that spot where the irritant resides." Here, the instruction suggests applying heat or fire directly to alleviate pain caused by an external corrosive agent.

Return the caustic treatment for that which is entirely within and thus remove completely all of the corrosion without causing any damage."

This line encapsulates
Apply it for three days over the caustically treated areas until scabs have formed completely and all signs of damage or remaining irritation are gone." This instruction outlines a treatment timeline that emphasizes persistence (three full days) to ensure thorough healing, with complete formation of protective scar tissue indicating successful eradication of both visible damages caused by the corrosive agent as well as any lingering effects. The comprehensive application ensures no residual irritation remains after treatment completion — a testament to medieval medicine's attention to full recovery

You understand that this illness moves slowly in children and occurs when the newborn first begins to cry its head hair out (i.dict "enfantment" as childbirth, with emphasis on the physical act of an infant emerging).
When there are some measures taken due to an infected cause that is not clean or pure (the impurities causing infection), then...
May you not see this illness in children but among those who have suffered hernia and death; and for aid I showed my work to these people.
Even you've seen that the child whose head was filled with water and which could not rest above its own head due to greatness of size, nor can it be bathed there because moisture has increased within where the focus lies dead;
This moisture is added between the navel and bone or added slowly on top of the flesh, respectively:
When the operation in that case is moisture between bone and flesh, and swelling occurs slightly at the head of the neck where there's a fissure located downwards along its length, this forms the ridge (spur):
And if the moisture is increased and the ulceration becomes more severe, here are two cracks according to this methodology.
If the moisture is in your nose, it means that you have opened up all parts of the head and water gets squeezed out when you compress that area with pressure; this is what happens to you now. When you cut into the spot of heat at the head and create three cracks according to this methodology:
Return the intestine to its cavity and press tightly on cracks in bedclothes and ointments; apply moisture above from wine and oil throughout the day, applying sling and care for wounds and bandages with little remaining humidity inside the body until it is comfortable and heals.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And observe that you do not separate the vein and outflow of blood, sanctus essence moving for the expulsion of moisture.
From the second inscription (or section) regarding these ar
When an obstruction or space occurs within the hips or chest and it is ancient (old), this situation cannot be addressed with traditional medicine; therefore, at the onset of these two arteries' condition lies their proper care.
And when you intend to insert those into the patient'thy head, and rub the hard part of the cloth where they will be inserted, and their collarbone under that piece of cloth; take note of the vein there as well; and over any spot covered by these instruments used for extraction, such spots are hidden in upright men.
Return the tongue over the arch of the foot where one stone has entered through a fracture in the skull and is entering into the mouth via its arteries, as directed by the head'se command:
If you wish, insert the splint into the artery and divide that portion for distribution at the parts below.
When the length of the intestine is two fingers adjusted, and when any vein in it expands due to effusion, causing a rising pulse frequency, here begins:
If the arrow does not appear at the joint, then measure the size of the artery with your finger and apply pressure to attempt arrest, inserting it into the mouth/throat:
When the body excretes its yellow fluid (sweat), do not let it exceed one drop, and all this is according to the quantity that appears from the malady of the sinews and the filling of the gallbladthyve patient's liver.
Return attention to the worms (referring possibly to parasites), and if there is any cause remaining within the bone, then divide it up here such that it does not develop into an abscess lickable by a caustic substance.
Return strength to the child with wool and silk clothes, and take care that it is within these garments where healing takes place.
Given that this medieval text is blending elements of Latin with other
The phrase "Capitol III." in the context provided seems to refer to a specific point or section within an earlier discussion, possibly about extracting arches from temples as described by medieval medical
When ancient cataracts arise due to moisture and the quality of stones within temples or when old ones appear suddenly like they do here, where our medicine's knife is necessary for treatment without discomforting them as we have demonstrated these illnesses—thus in such cases removal from temple arches becomes essential.
The pain during the operation and extraction of these humors that reside in the thighs is what we observe; understand it as arterial apparent on the temple when seen by your pulse, otherwise hidden but revealed momentarily through forceful movement (vomiting or straining).
If it is hidden, then tighten the hilt of your sword to any cloth; and rub or splash the location with an abrasive cloth or immerse in water until you see the arrow emerge. And when you take it, this is how he presents himself as a lithotomy instrument (spatula). Here comes the first source sentence for translation:
May it be that if the artery is subtle, you encircle it with this one around the extremity of the body part, and insert into that section according to the quantity by which their limbs are elongated and contracted; thus no flow will come from there unless they have not been inserted.
E reduce or reintroduce stool from the sanction of venesection into three times its normal volume within it.
If the artery is large, then cover it with wax in two places halfway down to where flesh meets bone and do not cut into living tissue during its congealment; this will prevent putrefaction inside the body and a flow of pus.
Return the excess that is between two ligaments, and apply it at this time or another time.
If you wish, apply the pointed cautery inside the mouth to close those external parts of it where incisions have been made, and remain at that place for the work done by this barber (or surgeon).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "It is better if inflammation of the spleen causes fever or complicated swelling; these are cauterizations for those causes that help with fluid accumulations, and therefore they are more beneficial in summer.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And apply pressure on the outflow of humors from their spleen area, ensuring that dips are properly placed there with medicinal ointments so as not to harm flesh and bones while healing occurs inside where it is sick.
While you work in other ways today to expel the phlegm from the artery, now is when you must tighten that phlegm, or apply a cautery there, and hold your hand firmly inside so as to restrict the flow of phlegm. If a cause of those things is not present with you now, then stop your tongue on the location where he has contracted himself, and brace that area because as long as there' extricate heat intensely within it, contraction continues until relief comes; when his strength returns.
When blood is drawn out of the vein at this location with a hot iron (cauterization), you have placed two towels there where you attempted and succeeded in blocking it off; after sufficient time has passed, enter until the blood reaches the bones above it so that it becomes elongated here due to all these efforts within which place is used for cauterizing.
This is how the cautery should be used:
And the sharpness of both pads is an example. Even if your wounds are inflamed and as sharp as the edges of any sore present in one's body, do not cut into the flesh with haste.
So when there is any thickening in them and heat accumulates at the focus, and the flesh separates loosely.
This work is better in its entirety and has been added ease (leugierie).
Whereas in those spaces between two belts is the quantity of the said bulkiness.
Capital Quart. (Assuming "capitol
Concerning the treatment of sharp and acrid humors in joints through their body.
When the acid humors accumulate and reside over those veins which are above the patient's chest bone, they do not suffer in any way from causes of medical treatment, and their face becomes reddened as if ambulating like ant worker bees, with their hair standing on end due to tear fluid; ancient midwives attend them during this operation, cutting off excess growth using sharp tools for the purpose of healing these humors, thereby completing that specific type of treatment.
When you command the malady to draw out the hairs in their face and place them three times at intervals on the lips according to the length of the forehead, it means: If the fissure' extrusion extends two fingers in length: one fissure is located above the nostril on the forehead spot where tears are made (tear duct), and another according to a small distance from the movement of the eyes, which parts respectively belong.
Guard your jaw from the opening of both lips and extend your neck to maintain continuous movement between both lower jaws. If there is an excess of three days' worth of space in any joint,
If there is an applied pad or dry cloth on them, where the ashes are deposited by him,
Return the spleen between two sharp limbs of which this is its form: That it is from the departure of spirits into the second insight. Excise all the tongue that is between two incisions on the bone where it covers the skull and let its humor move within into the second incision. Here comes the sentence to translate: Return the bed or pillow so that it does not protrude into either of its compartments; use a tool hereby referred to as cutting instrument for this purpose from one end and another, which are not cut by themselves.
E pause the flesh of that gout must be attached to its bone, and press it into where the migrating joint meets the skull, detaching all vessels from the head downwards along those veins.
May continued flow of humidity from the spine be directed into the middle crack between other cracks within oneself; place water there as desired.
When I apply sufficient quantity of sanctified water (sanctioning fluid), expel the hardened places in the thigh' extricated by coldness.
E apply pressure to any crack in the skin of a joint and place it over these granules that appear between flesh and bone here within body fluids such as water or oil, ensuring not for an abscess to develop underneasse.
In the third day, they untie and apply great heat from water or perfume to the wound, taking care that it is covered with oil of roses and others within which miasma (infectious vapors) are cured.
In translating this text from what appears to be an old medical language
The treatment of pus and the humors derived from the parts divided by the head involves purification or cleansing (catarsis). Here, "capitol" likely refers to something that has been isolated for examination in medical practice—possibly related to a specific body
When the pus undergoes purification or cleansing (catarsis), and sometimes these humors from within become exhausted, then attention is paid to them, with ulcerated eyelids and hides being touched by hand; in this place there emerges a sharp, intense pain deepening outwardly—this suggests that the materials for purification (catarsis) do not originate soles from veins of the divided parts proceeding but rather indicate some underlying issues. Here "alcu" may refer to an unspecified substance or fluid related to inflammation, and this text discusses clinical signs associated with medical conditions affecting joint pain in medieval medicine as influenced by humoral theory—where treatment focus is on balancing the body's four primary fluids (humors).
The best treatment for these is that you command the phlegm to rise up into its place in the head, and properly make an incision there at which point a small opening—wherein begins your tongue (and enters from left temple's inside space of right skull; entering bone), stretching with your hand whereby are contained teeth detritus. Here, it seems that medieval practitioners recommend addressing phlegm accumulation in the head by introducing a small opening for drainage and physically manipulating this area to release trapped impurities or "dental residue." The instructions here blend surgical intervention with therapeutic maneuver, illustrating an approach grounded both in physical principles of medicine from that era as well as the humoral theory.
Remove all phlegm or dry skin between the patient' extruding from either their navel wound, or on cloth covers; and fill these spaces with replenishing substances. And above it all are millet and oil poured down, in such way that the scald does not penetrate deeply into tissue.
When the fever and sweats have subsided, cover where it began in their navel to commence excising that which has caused them flesh-eating with this mixture of two parts flour from wheat and four parts beeswax, applying and administering as you take these plagues on.
Capitolo VI.
Of the treatment for what causes pain in the fingers (translation with context interpretation):
Every cause that resides in the fingers is one of four kinds: either it'thy mineral or like to stone; be it iron and glass, or plant such as chickpea (fava bean), barley, or water with its likeness—or some animal.
And when blood enters the earlobe or seems similar to those causes that do not fit in the earlobe and press against the sun, if you see it therein, then this may indicate some cause of impure oil or spleen disharmony; treat its removal accordingly, induce purgation (cleansing), apply liniments for healing, turn away colic due to expulsion. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If there is not an outflow, then administer the extraction using a small and refined tool that this represents.
If it is a blockage that has occurred (foreign body obstruction), then he does so; otherwise, administer its removal with gentle and repeated small touches of pincers.
And if there is not an obstruction (foreign body), then insert the arsenicum tube and place its extremity into the ulcer of the aureola, sealing it with wax and oil-softened so that nothing but the tube itself protrudes. Return (reduce) into its belly, where it is strongly attached, as have already reported the ones who came with us today.
May it not be an exit for this malady, then take hold of the wound or use the bellows at which their joints are pressed with some quantity, pause there and wrap carefully around that spot where they have been stopped. Return that into the fracture of the auricle and remove earwax for moisture.
So if there are all the causes we have described before, then you must apply heat or spasm as soon as possible to that which has just begun (the onset of an abscess).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When the figure of the moon has penetrated as far into the bone, and if that bone can be treated with your instrument at this moment, fix it hereby; also set the crack in there so quickly, and treat it within which time it becomes healed.
If the cause of pain is found in the artery and it has swolthy therein, then treatment and removal will be administered; however, if you do not heed my advice, take a gentle touch under this manner: e administer that which is taken from there of such a stone as was caught in his armpit,
Even when you think that it is already moistened by the steam of ardor and pause there in painful spasms, prevent those from drawing blood or causing subtle movements with your hands; for this will relieve them from leaving (the body).
May it enter the water in which the malady uses sternutation to expel phlegm from the body, and complete its healing at the patient's chest cavity; if by the water there is vomiting, then be sick (indicating a reaction); otherwise, take pearls and lion teeth according to the length of that pathway, roll them in one piece of cloth near the affected area, and have the patient insert this fabric into their trachea through the parted nostrgy. So that all of the water is drained from within it.
So that all of the water is drained from within it. And when the water rises at the entrance and you take hold of paper or horn, placing one end on the torchlight (hearth) and extending the other to ignite the fire within it,
Here comes the sentence in English translation line by line:
When an animal enters through that hole if it is a small creature, then may pull and make its appearance so as to look like the division we have discussed; but if it's from a large one causing trouble in the chest, administer the removal of said entity with forceps and knives, placing emphasis on removing this particular cause out of all others encountered at that hole.
When the evil vermin is born in the artery during extraction, and you do not comfort your treatment as discussed in the division and flow of distillations, then watch that when looking at the vein, it does not worsen under sunlight.
And so if there is any cause from worms herein present, extract it either through gentle touch or by means of a thin thread drawn up and outwards; otherwise take a hollow tube for this purpose. And insert the delicate extremity into the artery according to the amount that suffering may cause harm; and draw out venom with strong suction, doing so continuously until all the poisons have been removed from their bodies.
May you not obey my instructions, then you will become obedient and closed in the circuit of the catheter with wax inserted as we have discussed; administer these drips which have already been expelled during the treatment of old medicines, applying them to prevent their reabsorption into the tract.
If it is your flow that through which you introduce the medicines into this area with this instrument, E for that one of silver or lead is struck quickly in which there is a small fragment and placed on the chest.
Therefore when it is necessary in this state of continence at the tip of the catheter here, so be that as well (meaning they should proceed with caution or perform an action required due to being in this particular condition). If you wish, take the feather and wrap it gently around the patient'se limb decently, placing oil or honey in the cavity of breathing (chest), or any herbal decoction from these medicines within a syringe—and that is where to place your finger. Then insert your finger into below-the-chin level and express out what has been administers inside; as soon as you do, the patient with chest suffers will feel the oil being expelled internally through their throat opening (indicated by a bead on the necklace).
When humors have been infused into the auricle (ear), they are already cut by fire from one of its points, and another is serving on their legs or chest, holding their hands. When you consider what causes it that will be extracted in the oil lamp, remember that these ointments do not suffer from excessive heat.

In that moment when you pause the thread of the malady at the navel and look towards it, And if you see an obvious swelling above that subtle part which is this one of them, then handle it with care.
If the limb in which it is small has one sharp and the other not, and its socket consists of two lions' jaws to prevent injury to the head (auriga).
Therefore, if the swelling is due to raw flesh in the armpit or thigh area, then carefully cut and apply forceful incision within where it remains whole throughout.
If the swelling is in the area of the earlobe, then apply gentle heat and warm that spot with a small flame; place it where the swelling is on the earlobe.
And if the patient' extricates himself due to an excess of water that has been drawn out by external influences (gravities), this relief is oppression; watch therefore that it does not harm the nerves of his arms/hands.

The provided text seems to be in medieval Latin, which was used during the Middle Asian period for various writings including medical treatises. Here's an attempt at translation with some context added
The provided text translates to: "Movements wandered into the eyes' lids any cause that is assembled in its fortress and firmness; because of such great size they call it." In this sentence, a medical practitioner refers to swelling (grandissa) or inflammation within the eyelid structures ("fortress and solidity").

Translation: "Therefore, they are considered if the swelling is occurring in it (the eye) from moisture that appears underneath and everywhere due to dampness." Here, a medical professional discusses signs of ocular inflammation potentially associated with conditions leading to an accumulation ("maugudeness") or excessive fluid production beneath the eyelids. The term "leugiera" refers to wet (humidity), suggesting that moisture might be contributing to these symptoms, possibly pointing towards a discharge
Translation: "Therefore about that crack in the boundary (possibly referring to an opening or tear), and extract therefrom what is whole from all parts so you may escape it; also suspend herein for a moment, as well separate out those of nowhere found." This line might be describing post-operative care after addressing some kind of ocular discharge (possibly due to infection or injury), emphasizing the need for careful extraction and separation ("entero") of fluid elements from different parts around the eye. The term
If the figure is large, then adjust it with suture, and take care that it heals properly.
If it is little (or scarce), you will not come ill from that much anger left in him for another four days.
If the greatness declines at the parts of the eyelid'dicts, then lift up the lid and suspend its size for an hour or so, as you decide; proceed with this action on all areas, and if the eyelid by inspection is elongated, there is no cause to note.
And when you start treatment, wash with saltwater and care for the place where water resides inside to heal it.

From below the eye, in the underside of the eyelid where these grays are produced within its lining and mainly affect children; they worsen those hues thereof and prevent them from seeing sunlight due to their retention." This medieval text describes a skincare concern beneath the eyes (axcirnath) related to pigmentation in infants, which exacses discolorations. The grayish color mentioned is likely hyperpigmentation or similar skin irregularities specific to that area. It further notes these conditions make it difficult for affected individuals not only from seeing sunlight clearly but also potentially impact their overall health condition (mayti), implying some sort of systemic illness associated with the visual symptom and possibly suggesting a rudimentary understanding of causation or treatment options, such as light exposure to help alleviate these conditions
And now you've been talking about the skin on their cheeks all day long and at nighttime as well; over their moistened brows under which there is already inflammation covered by flakiness, suggesting an imminent infection within these areas where if you notice when they touch those spots inside them." Herein lies a description of skin concerns involving cheeks (les lors caras) and potentially problematic eyeshadow-like blemishes on brows. The text suggests inflammation has already begun, covered by flakiness or dandruff ("imflacio"), with signs pointing to an infection possibly exacerbated at night ('dormen') when the skin is likely more moist (hid) and sensitive after day-long exposure. The practitioner advises close observation for any symptomatic changes, especially upon physical contact by patients ("tu premes le loc am les tieus ditz"). This line

When in the palpebrae of our humors are naturally adjusted hairs, and thus ancient ways occur with tears that flow constantly and gentle manipulation or bandaging within where these might cause harm to the humor we touch upon; heal by means of: four methods - through cauterization using a sharp point (like surgical tools); as per acute medicines according to what is written in our book on caustics; via delicate extraction and suturing with skillful hands; or perhaps the use of canes, following your directive.
And so when you pause the head of the malady at the waist; take your left hand and grasp it over there (the mouth), if converted then I will be present here with you, else insert a needle into that place where their parting has been applied sparingly on the eyelid, make the needle penetrate undernethy skin at point of contact; draw back this thread to reach above it in places between the teeth, and convert (or tie) there with your left hand.
And in the part of the eye lid where hairs are adjusted with sponge inserted into the tear gland within the lacrimal major drainage system; and extract quickly both falsely made or woolen thread from under the eyelid, placing it on top for pressure, as well as a finger over the eye lid to try (possibly apply some form of gentle massage), while holding their hands.
Mayhaps when the figure according to how much eyelid movement there is, men differ in these matters too; for those who have a large amount of lid motion require more care inside the eye socket as it allows them greater mobility and fluidity (in reference to lubrication).

Whenever there is an excess of subtlety beneath the eye lashes that overflows from under the eyelid, tighten the cannulas of some cut parts at rigorous contraction, and leave it like this for a few days until the contracted area dies out and if denied so does not reappear within which time period the patient will self-treat.
If it is late, then break open (or tear) the leather and carefully place the poultice inside where it should be healed.

This illness that the term "alconati" refers to is not simply diarrhea, as it appears more likened to water flowing downwards in nature's course of action within one’thy body. (Here 'alconati' could be an old or regional term for a specific type of illness related to the digestive system that resembles liquid movement like "diarrhea," but with
The manner of treatment for this sickness involves emptying the intestines through an enclosed device and placing your hand over them with two fingers from both hands to prevent what lies within—the cause that enters at once, keeping it dry so as not to descend any further into those parts. And in doing so, ensure thorough absorption (or 'siccatura') without letting moisture pass through; this action stops the illness' flow and retains its essence therein for cure. Here one must acknowledge that whatever is within often enters with urgency as if drawn by a current or force of nature itself, signifying an acute process requiring immediate care to address it before further complications arise in those affected parts (translation simplifies the original text's intention and assumes 'alconati', while not defined elsewhere, refers to some form of intestinal issue that needs urgent attention).
If it does not fall into the lower areas (which could refer metaphorically or literally), then you understand—it is water still present within its course of action in nature's
If it is not prepared to descend into the sickness we have mentioned, then you know—apply pressure with a delicate sponge under that which covers above in our body's outer layer (the conjunctiva overlying cornea within the eyeball), and thus expel its presence from there; removing it completely. Herein lies an understanding of how to extract illness without further spread, particularly when dealing with eye-related issues where precise intervention is necessary—highlighting a treatment approach that may prevent or halt worsening conditions associated directly within the visual organ's protective sheath (translation interprets medieval medical instructions for managing ocular symptoms potentially linked to systemic diseases such as diabetes, which could present with eye-related manifestations).

When teeth are prominent in their natural shapes and mostly when they come out of the females' breasts (which implies nipple area), it is evident that tooth erosion cannot be ignored or treated with liniment alone; hence, root treatment becomes necessary—and this can only occur through dental procedures using Indian steel from a specific type known for its sharpness. Here, teeth are considered like pork meat and the appropriate instrument used herein resembles knife made of such metal to carry out extraction or removal if no other option is available (i.e., there's an abscess associated with another dental issue).
And if it is your intention that you insert therein for several days to alleviate the hardness of the teeth and not cause other damage than to the teeth themselves.

When the ligaments are involved, which we find in the tongue and forbid speech.
This ligament from which the tongue occasionally moves or is naturally attached to it, where a man does not feel (or an injury has occurred due to worms that have already set in).
The operation in the patient is to suck the malady'dictor (likely referring to blood or humor), its saliva existing within the bowels; raise your tongue, and inscribe that particular nerve according to where it resides inside their spiritual essence (body).
If there is any hardness or swelling in that area, and it's due to the consolidation of pus within, then take some oil and divide this into what you have previously cut with a ligature (bond), wherein its dissolvable substance has formed.
Guard your body so that there is not a crack in the flesh of the skin and split openly earth (phlegm) flow from sealant (cure).

In this patient it is time for an operation; crush the tail of the malady before sunrise and take into account the ulceration.
If you see him with a dark or black hue that does not lack feeling, do not touch that which he is crying out from the womb-like area (likely referring to his groin where an inguinal hernia might be present).

When extracting goosebumps and those that are nothing in the palm, as well as other such extruded pustules.
When gout attacks in the joints, these are the swolthy lumps that assemble therein, which harden and darken after drenching within division/separation; when you heal them, consider if it is an abscess of a black color, with little feeling sensation. Do not touch those limbs marked by iron (likely referring to pus or infected material).
If it is desired for the color and complexion to become thickened, do not touch that with iron through the flow of blood; let it stay within itself as long as possible, until you either lift it out or break it by yourself.
If it is of white or blue hue and its nature is subtle, then that one must be enclosed within.

The provided text appears to be describing traditional medical practices related to joint pain (possibly referring
Based on the fragments of medieval Latin-like language you've given, here is a possible translation for "Capitol .xxxvii." However
When arthritis sets into the joint (of a limb), it is deep-seated and longlasting—it has no perpend0739154628_link%C3%ADpcion en el cuerpo, thereforly named not for its position but because of where it occurs. And if the joint in question belongs to a large, round part (possibly referring to an organ like the liver), then they call it "the hump" ('buba').
When healed with the fluid that we have mentioned in division, do not hinder your treatment and continue to administer it frequently; if applied long-term or is bloody dark red or black (not from within), where you fear putting on such application internally because of concern over the area above thighs.
When you turn that secondly as dictated by the patient' extraneous whiteness and length, which makes up their form and fixes one-tenth in the new phase; take out this using either of two instruments from where it has been incised into the space between the knees (or groin), pulling it out here and there.
When what is not inserted therein but rather the one adjusted to its natural place comes in; if you insert into it at all, let your speech be lightened.
Return to the bladder and use this water which has been recommended for it within two months' time, taking care of that inside so healed (the patient).
If the groin was frightened by his ignorance during cauterization, and using of instruments is merely a drink of water quick (sharp), then you stop at the waist where it's located; place your tongue on that instrument which we have mentioned before, and with liquid from there to moisten this living thing. Also ensure that neither thick nor subtle will be applied here—thus completing its hollow form:
Such is the cavity of conquest where medicine rests with the handle of a razor blade and the instrument lies in its hands, so that saliva or muscle secretion from the mouth of this person does not enter into medication internally nor cause any harm to it. Hereby preventing anything internal causing discomfort at the joint (gout).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return your hand to its place in medicine, and express that which enters through the spaces of a meager hour within where it can be blackened and soothed by the bite of medicine.
If you wish, cut the wound and cover it with this over the extremity of the rod, submerge that bandage in medicine, place your ray on top of that which is attached to the tube so that it adheres therein; apply as much medicinal fluid as you desire for cauterization therapy. And once done (allowing three to four days), change this dressing accordingly.
If indigestion occurs during the practice of medicine, then repeat that treatment and apply cauterization within the limb'dictorium (a concept related to body cavities or channels), beginning at its entry point into the chest area; cleanse it with water from this source, bathe in boiled water, treat open wounds above, continue until healed.
This healing substance has been placed with care and for a considerable length of time out of fear.
Some times it is healed with water that has been subtly applied using cautery and incision, as in this remedy: mint, yarrow, rue, Arabic cloves, camomile, sage, lavender, and chamomile; all these herbs are placed into a pot. Everything is adjusted to deal with or some of the causes mentioned herein within the water'setup, which will be submerged in wine, boiled down until it becomes syrup-like: there should also be an implement made from silver (or another metal) for this method; either precious metal instruments are used.
And insert the limb into the mouth of the malady until the steam rises to touch the tongue and causes it to become dimmed.
Here applies pressure on that motion made while dry, and watch so you do not perform this treatment at mealtime; too much adjustment would worsen the apomission condition, but if necessary, apply it here under my supervision as a corrective measure (translation).
May it not be that you do not have this instrument present? Then take a can and make an enclosure outside of him with hemp to soothe the mouth of the malady, for the closure made from hemp prevents the fumes from burning the mouth.
This treatment is good for health.

The sentence, when translated into modern English while preserving the original meaning and context of a medieval medical text discussing treatments related to pains or thorns in joint areas ("guolayro" seems like an archaic term for "joint"), could read as follows:
Translation: Thus catch what comes to your eye from the joints or spines and place it in front of you with tongue as an implement; thus will you declare whether there is fluid within that area (possibly indicating a condition like gout). Here, "guolayro" can be understood contextually as referring specifically to painful areas such as joints. The translation retains the procedural aspect typical for medieval medical texts on extracting visible signs and diagnosing conditions using direct sensory experience—in this case with sight ("le vista") supplemented by touch through a tool, which could
Translation of the complex medieval medical text: May take a snake and bind it with faithful rope, or may place cushions on the table and extract them therewith; alternatively, use a pot and apply its heat to remove (the humors).

And if it is a large tumor that enters from outside its cavity, which you introduce into the patient's mouth for ease of treatment,
And lift his head upwards on it, and make sure that the touch of your hand is not to its throat or spine, as desired by the doctor for this purpose.

When bloodsucking occurs in the division of healing as per medicine and should not be permitted, consider that it happens within the marrow bone to the skull; hence you must acquire your tongue for use with this very tool which has been recommended by us.
So if you feel a sudden or subtle swelling in the region affected by gout (the sanxiguisuuga refers to joint pain due to uric acid crystals typically associated with gout), extract that small part carefully and adjust it delicately.
If it is not possible to extract from there, then take a concave cannula and insert that into the hollow of the malady, placing your finger on the indentation of the cannula where the mercury has been ignited (so long as the sycical substance remains dead and stays within the cavity), preventing it from leaving throughout the day.
Here comes the translation:
If it is not a fever caused by the water we have applied internally, then blow away or apply heat to the abdomen with this same tool used for vaporous application in humidifying coughs.
When it (the condition) occurs in this way, or when they experience pain herein mentioned above, let them rest and lie
Another maneuver in the process of suction (or absorption) that involves burning carboh0ids within an enclosed space and using this to compress it into another container where there's a breach, while keeping your hand below the area being treated; then placing your mouth on the end of the cannula so as not to accidentally suction inside through which you know that absorption has been achieved in the surgical site.
If not already doing so, then repeat the subfumigation movements, and refrain from drinking malady (illness), eat salted and acidic foods (like pickles and sour fruits), avoid water intake if necessary; for these actions are required to adjust this regime.
This is the form of the tool by which one extracts pus from an abscess when seen; it resembles forceps used sometimes but without any curvature herein. The given medieval medical text translates to English line by line as follows:

May some of which have not been pierced but are properly developed due to illness in those places, and these may be extracted here.
So others are those which become dislocated when they're crossed and aren'thy not mature according to their complement; similar appendices that belong to joints, where an appendage becomes attached to a joint while water circulates within its circuit, damaging the ligaments or nerves of that joint. If it perforates in such case before becoming ripe inside another limb (prosthetic member), it causes rupture; if not yet mature and you pierce it at this stage, there will be no digestional completeness here but rather the one belonging to the anus, stretching into the parts of that body segment while forming a fistula. And where such perforation occurs outside its natural state (not in place), resulting not only from lack of proper evacuation but specifically when it comes from the area related to excretion and becomes elongated towards the segments at the end part, causing an abscess or pain that remains unhealed within this body segment. May you know the time of the incision for the abscess drainage, and so it is when it ripens.
You understand that the pain and fever subside when they cease to occur, and you decrease restlessness and pulsation; strengthen the head of abscess rupture, along with other symptoms.
And when you know where the incision for cleaning out abscess and purulent discharge from treatment of inflammation is located, do so accordingly:
Perforation is done through the length of the body or limb, in parts of muscles and feet, as well as locations of joints, nerves, veins; and finally, everywhere rigid areas where there'thy no reflection occur—these are used according to their respective part.
May it be when the abscess is in the flesh, then we must perform its incision while confirming that digestion has progressed sufficiently according to what have said; if you pierce this at that time, the leg of the patient and their joints become sore and hardened by dull sounds, as well as the thickness of their lips.
May an incision be made according to the flesh's or body part'dict needle, or as dictated by which member requires it most urgently.
When you administer a small puncture, and large or wide incisions according to the size of the instruments used for these procedures.
Other remedies for when the censor is constricted and cut (likely referring to an anal dilatation or treatment), at which point bread enters as if it sticks, likewise with that causing acute discomfort in blisters and swellings; all while holding their hands.

From those joints wherein is administered a round and moon-shaped pill, they seem similar.
May those who cannot bear with surface horn appendices not be pierced by that which penetrates them only superfishily or flatly.
When the abscess is large and has collected pus already, do not attempt to extract it all at once here; take out some of it now from that place, and tomorrow apply a greater part, taking care each time more until completely removed (drained). They have extracted parts today from there, applying larger portions daily, gradually increasing the amount taken as directed.
Mostly if the malady is from excessive yellow bile or phlegm in women, infants, or old people, for their spirits move towards exit of illness and they expire due to this condition; then you perform operations on them.
1. Guard thy great care, and place your puncture in the instrument where you pierce these warts, so as to avoid catching diseases; then consider whether the disease of the wart is small or flat, at which time administer such remedies for it that belong either to old medicine or current treatments. If the wart is large and there are fissures in your puncture site, cover thy hand each place where they come together within these intervals so we may not become sickened ourselves.
If in the abscess it has detached a part of the colon or if that area has been hollowed out within the circuit, then cover it with cloth wound bandages immediately when you have taken away pans or broken things; and strengthen its moisture so that it enters into the third day, at which time treat what flows from those swelling.
If you experience a flow of blood during your operation, then administer cold water and compress these where the cloth is placed on the site of continued bleeding.
If the flow of blood persists, then when you attend to regimen and care, and apply these recommended powders in places indicated by this very book and division.
In case of winter, and the location of ulceration is a place where nerves are compressed by dust and oil applied with caution, apply these over the locations to relieve them.
If it is summer and the places are fatty, then when you take breaks at the beginning in water and oil as before we spoke about, this will happen every day until healed, and while doing so make sure to cut away the apostema (abscess) and cleanse that area for his treatment.

Translation of the sentence "Capitol .xlii." into English, considering that this could refer to a section from an old medical text (possibly using Roman numerals),
The sentence "Motas veguadas endeveno aquestes apestaem entrem el colon (col), entre els asellhes (anus) i als anguinars; e algunes vez acontecen encara per les altres parts de lthy." when translated into English, conveys the notion that these blockages or 'apestems' often occur in the intestines and anal area. Additionally, some instances of such occurrences can still happen within other body regions
The sentence translates into English as: "These are those that cause inflammation in the colon (col), and these blockages themselves; they all take place within their own clothing layer, just like head lice between our hairs where we find nits stuck together." This suggests a medieval understanding of how diseases or issues could be internally related to personal belongings, such as one's clothes. Here the 'nostra tunica propria,' refers metapnocally possibly to linen garments that can harbor infestations similarly observed with head lice and nits (lice eggs). In this context, it implies how pests or diseases might be transported through clothing contact which could lead to in
The sentence translates into English as: "These are the spices of these blockages; some are stone-like and contain moisture within them, and others that do not succumb to treatment." Here 'species' refers possibly to different types or characteristics (properties) of blockages.

So when you have good disposition in the treatment, wherein the color of what is shown is similar to that of the navel and mottled throughout the entire body without being attached at the backbone or veins, nor along arteries, nor protruding like swelling which requires those parts for insertion above mentioned lines C. into line B., observe all over the partition as seen hereinabove detailed with small forceps below each nostril and lips of the navel if necessary at this point in our discussion (similar to what we have done in the mouth).

Translation: "From those containing moisture; and from those sealed within the lunar line (between points G and B); remove all that is inside to treat lice infestation, then cover it with woolen cloths for re-entry on other days." This medieval text provides instructions likely regarding a treatment process where one needs to carefully extract elements of moisture or sealed matter within the lines marked by points G and B (perhaps these are specific measurements in some form). Following extraction, covering it with wool is recommended before returning for further intervention on other days. The passage underscores an approach that involves precision removal followed by protective measures using natural materials common to medieval medicine practices. It implies a cyclical or progressive treatment methodology tailored around lunar phases as denoted in the points G and B, which may indicate specific times for medicinal preparation according to traditional beliefs about moon cycles affecting health outcomes at that time of writing ("autra dia").
Translation: "Then cover it with appropriate wax and let it heal inside." The sentence advises applying an apt amount of wax as a form of treatment for whatever has been previously described (presumably the extracted material from within points G to B). This method assumes that by sealing

The eminence of the navel is painful due to causes such as fissures in which fluid or pus flows according to other ruptured areas; or because of constriction sickness wherein blood vessels and arteries are affected, following what has been stated here. Additionally, it could be caused by a hernia that protrudes into the body cavity (belly), requiring attention with linen/bandage as indicated for other ruptures; or due to collapsed cerebral circulation where blood flow is impeded within the skull structure mentioned earlier.
If there is a crack in the chest and through the veil of flesh, then the color of the ulceration resembles that of the body; it causes great pain like a lion'thy different situations.

If the prominency of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or membrane, then order the humors that hold it so tightly and keep it extended; also give command in all parts around the navel where you have touched with your hand, and make sure everyone there between one's hands remains upright over their own body position. Moreover, surround these areas within the circuit of the umbilicus along the spot where touch was made with a cushion or bedding; likewise direct those parts to lean backward towards each other above it (the navel). Also extend the prolapse part by moving them inwards at their joints and position hands over, as well as commanding fingers of oneself on either side below. Direct that feet be firmly planted with strong or yieldable ankles within one's circuit around the belt line (abdomen).

In English: "We already have recommendations in the division of aquatic herbs and their essential oils for healing by water," indicating that there are specific uses or preparations involving waters with added natural elements (aquatic plants) believed to offer therapeutic benefits. Here, individuals recognize both plant-based ingredients typically used within a medical context ("specias de ydropici" meaning "herbs from the sea") and their extracted oils as part of healing practices that involve
Translated: "It is not the iron alone that heals it (the condition), and certainly not approaches to treat with tin or sea spray; for these are deadly." The text suggests skepticism about traditional remedies involving those specific elements, possibly referring to outdated medical practices where harmful substances were misguidedly used as treatment. Here the writer emphasizes that true healing comes from "althi" (a term which could correspond with alchemical concepts or herbal medicine) and not these dangerous methods believed at one time by some practitioners
Translation: "When you have treated this sea herb medicine for the ear and your remedy is complete without using iron, then consider whether dew has been obtained from it at all or likewise in our world; if so, guard against applying these to other illnesses beyond ears—in body parts such as belly or face—and you must not use them with metals. Fear comes because of this." The text advises caution when dealing with sea herbs and their remedies outside the treatment for ear conditions, highlighting a potential concern regarding misuse which could be harmful if applied to different parts of the body using metal tools or objects—a reflection on historical medical superstitions where certain treatments might have been thought incompatible. Here "aldi" indicates past achievement ("al malaute ja es conseguida debelitat"), and there is an underlying warning against extending such sea remedies to other diseases, suggesting that doing so could result from a misguided belief or fear—possibly referencing historical taboos around mixing elements considered incompatible.
If you again find the thigh excessively full of vitality, and this is not another illness but simply overabundance, neither woman nor child will suffer from it if you raise your leg between yours and express the abdomen in its place with your hand, draining the water immediately at the joints' departure, and applying pressure using prickly sponge as follows:

May that from which he is stricken be treated with iron as we have said, for up to four days until it is exacerbated.
When these are not in their proper place and cause distress among them, the reason is that they arise from above the waist due to weakness of its bone (pelvis), causing an elevation upwards into those parts below; it's neither nature nor generation as such causes miscarriage according to natural reproduction. It results in a serious illness caused by these abnormalities, preventing them from urinating at the lower body segments due to their displacement above and obstructed passage downward (likely referring to reproductive or urological issues).

Circumcision is not solely about continuity of treatment like other diseases: however, with our operation and willful intention, we must assign in the best possible intervention for their salvation—and it shall be done through these children properly as part of that caregiving. It implies a sense of responsibility towards providing effective medical attention to male infants undergoing circumcision beyond mere procedural continuity; such an approach is considered essential and carried out with dedicated effort, ensuring the health benefits are achieved specifically for those young patients in need. This statement underscses not only compassionate care but also a proactive role of medical practitioners to select what they believe will yield optimal results (salut) through appropriate interventions aimed at infants requiring circumcisio, highlighting the moral and professional obligation
Thus, it is said that the ancients did not perform circumcision on free men within their territories because they didn't use laws to mandate such procedures and were instead relying only for experimental purposes—hence why most of the craftsmen and barbarians resort exclusively to leather cords (liament am fiel) or ivory pins (inscizio am la ungla), tools not typically associated with this practice. This implies that before modern medical instruments became common, those performing circumcisions did so using what they had on hand—materials often found outside the traditional scope of surgical equipment and methods for such a procedure at the time. The mentioning of these materials also suggests an improvised approach to neoteny (mundo fi) with limited resources during ancient times when medical practices were less established than today, highlighting both resourcefulness in face of scarcity but possibly questionable standards by contemporary assessments due to lack of specialized tools and a scientific understanding.

We have discussed the stone in which operation is performed and its sequence." (This line likely refers to a particular medical procedure or treatment involving stones as outlined previously within the context of traditional medicine being practiced.)
The stone that is formed in the bladder itself is precisely where it remains in the bladder." (Here, there's a focus on stones originating specifically within the urinary bladder – these are retained or present directly inside this organ.)
He tells that story which is manifest and abbreviated." (This line suggests a concise recounting of some kind, possibly related to medical treatments or observations involving stones as discussed earlier
So it is said that the stone formed in the bladder mainly affects children (or perhaps 'infants'); and from my body, urine escapes through its channels - appearing like water due to their subtlety - within this sand; and when a malady inflames its spine with heat strokes, beating motions are used for treatment. Moreover, an incision is made here in the forum of these troubles." (This passage details that bladder stones often impact children – possibly implying smaller patients or infants who might suffer from such conditions due to their developing bodies and physiology.) It continues by suggesting urine flows through fine channels within a metaphorical 'sand,' indicating possible blockages, which require intervention. The description of treating the spinal inflammation with beats hints at an ancient therapeutic practice involving manual manipulation or physical force applied to treat certain medical conditions (possibly relating to urinary tract obstruction). An incision is then mentioned as a treatment method within this specific context, which seems relevant for addressing the 'trou
And it is the cleaning of children within that age who have achieved twelve years, and difficult care in their limbs. May in young people move for this reason among them.
From that from which the stone is larger and cautery less gentle; if it is scarce, contrary to that.
So when you reach the treatment of that, cover it with a cloth from which we extract out all through the hole whereby they enter into their belts; this gap sometimes prevents the impurity entering thereof and being investigated upon them.

Return they into its bedroom; this is how it enters here: and divide the water between the knee and thigh joints here below in this place (between the left knee and hip), not on the spot where heat accumulates there; that section is placed over it, forming a transverse section so as to make its width broad for better drainage according to what seems possible from under the area without exceeding, since one cannot remove more of the flesh than present in the joint located below (in the knee), and when this becomes necessary.
E understand that there is some stone in the body from which it becomes difficult to heal because of its water content.
From that water it appears as if a lion has grazed upon it and is round in shape; its yellow bile requires examination by the physician.
Then adjust it in the crack.
If there is not a cauterization tool available, or if you decide to use one that sharpens on the area where it touches, apply this with care upon the limb of which it rubs against; do not run away from here—instantly introduce another delicate instrument for curving the extremity.
Mayhaps if you cannot cover that area, then increase the disruption slightly and if you see a flow of pus, separate it with strong vinegar wine which has been triple distilled.
May it be that if the stone is in one place, then lead your hand to its mouth (the entrance), and press over it; also take something small with you, as though they are pains of diseases.
If it is heavy metal within you that causes the great section to become painful, ignorance leads one who has inserted this large piece into your flank; for either because it remains or due to its continuous urine distillation, then that place is not fully consolidated.
May you administer the removal of it from inside that has been extracted or within a broken bone, using those tools inside where they extract it out in pieces.
So when you have completed your treatment, then fill the wound with aloe and dragon'dict plantain, and strengthen it. Pause over that linen steamed with oil and vinegar or water moistened with lye allows the caustic to subside safely.
Return the intestine above the belly onto its cavity and do not let it out through the ligaments within three days.
When that air escapes, apply water and oil here within so that it is healed inside.
If in the soil an abscess is cauterized and softened/decayed, like when your sanction (spleen) is congelated within the bladder, then insert the thread into the dirt and remove that slander, for it may cause the bladder to corrode further along with its putrefaction.

From outside the womb (uterus), gout settles in a pipe (fistula).
Return your faith promptly, and hold it in place on top of the stone for that it does not return to the bladder.
Return the iron into the wound with ease until the perforator injects its contents to that particular stone (the foreign object causing pain or obstruction). Here is the line by line translation of the medieval medical treatise text:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return your hand over what has been broken off from the bone of the departed part below the knee joint; where that is fractured and a hole (perhaps due to urine leakage), cures the swelling.
If this treatment is not available to you for any reason that I have forbidden from it, then take a finger quickly and place it on the stone (i.dictate its use), and another underneath the rock (for support). When you place it between the bones in that area of inflammation. Return it externally (or take out that which is outside), then place your hand over Then release the ligament and purify the swollen joint with it (in the dirt). This implies that in medieval medicine practices mentioned here, a remedy might involve physically manipulating or treating an affected area directly by handling materials found outside—possibly using natural resources to alleviate
It is not necessary to use the patient's bone as fasteners for the stone (i.thyroid gland), but rather to prevent its return back into the urinary bladder, and another ligament below does so only when it has been removed from above; once taken out by that means, the cord returns to where it belongs and takes up in the dirt again. This suggests a specific therapeutic approach: after treating or removing certain elements (likely referring to surgical intervention), other ligaments are used as hold-backs until further treatment is complete; when they're removed, what remains returns its proper place ("retorna") and naturally reintegrates into the body. This could
When it is necessary to lift the bone upwards (probably after surgical manipulation), you must raise or restore its position in that area downward—returning what was removed with your intervention, which aligns with our earlier understanding of returning something 'home' through physical therapy. This passage outlines a procedure where medical professionals would intervene directly to correct the anatomy (moving bone fragments into their proper place) following surgery or other invasive treatments and ensuring that any displaced elements return, metaphorically speaking, back home

If you find a stone among those things, it will be difficult for him to recover from this condition, and such treatment is forbidden by excessive manual manipulation.
The one among them is a woman strong in her veins.
When it is not that you find a woman skilled who removes stones from the doctor when she goes to him or comes out of them (referring possibly to obstetric practices), then:
The clear woman has not yet learned this art; mainly it concerns surgery at home.
And the fourth reason is that the location of the section over the breastbone in women' extruded position extends beyond the place of the breastbone itself; hence there is a fear before detaching it.
If it is necessary to induce urination, then take hold of a female medical student' extricated from her studies and gently stimulate the area without causing discomfort.
Might you lack it (the instrument or tool), then seek a skilled midwife present in the marketplace of women'dictors, or someone competent from this division who can assist with such matters.
So take that present and command it to fix all the fluid you give him/her, from inquisition about her womb up until menstruation; this causes a desire if she is virginal or wishes for sexual intercourse at the base of their body (belly).
Then if you have abused it (the patient), restrain that part of the body where they are hurting and command them to lie down on that area.
If it is not a vein that we see (mays si non es verge), then the matrona commands to thrust her tool into the cavity of the swelling and place it over the bladder, ensuring she keeps her left hand on the bladder. Also procures good compression with whatsoish hands are provided for such a purpose (e comprem aquella am bona compression).
Thus, if it becomes too heavy for her to bear that which overflows from the bladder into the body parts on either side of where she entered at high volume within herself until reaching the pelvic area.
Return the instrument inserted into that position of the patient's body at their sitting place and center it on that division; do not move it from there until done by you, doctor.
And the section is little for consumption; and insert the thread over that section, if you feel pain, adjust it according to the amount which indicates how much the flesh has been pierced by that.

And thus will their illness be resolved quickly. Return care to the womb (or uterus). In this context, it likely
And when the sharpness of pain has subsided over aroused days, and the location returns to where work can be carried out, then you return to your task while the discomfort is gone/reduced. In this context, it suggests that once acute or intense symptoms have lessened (possibly referring to a medical condition), one may resume their duties as long as they are no longer feeling significant pain in the affected area ("the location"). The mention of returning "to your work" could imply restoring normal activities and responsibdictions that were put

A hernia is merely an addition of moisture in the white cheek wherein lies part of the intestine contained within it; and so they call this 'cheek.' In English: A hernia consists simply of excessive accumulation or retention of fluid inside a section referred to as "the cheek," which houses parts of the intestines. Here, "cheek" likely denotes an area where tissue has protruded outward due to this condition—a
At times it is in the panniculus (adipose tissue layer) where nature intervenes within that portion of fat which already exists; and this refers to a specific area between the cheeks as previously mentioned—the place from where we have identified, but actually consists only of tendons. In English: Occasionally, changes occur in the panniculus (layer of connective tissue or subcutaneous layer) within that part of fat already present; this concerns an specific region between the cheeks as noted earlier—the area from which we've pinpointed and is not just adipose but predominantly tendons. Here, it seems to address a situation where there may
The generation of this hernia is through expulsion that reaches the kidne extrinsic parts (genitals), causing these substances to be discharged therein; and some are even forced out by a painful thrust upon them:
This moisture has motion and changes colors: it may turn yellow or reddish like citrine or blood-red, black as tar or white as milk, which is what we observe most frequently.
And for the joints where this addition of water is concerned: if it' extricated from here (the basin), then let healing take place over a long bath with its shape like hawthorn, and show forth vitality; when humidity reduces throughout all parts.
If moisture is present in the patient's pancreas, then an abscess forms there and subsequently leads to another disease as perceived by him/her.
If there is moisture between the navel and the white line of the intestines (which may refer to a specific anatomical landmark), then touch it gently with one'thy hand.
When you wish to know the color of humidity (which in itself indicates what form it will take), observe the place where moisture accumulatin', and when sickness enters therein; accordingly look at that which has entered within your body, said doctor.
So when we come to the treatment of him who is in love with his malady (i.dict here referring to someone obsessed or consumed by their illness), if it's within your capability, perform an operation on what you identify as phlebolith(a type of blood-related bump which may be a sign of venous problems). And sometimes apply pressure to the belly area.

Excise that, and observe it carefully so as not to reinsert it; your excision will be where the humidity may rise but is subtly monitored through your examination of the excision according to what you can possibly perceive.
Return through puncturing the bladder filled with water, and extract all the water completely.
Here's the line by line translation: Here is the line-by-line translation of the medieval medical treatise:
If during that hour of your operation the tool protrudes from the patient's belly button, then return it immediately and adjust the lips of the incision on the navel of the genitals if they are sutured together, taking care to do so as with other creatures until healed.
If you have corrupted the humors through another illness, then cover with vessels that support the suspensorium and extract the humor therefrom; take care of it as we've discussed.
May if water is added in any parts of the body, you will realize that these are hernias; therefore, inspect this part wherein you have previously felt discomfort elsewhere on the body; and if it appears to be an operation for me, then perform it.
Return the sinew and let it enter into soaked wool dipped in oil or vinegar; hold back with another piece of such wool that you have submerged in wine and oil, spreading this over two knees and between my ribs. Then rest your hands undernedicted linens folded and pulvethen, lacing these through the leather as per this manner:
And take two pressed linen wraps following this likeness; they are bandages for the extremities of those whom you must bind or wet with moist lint, and their application is arranged along the waistband of the trousers, one foot wrap at the groin area inside, another around the genital part above it. The entire binding configuration is adjusted to fit within the waistband of the pants.
And when this hernia is treated artificially with pointed cautery below the site of fracture using a delicate pointed cauterization instrument inserted into its intestinal canal where there's water contained in what we call white bladder, and then you take it according to this method: e it is assembled in Greek letters.
When it is necessary to make an incision in that part of the body where there's pain and fire inside (indicating inflammation or a hot spot), then all the moisture will be drained out.
Return the incision open, and scrape it with sharp cautery instruments; do so carefully until you have removed all of what is there within your reach; keep yourself away from where the flame touches.
Be aware that this operation is put as a salvation and placed far from the flow of blood, which is better than an incision.
May it happen that if you cause an abscess to burst during drainage or treatment with cautery (caut en la hora de seccio o en hora de cauteri), then when the wound heals, which is what has happened for your care.
May the patient be afraid if there is a groin pain and they do not hope for the second operation due to its horror, administer puncture as I recommend; when you have done so, it must then be confirmed that this hernia is protruded (swolgy).
When you make an incision in the patient'dict vein raised above their shins and puncture the abscess at its lower part of the thigh bone (femur), cease cutting as dictated by the length of the wound.
And there is a wide opening where I pour out all the water.

The text provided appears to be medieval Latin, and it discusses the concern of losing one's limbs in dealing with hernias—a potentially grave issue at that time due to limited medical knowledge and interventions available. The author suggests observing removal (likely surgical) from this condition as a means for survival or recovery ("esser salvat"). Here’s the translation line by line:

Therefore, if it is their flesh that has become solidified in those parts, then take out what you have dug up and inserted therein.
If there is attachment due to any cause of the chirp (a term that might refer to an infection or inflammation), or between what flows through vessels, then you must release all such attachments and insert them using a round incision.
May it be the natural state of meat in the place behind where there is located, then insert all that you have from here and remove its humidity with water as we have discussed.

This line is in Latin, which was commonly used during the medieval period for various scholarly and scientific texts including medicine:
In English: The appearance of this intestinal hernia is due to a section within the stomach that has been stretched out above our organs (stomach), and when these pulses from such expansion reach up towards them, indicating rupture or protrusion.
This rupture is either of the cistern or exacerbation of it, and you worsen these organs' conditions due to various causes: pressing, thrusting, shouting, raising any severe cause, or pretending illnesses.
Et when the patient'thy fluid (water), as it is drawn out through contraction of his body, becomes scanty for a long time and does not supply him with sustenance, he suffers from putrefaction within himself in which you find poison entering into his bowels.

In treating syphilis in men there are two approaches: one is where they appear waterborne (implying transmission through sexual contact), as it manifests between the scrotum, presenting with a chancre that resembles a female's genitals.

The text is attempting to describe some concept relating gender and medical conditions, likely within a historical context that doesn’thy clear modern biomedical terminology but suggests the intertwining of physical characteristics with those belonging typically only to one sex when considering syphilis symptoms or manifestations in men—this may allude metaphorically rather than literally.

If it is for the purpose of treating headaches caused by apoplexy (stroke), there should be no harm done in any manner through a needle, which concerns only those who dare with such instruments recklessly.
The provided text is primarily in an archaic version of Romance languages with some unique
This line appears to be from a medical treatise discussing the treatment of hemorrhoids and possibly other vascs related conditions in women, potentially referring to varicose veins ("botor"). The text is likely written using an archaic form of Romance languages influenced by Latin. Here's a translation into modern English:
This line translates to: "Hemorrhoids appreciated within the openings of swollen veins, where flow continues constantly from those areas; and as for old hemorrhoids and are thus formed." This translation attempts to preserve both meaning and original medical context while using contemporary English. It discusses chronic conditions related to blood vessels in women'thy
Here the line translates to: "And I have spoken in this division of these and their senses; directing those that receive care towards me as well as those who do not." The sentence appears to be from a medical treatise wherein the author is differentiating between patients based on whether they are receiving treatment (care) or not. This distinction could relate directly to therapeutic approaches and patient management in medieval medicine, which often varied depending upon individual needs and responses to care provided by healers at that time
This line translates to: "Thus I declare that hemorrhoids and varicose veins when they appear in the private parts of a woman but do not present symptoms, are not treated as illnesses." This statement implies an understanding from medieval times where certain conditions were acknowledged without immediate treatment if no discomfort or negative sensations (sentiments) prompted concern. The translation captures both medical observations and considerations regarding when intervention was deemed
When those are on which mother'thy touch acts upon them, they are such that have been healed by her intervention.
When you put the woman into moisture and extend her legs or dress them in stiff cloth, and trace those areas with needles, it means:
And apply powder on those drippings from one of the inscribed wounds with ashes and similarity to them for these things.
Return your feet into pillows for an hour, and apply pressure on that part in cold water.
If the flow of bile persists, then it will accumulate in a vessel formed by suet and gravels from millstones and gemstones, holding together their blood'dictions.
And apply flour and honey, mixing it with water, making an ointment to spread over the two of them (presumably referring to a specific body area).
If the sanction has detached itself, it bleeds; and if not, rub on both sides of its nostrzyms (nipples), and perform scraping at these areas where the blood comes out.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Return wool and immerse that part of the colonic or arsenical sulphur, which has dissolved in water, adhering it here; apply care so that its cavity is lubricated within while being healed.
And take care of that within which is healed.
Given that "Capitol" does not provide textual content for translation in this

When spicy worms and various kinds of excoriations, sores, ulcers, haemorrhoids (swollen veins in the rectum), erosions, fistulas, bleeding piles, and other types of lesions occur due to lashing or piercing by parasites in the abdomen. You have already spoken about these diseases and their respective cures in this division.
Here comes the sentence to translate: When you dig out in this tract of abscess that is present when doctors examine those who are sick with it, and if you want to know how they perform their operation using iron.
And when you consider that the pain of apendicitis in their abdomen is stabbing and accompanied by fever, if this pressure on the feeling prevents from perforation within which period the inflammation subsides, then treat with water as it helps until the reduction of symptoms.
And when you make circles on the woman' extraterrestrial stone that gives out stones; and lie down on your back with your feet positioned according to the part of her abdomen where she delivers, spreading her hips wide apart, pause for a while between contractions until labor pains come.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And restore back the matrona'dictly and administer the tool by which it was opened for her mother; that form will arise in those cases wherein she must act.
When you intend to administer this tool into the womb of a woman'dictor (assumed 'the patient'), only what is in the wand and leader should enter there, nothing else from the instrument itself. May it be that the tool is larger than the patient's skin, then you should pause pebbles on top of the surface of the patient' extrusion to prevent the entire instrument from entering into the patient's body.
When you pause the flow that runs in the instrument below and hold it with your fingers, turning over what is overflowing inside until it reaches the level of the patient'dict mother’s container.
When excitement appears and it touches the hand and body with fire and moisture, then cover that area immediately with a linen pad under the head for support using a splint (sprain).
When the illness is cured, then you should pause in wet earth or oil immersed therein where any wound has healed; and stop bleeding in the section of the belly before birth.
Pause away from the mother and over the clean wool padding immersed in water where they are boiled:
Return it is healed in two days with wax that has been warmed, so long as the body remains cured within this period of time.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the patient has a swelling in their inflamed breast (breastfeeding or mastitis), you should not attempt to drain it yourself as this could worsen whatever care they have been receiving thus far ("that which we provided for them").
The provided text seems like an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise discussing conditions
To interpret and translate this line, which appears to use archaic language similar across the phrases given (with Spanish influences as "nosotros" is present), here's a possible translation into English:
Necessary cause is that the matrona examines the figure of childbirth by her breath and when she exhales at parts briefly to smell the air around her, which happens over there (the abdomen), where it belongs; this causes haste in preparing for labor, knowing well that this part represents a second natural figure, and its examination is above one's head, while another hangs or dangles from the umbilicus.
So when you handle those limbs, ensure that the patient'sin belly is compressed so they can breathe through their head while giving them the second treatment, and have it cleaned from any excess moisture for proper purification.
May that which is not natural and unbearable come to be on your feet or under them; when you are seized above the head of yourself or between the legs, with its weight upon you too, whether it lies on top of yours own body or atop the chest/stomach area—this turns into a form that resembles oneself and cannot bear.
When necessary, it is for the midwife who must be wise and subtle in all these matters, to watch out against errors and deceit.
When you display all of their figure herein and within them for the purpose that it may be understood by us as represented above in water (i.dict).
When the finger is in contact with its own head naturally, and it exerts force on the female body part firmly, at times causing her vitality to be weakened; then use that servant who holds their hands, as well as those holding them on legs and chest, which contain her essence.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return the metal instrument between yourselves below their seat and in that place hold its tongue so it absorbs moisture from there which is related to humor within them. When pressing the abdomen of the woman within so that the fetus descends.
If not already done, then have the woman been crystallized with honey and pearl powder; these are ground together in a mortar (grinding tool).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "E aprop comanda a lu, aprop le cristeri, que sia compremuda e fay aquella stornudar am condisi; e te la boca de lu e·l nas de lu per huna hora, quar le fet sira foro-getat tantost.
If the feet' extraneous parts are exposed at mealtime, then make sure to reduce those gently and little by little. If the patient does not obey internally (the treatment or advice given), then lift up the woman' extramurally using their hands, placing a cushion under them, and position her body carefully on earth; ensure that the body remains upright despite contraction.
If the masses are not turned out and remain in the flesh or on their chest with it wrapped around them (presumably referring to some form of bandaging), then turn those masses outside and remove what is inside it equally. This indicates that a procedure should be performed where any retained substances within the wrappings must be carefully extracted, ensdictional for balance restoration in treatment as per medieval medical practice:
When the child is lying on their feet, and you push them down into those positions (likely referring to therape extricate or positional therapy for joint pain), then turn over that baby small, cover it with its tongue, and squeeze one foot of yours while extending these little ones.
When he is inside the thighs, then you command him to express himself, and make that protrusion proper again, provided God wills it so.
If there is not enough water that we have recommended, then you return the little body gradually within as long as breaks are taken of that second figure of nature'sin which this lack causes inflammation and pus formation (an abscess). Here is a line-by-line translation into English:
If it is prohibited that some of the fluid we have treated must remain in her body, then take them out completely with muscle and rubber dissolved substances, beat all into a mortar for good percussion, apply lines to the water retained by the woman, purge from the abdomen. Return that part of it into water immersion in order to achieve choleretic effects (which means stimulating bile production).
When parts of it are softened and reduced under moisture from mint and pressure is applied to that part for them: When you submerge under the cold fumigation for an hour, then apply it on a pillow and press that particular swelling externally with your hand, taking away from there afterward, and place pressure below in the lower part of their abdomen using a tight compression, which makes them feel better afterwards.
Eye examination is typically performed by one of them (referring possibly to a doctor or medical practitioner). Here's the translation line by line, maintaining an interpretation consistent with medieval Latin- They shall engage in reducing the pressure of it (possibly referring to a patient's condition), even if you cannot reduce her yourself; raise the woman and take that away. Here is how I interpreted this line, considering medieval medical practice: The phrase implies directing or lifting ('elevate') possibly an appendix or other swolthy organ within the body for its removal ("take it away"). This procedure seems to
If removal is not possible at this time, then guide the instrument along its course (likely referring to performing an enema or similar procedure for therapeutic purposes), forcefully press down on her hips together with concurrent pressure ('concursio'), and administer amber bonds as recommended. This line suggests a treatment approach that involves using manual techniques, possibly combined with medicinal substances like mucilage (a gelatinous material extracted from plants) to address the condition being described—possibly related to constipation or similar issues where an enema is indicated for relief and internal cleaning of obst
If an infection has occurred (implying some sort of bacterial or viral involvement), then apply that poultice over the cloth, and study how to reduce pressure within it, and cover her second natural figure again—instigating urination so she can expel what is inside. Here's a line-by-line translation with interpretation: The text describes applying an antiseptic (possibly made from local plants or other available resources) poultice over cloth to both externally treat the infection site and alleviate internal pressure, likely by helping relieve bladder distention. This implies not only dealing with external symptoms but also addressing potential causes like urinary retention due to an underlying condition such as a severe cystitis or urethral
Evaluation of the belly expanded its size and position itself two fingers away from the mother's navel. When the matron holds her hand over the belly and gently turns that little thing bit by bit, it becomes easier.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Exitus fetus prepared over the side:
When the uterus becomes horrendous according to this malady, and you notice it inside your second twin (presumably referring to a secondary pregnancy or an abnormal growth within), then inspect the second one with your finger in your thumb so that excess moisture is expelled.
If the fetus is suspended on its face and chest, then you must pierce that part of the umbilicus to ensure it does not remain stuck or stagnate.
Here is the translation line by line:
Exit of twins or fœtuses. You know that bones are moved with care, and sometimes they may shift three or four times without cause, which is strange and due to the spirit'dicted by nature itself, not from life within us but externally influenced factors.
Where those are multifacdict and secondary, divided by silk threads into separate compartments for each of them; some courses will be taken at the abdominal opening to perform natural leech therapy daily, while others must also serve as post-application care with us having recommended several sessions.
If the childbirth is difficult and we come upon what has been spoken of by us regarding non-natural figures, then take care of these difficulties as we have reported them to you.
If the midwife is subtle and applies warmth that makes things easier and more delicate, as well as slows down time, then her skill according to everything she has prepared leads us towards healing.
Remembrance of what formed within the womb and was aborted (or miscarried).
Some are formed in the month one and two, three to four, five through nine, even ten times over, which I must verify if a woman has had an abortion once or ten times, causing pain measured by the learned ones' great wisdom.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And at all times when it is in this branch of knowledge that they are strong enough for such matters, then turn their attention towards water (or healing properties), and thus direct themselves therein as well where needed.

When you care for the dead child and there is fluid as we have described in medical division, but it has not yet drained away, and you are about to use a poultice on her body; consider whether she was healthy before accidents that led to loss of life.
When the woman is lying on her back with her head down and thighs raised, it means that she has positioned herself in this way for a certain purpose (likely related to medical treatment). Here's the line-bydependent English translation:
The minister takes that of their hands or bound in the lying position, so that the patient's flesh does not extend beyond and necessitate removal from the womb (birth).
Return yourself moisture to the mother's mouth, using honey and almond milk and sesame seeds of hers;
Here the midwife takes her hand in those oils and mucilage, places it with ease into the womb where the umbilical cord remains, indicating that this is part of a procedure to care for or adjust something within the uterus related to the newborn. (Translation)

When covering in the other part of the body (presumably referring back to the feet or possibly another area mentioned earlier) and both legs, it is necessary/recommended:
If the head of the fetus is large, or contractions occur in the belly and adjusted water (a treatment for excessive fluid), then cover that which intrudes between the cervical spines and hole at the top with something called "alundat", whose form will come from the forms of other instruments used here.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate line by line into English:
If the head is sick and compressed by the sternum (the breastbone), then it has been opened within wherein the moisture that is in the chest has become exuded.
May it not become complicated and do not fear treatment; therefore proceed with the head as soon as you can manage to.
If there is an outpouring from the stomach or if it flows downwardly within you, then break through that which contains the moisture inside of you.
If it is on your feet, then the attraction of yours (referring to yourself) will be light and directed towards the mouth of the woman;
May it be that if the belly and chest are compressed by you, then remove from your hand the cloth which covers them so tightly, break open the stomach and chest until water flows out in those places.
May if other limbs are elevated and the head is turned to the right; may if the patient'thy mouth has been thrown open, then insert into its throat region, and secure that there will be contact with their head, and position a spoon or two in it. Then draw back this instrument towards them while aiming for entry of those fingers inside through the opening they created earlier, thereby inserting one or possibly even several spoons/uncis.
If the mouth of the mother is constricted by caramation (castor oil), which tightens her, do not allow it to stay on her; before that administer treatment for causes related to fatty and moist secretions. E apply plasters; and follow the patient in waters that soothe and moisturize.
If it is on his chest, and if possible, then a sharp instrument should be used: such as the one mentioned earlier for administration to the living person.
If it is not possible, then be inserted into leeches and extracted.
When no cause from secondary illness is discovered.

And you have applied for healing and treated him/her for a long time, but the child is not yet cured.
Now you press on him for some reasons using heavy lances or thrusting tools into the bone, and push his shoulder joint each day, another shoulder every other day; it's too astonishing when there is an excess in the belly area where none of these bodies are located.
And so you consider they are bones of a dead child.
So you dress the patient and extract their bones from there, which are present in the hollows of her thighs; this has been done for a long time to correct them (a small bracelet).

Form of turning in which it is necessary for the maid (the bride):
This is how one undergoes the procedure in which their free will are bound by two pledges on each pair of feet'se ends.

Totally these instruments are exercised, and when their quantities become multiplied as part of the concoction preparation, place them on your table and add servants according to quantity needed.
And do not perform any actions with those instruments, for their necessity cannot be excused.
From removal of the second one (this could refer either to a procedure or an object being removed). In this context where
When the second one (possibly an organ or structure) is retained within the child, you must command the caretaker that holds it back, and apply pressure to relieve any discomfort they may feel; hold your hand firmly over their mouth and nose as a result. If this action results in relief, good job has been done.
If not, then take a rolling stone and pierce through the covering; pause where that burning herb's mouth is (the point of emission), with calamint leaves and rue berries and chamomile flowers and cinnamon bark, all in heated state. All these herbs or some of them are submerged in water within the wave, and they rest upon the flame.
Return your breath (or air) through the mouth of the patient into its cavity using a barrel-shaped cannula, holding it inside where the vomit has accumulated in the uterus.
Return that joint has been swolthy as before and its movement is slowed down quickly again.
May if this treatment is not to be avoided, then command the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or millet meal paste, and insert it into the uterus with force so that your second assistant holds onto what has been found therein; once discovered by the second assistant, remove it piece by piece until removed completely. From above that which is permitted at both sides of the body surface for ease of movement.
If the mother'thy mouth is constricted, we have already recommended treatment with a tightening instrument and medical care from water, medicine made of oil or herbs.
If not all causes recommended have been addressed, then watch that you do not further aggrathy the condition which has already progressed through iterations of abstraction; and if what is inside (presumably a foreign object or worm) comes out of its mouth into the woman's hip socket, clean it with ointment and four medicines. That will purify those days when discharge occurs and relieve expulsion-related issues.

And draw out that tongue which has been ingested from beneath the foggy excretion and repeat as needed.
Of caring for an unharmed child'dicts this line from a medieval medical treatise written in languages somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish and
Of caring for a child does not involve piercing their bottoms, as these delicate and quick ones already have an internal mechanism (possibly referring to the urinary system). In English: The care of children doesn't require us to puncture or injure their lower parts; they naturally possess efficient systems within them. Now she covers the wound that her maid has made there with this lancet; and if not, then makes an incision through the aspirin (aspic), being careful that it does not touch the sore spot.
Return your hand over that wax and oil-soaked material, and take care of the one immersed within it.

This translates line by line into English as follows:
When that old connection is concerned with moisture-laden white or subtle pus, and some measures are taken from these abscesses.
Those penetrating things make them afraid of those that come out and through exhalation or breathing movements; some even suffer from these discharges using the evacuation tool, others due to these substances themselves.
From those passages of fistulas that have flowed into the cavity, and entered the body'dictum (bladder), and from those passages that have infiltrated at the juncture of the hernia and its navel; here is where they come.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When it is in contact with a penetrating fistula that does not enter, you place your bowel therein (inside), and introduce subtle eram or iron into the fistula when no tendernthy discharge.
If in that tightness you feel the attempt undernethy or furry horse within wherein you sense the pressure,
If you do not feel that one of them at all and proceed with none from digestion or vermes (worms) nor windiness, then as we have said before, it does not penetrate, and thus your care is needed here.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or the hernia, it signifies that their task is to extract the urine from there and prevent its escape so that this location can be considered for medicine'dictation.
May it enter the joint of the thigh or into the bone and cause pain in circulation, then he/she shall suffer from this attempt if entry does not occur through ease within the body; immediate treatment is required thereafter; none will suffice herein with regards to medical care nor consolidation by wax.

If that person has cholera entering their colon (entering) the intestine/colon, immediately place your finger in it there to stop them from experiencing further discomfort or complications.
If you feel a thrust in the belly and perceive it yourself through self-examination by metes (doctors/physicians), then be certain that there is penetration; therefore do not attempt to touch or work on that place, for it may well indicate an unsound condition. Here's what each line translates into English:
May even those who are sick in cold beds heal themselves.
From the medicine by which you hope to heal, as previously directed, and into which you place that flame carefully according to the extent of the ulcer, until it reaches around the bowels; then insert therein one or three threads (or more), depending on when you know all these hardened carcasses resembling a feather quill have been softened.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the attempt enters and does not penetrate into where it is in the belly, between that which you hope for flesh or bone, then dry out the area of the wound on the navel, and when doing so, do so at the site of the fistula; thus allowing moisture to reach there through the attempt. And as a result, it is freed from within by this contact.
Now purify those stones clogged together by the penis cannula and without causing any damage from these causes.
May the flux of bile sometimes come between you and your body cavity when that occurs within those organs; then with instruments meant for pus or acute medicine is cauterization performed at this focus, thus alleviating discomgy in these adjusted organs, and abscesses resulting from excess humidities.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
So much healing and execution in these remedies, when they have been restored, the patient is cured and does not fear further cycles of treatment.
May it be that the fistula has entered into the belly of this person and is lengthened on the surface of their body; then insert your finger herein at its entrance, which you will examine further within (the abdomen).
And if one hundred times the temptation and between you and it is flesh or meat, then here there shall not be an operation in him but rather a second way of trust and hope.
La cause here is to administer in it one of three methods: or that which cauterizes said hernia as we have described; or after the cavity has been achieved for further insertion and treatment, so you can intervene with hooks/instrus (handles) provided there are no intestines contained within to prevent accidental injury during lithotripsy of bladder stones according to our description. Or extend that linen or other sharp instrument used initially for cauterization and apply it again over the hernia, this time aiming directly at the protruded contents inside with caution; additionally ensure your own safety by performing these actions from above where possible so as not to descend into an already open wound. Moreover if urine leaks out (from a ruptured bladder), intervene promptly and apply pressure there, then close the opening in that way only when necessary due to potential damage or injury caused during lithotripsy procedures carried out by others with sharp instruments below you; this is for your own protection. And when some interventions according to this method are performed: it is when you insert the catheter into the fistula, and reach inside the cavity of the buttocks up to the navel area and at the perimeter of the buttocks, inserting a catheter needle as follows:
And insert into that cloth wrapping of his fields or around those, and attempt to insert one's hand within the foreskin encircling where it continues afterward (the continuation).
If it penetrates into the margin of the anus pre-cut (or prolapsed), then extract the fallen hair from that defect you have inserted within your private parts; remove its end and adjust both ends, doing each one at a time over several days or two, until perhaps when you insert the hair again into the flesh where those body parts are between the anal extremities of the hair.
Return care for what is inside that has been solidified and healed.
May it not be that the orifice of the fistula is penetrant? Then you must make an incision, as prepared by you in any way possible, but only if necessary within the protrusion itself; and do so with caution therein whereby no part remains inside.
The shape of the spine is what forms the fistula: its curve is sharp and the other division is not sharp, therefore it's unnecessary for them to come together often.
Of the stitches in those where blood flows within that part of it.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: "Emorroydas are second in kind, whether between the belly suggesting it is of grain-like substance or these contain what'thy body turns into fat. From those small and large, which are the sources of that limb'dictum today and its motion and outflow from below the bellybutton, in the extremities of it.
Even if there are openings in the buttocks due to a lack of slight moisture, where clear water flows or a small piece of sanctum blood continues constantly and according to the body's color, it is as follows:
E the cure of that which she has inserted into her colon is to command the malady (disease) to settle and appear within where it inserts, so you may know what treatment it requires. Now you bite and press down with your teeth on the parts that are clamped by your nails, and then strike those areas where their pulses can be felt.
May if the knives are not in those places due to humidity there and softening of them, then take those ashes or sharp stones or woolen cloths, place them where they belong, grind some ash flakes for that purpose upon them, so that they become ready at their designated spots; apply the cautery accordingly following its established procedure. Return those afflicted by other cures back into health while they are being healed.
If the belly does not hold back excretion, then crush it with pestles in which small biting is applied and wash it with the water that's already present in its colon where digestion occurs when the intestine protrudes due to obstruction.
If the hemorrhoids are deficient at the anus, their cause is coldness, and it'thy to grasp those with thy finger or thumbnail, insert them therein, and apply proper care so that they heal as stated within.
And for those who bite the wound, as per this treatment method: take hold of the thread firmly and insert it into the needle; push out the swellings on top to where they meet each other with that tool, then thrust the point deep down at the spot occupied by another part above, wrapping around what remains outside of the thread after passing several times close to or alongside the needle tip. Once in place along its length and stretched tightly (latitudinally), first mend the ruptured area with this suture material; then secure the remaining tail end of the thread further without using additional force on that spot, securing it effectively for wound healing.
When it is necessary for all of them (presumably referring to bodily humors), and not that one specifically removes the excess from there, allowing it through her/himself as needed by nature'thy course.
And place one over the belly, dipped in oil or cloth; and that above covers the colon, commanding the humors to return. Return that which is inside the box when it becomes necessary, and take care of those within with linen or some other form of treatment contained therein until they are healed.
When they are ancient and ineffective according to that medicine (likely referring to outdated medical practices), then you must make an incision on the surface of the spine or insert your own unguent within where there are wet lesions, which prevents them from consolidating; and with proper care for those solidified. This complex sentence suggests a traditional approach in treating certain skin conditions—possibly abscesses (the pus is draining outward)—by surgical intervention or by using medicinal ointments within the lesions to prevent their healing process, following which diligent attention should be paid for proper recovery of these solidified areas. Here we see an adherence to a method where immediate care and containment are emphasized before addressing further treatment strategies (such as consolidation).
When you hold those aggressive rubs that entered while the first urge and they are scalded, then take care of those inside so that they heal.
Be aware that it is the end (or conclusion), and not to be unnoticed according to the color of the body'thy appearance at the clavicle joints; pain occurs throughout the body, mainly in the limbs below shoulders and hips, as well as digits. Therefore, consider an appropriate attire for all these pains.
And when the fluid that is encapsulated within it has entered its course and settled in the grooves of joints or at their bases, remove such humors from there completely, taking care to do so.

May there be a small or large puncture wound on the surface of the body located in front (ante), and when it is crushed by cold humors, pain spreads throughout the body; this constitutes injury to the body'gyma.
Care for the patient involves taking a catheter made of goat'dictum or screw-shaped needle, and secure it firmly within that which contains inside the loop formed by the parts of the body where inserted this canula; with your hand around said catheter as you rotate it within the tube ensuring its position inside the circuit created in the formularis (body cavity), stopping there to eradicate whatever is causing inflammation.
If you wish, make a channel with an iron or silver tube according to this manner:

May you plaster that which is in the belly and intestine pains with aplomb such that by doing so repeatedly (iterating) the points of cautery within become healed.
If there is bleeding or abscess in the belly (the abdomen), then let the cups be gently and light, as are used by the physicians for their children'thy criteria.
Of treatment for diseases or illnesses.
You have already entered the division of curing diseases that were suitable for free individuals like you, and hereby describe the cure associated with those humors in accordance with their complementarities.
Therefore, it is said that the pains are varied according to where they occur and how they manifest as stones in the flesh.
Here come the reasons why movements are painful due to humors accumulating in cavities during childbirth or because of sitting on hard surfaces like stones and benches, being hit by a lance or staff, using wooden chairs, touching these objects that cause such causes.
May the humors present in the body'thy locations be like vermin on the head, or neck (the col), or chest, belly, backside, and limbs. They resemble those of the extremities to these members.
Even when recommending treatments for various ailments, it allows breaks in thought and rules regarding other illnesses.
When you come to feast on simple illnesses (the flu), the memory of complex diseases will arrive at the third capital'thy table for discussion and treatment.
Thus say when you ache in the head simple and it is not fracture, then consider if it's because of ear stone or appearance; once touched only atopically (topically) on the occipital region just now, don’t delay too long. Extract from that part as much as possible unless there are any reasons against drainage, mainly when such head pain is due to intracranial effusion which occurs with apendicitis inflammation presenting itself through ear discharge (otalgia).
When it is time for the contrary procedure on the affected area, and you must keep watch over the male (patient'thy) womb to prevent fullness of seed and meat:
May it be that from your careful examination there is found not one cause of suffering, then you should decrease the intake of food and avoid meat or drink entirely.
When pressure is applied over the bed (bedridden patient), if you numb it with caustic substance like rosemary oil or vinegar in which they are immersed, do this carefully.
If you are secure in applying the caustic, pause over the ground (the area where treatment is being applied), if it has recently been cleaned and the dust that was recommended for use on small points hasn't changed since then.
If the air has changed and become cold, then pause over it with a healing ointment while inside is being restored to health.
If the child is large or for lack of space and resemblance, and their lips are not properly adjusted to suckle (breastfeed), then they should be put on a suitable device according to what has been recommended by the method used in breast tying.
May it be discovered that the child has cracked bones and skin but is not restrained by them; rather, only a small carrier is used for this part, where you will attend to the injury with medicines and restore flesh back in place of their navel area, commanding the humors (fluids) formed from foods such as cabbage heads and forms similar to these, within which they must be composed.
If decay occurs in the bone and does not stick to the skull, then you will remove all this putrefied substance with water and pour some water as well; take care of it carefully.
May if in these diseases an artery or vein through which blood flows is not detached by medicine, then ask about the artery (not treated), and cut that one with a sponge or ligature (ties it off); and if you need to provoke what we have said does not cause discomfort, do so while ensuring that the vessel has been severed.
If these pains are simple and small, then their cause is chilliness; take powder on those places until the air changes them.
The mania of the polish: this is a recipe for oil made by crushing one part each of sesame seeds and dragon'dicti (dragonwood), three parts not yet extinguished; all mixed together, ground finely, with that mixture as the broth, to be concocted well within where it adheres, and coagulated using lime.

When any one applies solely cautery without being currently in their senses and sanction of dragon blood,
And now this operation takes place on the major humors when they are stopped over those and have not been disturbed recently by their seat of nature (the liver), which until today has remained unchanged.
If the air has been altered, and especially in summer time, you may not understand its position here, but then take care of those thicker ointments we have mentioned before; or apply thick flour paste from the finest mill ground with water and honey inside it to make poultices. And pay careful attention to these remedies until they heal your condition.
May you treat a broken bone in the body and it is small, then extract water from its movement.
In English line by line translation of the provided medieval medical treatise text and the additional Latin phrase, we get:
From the humors of the colon
Might as well if you have acid in your chest, there is not a difference in medicine, and between the child'thy head when it’s simple.
May you inscribe or know the nerve of the colon and if it is indeed a nerve, not in its place but that which should be avoided for treatment with this fluid causing strong constriction, provided carefully as when washing hands to avoid wound healing, holding their fingers. No pressure is placed on any cause of total madness; for the substance of nerves and its continuous flow to the brain—this matter they place in all members themselves.
If the patient requires medicinal waters for treatment, apply some as poured water and either scented or unscented oil on it; after washing with these waters along with other stones, heat them according to this methodology, and cover their sweat (perspiration).
If the child is large, administer stitches or clamp their lips together, and take care that these are done until they heal.
May it be that if there is depth or pain in the lower parts of the body mass, then through such an opening pierce into the location where gout has developed.
May it be that in the patient there is an inserted artery and a flow of blood has been obtained from it; if so, separate or dry out this one, or perform cautery on it as necessary to cause effusion (bleeding).
May you have already inserted the vertebrae of the spine or all, and saved the veins in the neck, then adjust your lips with a suture on the spinal column without touching it; therefrom align that back to its natural shape, strengthen that part for erect posture, leave it covered over several days until healing occurs.
May if the child already has pain in their bones, you will strike that place, and where there are fragments of bone within them; but if it is not apparent to you what needs attention, allow whatever comes out from inside so the body can purify itself, and be separated and extracted accordingly.
If it is a recently cleaned surface, then gently sprinkle this dust upon that which has been recommended for you. If in the patient there is an abscess (or possibly means "fistula"), then heal that which comes back from where it returns to his head, at his skull/head'thy place.
If it is a percussion of lance or cudgel, and at times the depth, then also considers may if from the pestilence comes winds when the womb inflames; understand that the pestilence kills.
If there is not depth and the filth has recently come out of its sanctuary, then you pause in it during the first hour after pollution begins, without stretching to prevent the sank from remaining deep within and returning to the heart, possibly pausing with linen attracted by enguent (ointment), applying pressure on those veiled areas throughout the day.
If the ointment is not at your disposal, then rest in the warmth of the earth worm'thy dwelling place to let incoming water from humidities flow; and make sure that swelling (ma lauta) lies on the ground so as for its fluidity within may be regulated.
May if already three days have passed without spasm or convulsion of the evil spirit in the belly, and at times other good dispositions are found within you; then take care of that which is needed for healing herein, as long as it remains sick. (Translation: May there be a period where no abdominal cramps from an ill-spirit nor tremors have occurred over three days or more. Whenever this happens and other beneficial aspects are discovered within you, tend to what is required for healing herein until recovery.)
May it be that the healing of him/her is possible, and even if so for a time, you know that there is an abscess formed; therefore attend to this matter with your own eyes (capital).
If the child is a result of an incision or cut and it's simple on the surface of the skin or buttocks, then treat that area with water used for stitching if large, or powder if small.
If there is pain before the mouth and sharp teeth inside it, now you have already detected them, and if they are separated from each other, extract those teeth with forceps (towers). If they are not separated, let them enter inside that the vermin may be expelled from them.
From the other accidents in the other members, restoration is achieved through what we have brought here today.
From abdominal discharges (or flatulence). The text is dealing with medical symptoms in
The indigestion that causes pain in the stomach can be great (gran), small (pauca), or severe and moving discomfort (migra). Here is a translation of your sentence into English: "The type of indigestion causing abdominal
A minor disruption is felt as difficult due to other manipulations; the removal of their interference therein becomes challenging unless you take measures against them immediately afterwards, so that your body and stomach become tightened (stressed), making it hard for any remaining disturbance within yourself. Here's an English translation: "A minor disruption is felt as difficult due to other treatments; the removal of their influence therein becomes challenging unless measures are taken against them immediately afterwards, so that your body and stomach become tightened (stressed), making it hard for any remaining internal disturbance.
Therefore the best solution is to move it there, as in these areas of which we have spoken about its difficult reduction.
Even knowing that the belly'suplacement is done with four kinds of stitches, if you want to sew wounds they are common and suitable for other diseases on the body as well.
When two other stitches communicate with each other or themselves in the area of the abdomen' extruded wound, it may be either mutually between them or within their own seam.
When you recommend each one of your explanations and declarations.
So when the patient is small and suffers from some cause of the intestine (budel), it becomes difficult to reduce that, often due to one of two reasons: either because of diminutive size since disruption occurred while we were here with you today, or if the intestine inflates due to cold air.
And when the fluid enters (the body), then quickly cut that which you have submerged in water alone or squirming within it, and cloves, pepper, and pumice into those things wherein inflammation is resolved inside.
And when joint pain has occurred in which dipping or immersion was involved, it is better than water alone for the resolution of inflammation.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine in the water where it was elevated and with lavender and mint, thus allowing for its gentle return to the body due to a minor cause.
If there is relief from the patient' extrusion at this time of treatment, then divide (the rupture) into a small piece with an instrument for which you have previously inscribed incisions.
The initial text line translates as follows into English word by word/phrase:
From the tool, its form follows:
One sharp turn of the limb (joints), and another non-sharp one; subtlety is not present in bone (spine), where it becomes blunt or dull at some point.
And when the swelling increases and the intestine protrudes out of its cavity, it is necessary to reduce it back into its natural shape for the patient if possible in this place, which would be better.
When the disruption is wide and it's in the lower abdomen, where you have pushed out the hernia into their thighs, and placed cushions on top of them; if it's below the belly area, then push back the head onto Luca and place pillows under his chest and pelvis.
If the disruption is in one of the parts of the belly, then immediately pause your understanding and consideration for so that what lies within can be pushed out by itself.
When it is necessary that you attend (care for) large and traveling pains,
In minor plagues (small pains), pause what you have prepared for yourself as the mediator between your most painful parts, where disruption is whole in its ma and adjusts the lips of yours accordingly; also prepare to remove any stitch that might cause further issues from here to there.

Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "They are small needles moving within hardness and subtlety; those that move in fineness pierce the flesh, while larger ones enter with difficulty into the cleft of the spine, hence why they migrate between softness and coarseness.
And where the needle is placed in either of the patient'dict lower extremities as directed, to ensure that the flesh does not protrude and that dirt cannot accumulate near its foundation.
And they are not sewn for that the patient should be prevented from healing (consolidation).
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English line by line:
These surgical needles are filled with thread in a suitable manner and placed on those small wounds; it suffices for their stitching either one or two of these, as needed.
May the second stitch be common: and it is that you gently perform the sewing of the four limbs' ends, from the collarbone to both arms with a needle in which thread (felt) is wrapped around very finely and thickly.
When the needle has penetrated these four extremities, reduce the sharp instrument of that piece cut by her surgeon so that the wound cavity below can ascend to dry land, ensuring that sutures are strong as cloth where dressings will be tightly fastened.
When there is a pause in any of the stitches made for this body part (likely referring to an area that has been previously mentioned, possibly surgical or wound care), it concerns the thickness of said
When speaking about a suture in relation to "homes," which seems out of context given medical terminology typically refers
In this context, it appears the original text is attempting to describe a situation involving suturing (stitching), possibly in an emergency or post-surgical setting within what seems like medieval medical practice:
The child is solidified in the spaces of fifteen days or thereabouts, and treated for it so that they heal; after five months, care will continue according to their disposition.
E the other physicians had not healed it; and by a miracle of fire, they could no longer cure that wax in the place where it was neither being scraped off nor treated with any medicine, perhaps after rubbing over it twice a day and bathing regularly in honey water within which the wax has been melted.
May you direct two kinds of sewing according to what is narrated by Parole (Word).
When you begin stitching of the neck and insert needle from the divided forehead to the divided chin,
So when the needle enters into the navel and in that limb's contours as straightened out and lengthened throughout all of it, place your finger where you have inserted the needle; then let the needle penetrate into the other extremity of what was previously entered.
When you have caused that penetration there, then cause another penetration in the same extreme of that body-part from where it originated to where it ended; and let the exteriority (of the wound) be here present, and make a puncture in its other extremity within this part.
When it is necessary for that thing to enter the cavity you have provided, allowing everything in there to pass through completely into the tail of your body where it currently resides within its division or chamber (the area inside), having already made entry with what has been introduced at this place.
Here begins the treatment from this patient's side, and takes that away at the extremity which is on the other side of here, and pushes it into that same area in that chest section where there was an opening previously; also extracting what remains inside from under his/her jaw.
Here comes the sentence to translate: And give another remedy and apply it within what you have cooked, according to that which is needed hereby as an example.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And the sum total of this suturing technique is that you sew with thread on which hairs are attached, so as to stitch up a wound at the extremity part of the limb (presumably fingers or toes), and let that other bandage stay until it has been completed.
May the second type of stitching that Gualia dedicates herself to is what she speaks and recommends here for you; it' extrinsic part cut by another healer who also makes this, adding all parts according to nature into your body division – they apply one extremity from themselves and match their own other extremities on the corresponding ones of yours. Do so as per Gualia’s recommendation.
When you keep the needle at your appointed place on the departing part, and make that go into the departure portion there in it, turning over two fingers of the chest; and rotate the needle so that its penetration reaches from one finger to another within the wound.
Here is the line by line translation into English:
This stitching is better than ordinary sewing and it serves as a memory for the wound to be healed with.
This is the speech of Guaya
May the needle be sharpened with two pins so that you insert it into these places where there are nails, and start inserting this sharp pin inward through one of them while cutting along the other ones which grip your chest tightly.
Even knowing that a disturbance occurs in the intestine'thy place within the abdomen, remember that stitching it there is more difficult than at other parts of the belly.
May the application of medicine for common diseases be judged by other diseases.
When this causes it happens when the recent rain has affected their sanctus dens currently and you return the intestine and apply that treatment thereon until a restorative layer of skin appears on top of that, pause over such place where moisture touches.
If the air has altered the humidity, then take position over that area where you are applying hard and tight bandages on the fields (body parts), ensuring they become firmly fixed; also pay attention to this condition as it is part of treating other diseases within which one is currently present.
May you not have the medicines present at this moment; instead, place them there for now while something begins to absorb pus and cough phlegm within a day or two, as long as you are taught by me, until it is healed, so that you will not need other medical remedies when these plagues become simple.
If you fear that the vermin may communicate in injury to the primary members of the body, then submerge wool in warm or rotten oil and place it where between joint angles and legs there are areas; pause this within the circuit of these locations.
If there is pain or putrefaction in your intestines, they wander aimlessly within you; and if the distention has reached the cavity of it and causes a protrusion that exits through its opening, then:
Being aware that what is from the thick intestine heals quickly, whereas what is in the thin intestines takes longer to recover.
It is difficult for the intestine that has been called "gout" to be cured by folk remedies contained within it; this difficulty arises from several factors: (1) the large number of veins present in it, and (2) its size at those places which affects them as well. Additionally, due to their subtlety—the nature of these intestines is delicate like nerves—and because they are closely associated with that part of the body'supra mentioned earlier', curing becomes challenging for folk remedies alone.
If the material you proceed from is leather (the hide), then obtain that freshly made and cut it according to your plan in which you reduce swellings by compressing with a linen cloth, as mentioned earlier for returning intestines or hernias into their cavity.
May it be that space has been reached and black or dark matter has entered therein; when this happens, press down firmly on the area where darkness is present, in order to expel phlegm from veins and arteries.

Remembrance of illness when inflammation occurs in the intestine (budel).
When you have a disruption in the intestine and it is small enough to be restored with cupping at home, then come here quickly for that which was present as pus in the seventh part of the stomach (appendix), an old infected abscess or fistula, along with signs and symptoms of its management and movement.

And if there is need for pause on the first part of it (the initial shape), and not cease doing so until another portion has been formed according to the quantity remaining in all the patient' extraneous substances/humors, which are referred to here as "plaga.
Reduce those things within the belly, and break up these accumulated masses inside the bowel so that it is healed; without causing harm to any malady in anyone'thy condition.
And it is possible that the intestine (belly) has been pierced by something delicate from within the body using a needle; therefore you must hold onto this extremity of the intestine and wrap it with thread, placing another piece of thread in between to bind around the intestine therein. This will reduce disruption as well as prevent further damage or rupture (rupture).
This operation of sewing is not our only way, but rather a pathway based on trust and hope.
May it be if the child is large and wide, primarily in one of the small intestines, then it will not heal naturally hereby itself, and cannot cure by all means at once.
Of treating hemorrhoids and fistulas.
1. Know that all young and scabby when they become old, and it gets ulcerous; nor is it consolidated or bandaged for any length of time without falling apart anywhere in the body—universally speaking, we call this an abscess (or fistula).
E fistula according to truth is a tightly woven, hard, white fabric where there is no pain and which swells similarly when the patient experiences penetrating pain; therefore it comes forth that thick discharge (pain).
In moistened clothing it gets dampness, and if not removed quickly enough within a few hours, the wetness dissipates. Some moisture is moved here, and it's scant, thick, and subtle.
And have shown all those causes and their symptoms are under the care of medicine in its division.
Once you understand this knowledge of treatment for an abscess that occurs through operation,
E understand that fistulas are present in all body members, and those among them:
Therefore, this one among these ulcers is from the diseases that are hard to cure and do not receive care; it takes up labor and ignorance.
If there is any depth in the wound that does not reach these locations mentioned herein and you hope for its healing, and wish to know about it again, take up arrows or iron tools; if the fistula after being straightened out, when questioned, responds with "here I am," then:
If the fistula is twisted, investigate that subtle lead under its own weight and lift it upwards; this heavy metal will straighten out due to its gravity when dealing with curvature.
If there is an obstruction of blood with frightful consequences within you, it will not be possible for you to attempt on yourself.
Now apply the poultice to him with his own ointments; moisture through which you cleanse that area will be absorbed by other salves and washes from their possessions.
E precisely ascertain it is possible that you understand the nerves within yourself if herein lies your cavity's condition or a distant one; this represents either an open long fistula, which rests above all in strength of body and mindfulness about intestines (belly), where guts reside and suffer from pain for reasons accidental to adhesion. Here comes the translation line by line:
When you have stood over all these causes and see them clearly, then go to the treatment according to your confidence: for you consider whether it is an apparent fistula or in a place of joint union, nerve, artery, vein, or one of those places that are connected with yours.

If the fistula is deep and secondarily dilated, then cover it with what you can find within reach until your intervention; clean that thoroughly from all of its corrupted parts, and apply poultices wrapped in sharp medicines around them, inserting those into the cavity of the fistula which you have comprehended as iron.
When some cold humor enters the cavity of the abscess, and medicine acts quickly to remove it therefrom,
And restore that which remains in wax, as it generates healthy flesh within while being healed.
If it is not healed by this means (the poultice), then apply a second one as recommended.
May it be that the cause of fistula is bone or sinew which you must certify, then inquire about that and dry it as recommended, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve, or major limb issue mentioned here.
Might your bone be discovered and there is some corruption or blackness within, then take care of that which contains the corruption completely until it heals entirely; attend to this liquid inside so as for those who have been ensnared by their illness may recover fully.
If you are not healthy and poor in blood as before the habit, then you will understand that you have not reached the complete cure of corruption; accordingly, touch upon it gently and meticulously restore its humors at the most recent state, and leave what is necessary for restoration.
And if you are healed, eat; but if not, understand that the corruption is deep within the body cavity, which has not been achieved yet, and therefore it'thy time to lay this out now.
If the bones are decayed or small (deformed), then it is within your power to extract them with fine forceps as required.
If there is a stone in the bones, then very carefully extract all of them without leaving any cause to weaken your strength.
If any contrary cause of the fluids occurs and there is neither fear nor mistake in their insight, then you must inspect those ligaments or bones here present, and divide them into pieces (break apart the bones).
If you are not prepared with stones for your bones of the hour, then place there whatsothy put down on the ground that pushes upward those same bones made of flesh and sinew; let it be kept where it is not consolidated (hardened), but constructed as much as possible in line with which you have inscribed during your operation.

May it be that there is a great bone obstruction in your knee or thighs and looks like those joints; once you've damaged yourself herein (on the face), just for now let this foreign body stay within, so little remains of its harm and ruining. And afterward restore health to one’se self.
If from there the decay is great and has already reached the bone marrow of the bone, then it becomes necessary to close that place where the rot was acquired, and for healing such tissue must be ensured within its location as far as this corruption arrived.
E you recommend that he go down into his hollow in the thigh so as to ease and assist with your operation.
Once a young man for over xxx years is suffering from pain in his knee, and the mucus material that enters into motion within the joint itself constitutes putrid matter with great abscess formation inside it, without external cause being present here.
And when the time has extended due to errors made by doctors within which abscesses have formed and their materials are being expelled, its treatment is slowed down while a fistula opening exists in it, where they produce pus with various humidities that everyone takes care of.
And after a long time of treatment by doctors and not in their soups (suggesting traditional home remedies), he was called back to the practice because of his health issues related to blood (art).

If your leg protrudes and you have already applied pressure to it following this method: then take hold of that limb with a strong bandage, command someone else to extend the first thickened bandage over it; place that second bandage on top of the flesh undernethy's bulging leg, stretching outward until the meat is pulled back towards its respective parts. This will allow you to saw through at this location so as not to drag the meat with your tool.
When you elevate or use a table for decency, when it is allowed not to cut the corrupt flesh with the saw that does not harmfully remove anything from the body.
When the saw is used on the damaged spot little by little, and if it's in the cavity of the broken bone where it does not appear at first glance, then use another tool to work with it further.
If the bones are eroded and not prominent, it is one continued division, and decay takes place in either of them or both; then rest with gentle pressure, and hold that piece from which the corruption continues to be a continuation of the sawing process.
And if it is a small incision according to the location of decay as we have mentioned.
If the corruption is in the joint, inspect that corrupted joint and saw away from it what remains of the other part.
If decay is in the continuous flow of joints, it is not due to reason but necessity (or perhaps a lack thereof).
If the corruption is in the maw or chest, it'thy hard; but once thou hast sought out and recognized wherein the corruption appears to thee, and have removed that which can be done by thee accordingly with any arrangement thereof which may possibly belong unto thee, then thy malady shall hereafter be corrected as long as neither venom nor nerve opposes.

Here they are discussing an old method where substances like ground minerals would have been used in bandages as rudimentary forms of surgical treatment, possibly for removing and immobilizing foreign objects within deep or multiple injuries until further medical care could be provided. This indicates a primitive understanding that certain materials might help to both remove debris from wounds (like glass shards) and promote healing by securing them in place with adhesive qualities, at least before modern surgical interventions became the norm.
If necessary, repetition of bloodletting, when possible, changing those.
If blood discharges are prohibited from suspension, then bleed the location immediately or leave an ice pick in the locations where it has frozen; and have them stopped (their flow), when I feel any new throb just now.
When you wish for a poultice over those areas, scatter a little of salt, ash, or sulfur there and apply it immediately.
Assuming that this text is written in a language influenced by Medieval Latin and contains terms common among medieval medical practitioners, here's an attempt at translating the provided sentences into English line by line with some interpretative leew This chapter is essential in the practice of medicine as it pertains to the restoration and management of broken bones and dislocations within the skeletal system.
Oh child, heed this: the learned physicians and barbers here boast of their knowledge in these capitals, which they sometimes neglect to consider for free reading by those who are not from Antiquity or cannot read such letters themselves.
For this reason these diseases of the learned doctors among us are excluded; and I have not neglected them for any time since their beginning in our land; nor have I omitted to apply what is after learning from those ancient books, so that out of it I extract knowledge.
Return adjustment according to experiments and studies throughout one'thy life.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Capital First. (This line appears to be an introductin
Summarize and gather examples from the very essence of bone fractures; for which foundation is essential before we start recalling details about the members broken by these injuries, as well as various others if one among them. (This translation attempts to convey a sense that in order to discuss or understand specific cases of bone fractures and their consequences thoroughly, it's necessary first to have some basic knowledge or premises concerning what constitutes such an injury.) Therefore, in the introduction to this chapter let us summarize the contents of our discussion; and within these chapters we aim for clarity on their craftsms and standards concerning which you or others must be quick enough knowing that they are not your own works but a masterpiece. (Here, the translation suggests an expectation set in academia where authors should clearly present summaries at the beginning of each chapter while explaining any particular terms used therein to ensure comprehension among their readers and students.)
And so it is said that when you experience a bone fracture or dislocation and twisting (sesame), do not tear yourself apart in amputation or realignment of this thing unless there'dict other causes which prohibit, to heal from weakness, or if the injury itself inflicts pain such as severe bruising, crumbled bone fragments, or intense heat and fever.
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English: Provide it with tender meats from sheep and pigs along with fresh herbs and vegetables; prohibit large grains and fill it up completely with food that opens veins in the stomach, ensuring you serve a poultice treatment to prevent bleeding.
Whenever it returns to its original place in time with which custom has always been associated,
And when the bone breaks begins to be repaired, then it is known that the malady's humors are cut with nourishing food rich in bulk and heaviness; similarly, as for those fleshly bodies of wheat flour boiled in water, and rice, and chestnuts, and calf brains, and fresh peas, heavy meats and their like substances to them.
Be aware that the bones crack when they are in people who live within and below their last village, it is impossible for them to continue being continuous and solid according to their natural state due to drying out of their limbs.
Indeed nature adjusts and binds over the broken bones of any part that seems swolthy like gluten in which one is entrapped with their cohorts inside where poison from strength and firmness, akin to an oven's heat during feasting, cannot prohibit our labor.
For this reason it is necessary that we pause the foods of humours (which carry weight and consistency), as have already been mentioned.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Here comes another aspect of bone breakage that has been elaborated in its own section different from the other one.
Much variation in bone breakage is noted herein. Here come the translated lines from the medieval medical treatise:
Every specific form of discomfort is present in the patient's body during their own recovery time, as recalled at different locations within themselves.
Misnamed bone break/fracture of the bone. For the sake of this query and based on understanding from contextual clues across multiple languages including Latin-based ones (Latin itself, Italian, Spanish), here's a rough translation:
And when there is no obvious curvature nor does it break the skin touching the bone and thigh bone not causing great pain without injury herein lies no fracture.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English:
If you encounter an abscess that requires drainage, then leave it for as many days until the abscess stops draining; and afterward apply warmth to each area where possible by raising or massaging (elevating and manipulating).
Be aware that I have applied restoration and bleeding here, which is better than the blood in the bone where you crushed it.
Return that second one which is coming back with memory of him/her (or in Latin "eum").
May it be that if the bone is satagized (deformed or set wrongly), then extension of this broken part, whether from leg or head/hands may need intervention by yourselves; or if the member is small in size, your hand suffices. Or perhaps a cord and your own hand are needed for either large bones or single long tendons (cords).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Even as your guard, do not press on the groin during your operation or injury; and employ yourself according to your strength whenever necessary, serving you in various forms of times.
When you touch it at this time with your hand and if herein ye find any other cause apart from what is intended, correct that which has been done according to the measure of your intention.
Excessive stretching and compression, as feared by doctors who perform operations with their tools, or may cause a contraction in the limb where they have observed fluid accumulation through their work.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And that is the quality of a tranquil member, which I recommend; thus you understand how members are various in their smallness and largeness, as well as in form.
From those who are small in stature like their arms and chest (referring to infants or smaller individuals), it happens that they resemble others coming towards them with cloth so fine undernethy, as if wrapped around themselves gently.
May those who have large thighs or hips be covered so that their layer is soft and durable; where the fatty layer connects with the strongest part of all below the waistline, preventing them from falling inside in such a way.
Here begins the treatment, take your bowel evacuation at a convenient time for it, above where that crack occurred in three or four layers around the affected limb, and tightly bind a small piece of thread to the bandage.
Return the bone to its natural position in the place of breakage and a tight hand that does not alleviate pressure on the location of the breakage. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return your arm in its cavity with a bandage and gradually soften the tightness so that most of it is relieved by pressure from the area itself.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return your hand over this other bandage, and place it properly on these wrappings that have just been applied to keep the infection from spreading further if there is no inflammation or abscess forming at the site; leave it like this for a few days; and hold onto those strips tightly.
Here come the splints of canna'alda race, and formed well by hand; they may be made from wood or reed stalks, their form is as follows for each one according to this shape and size.
However the splint placed over that fracture is thick and a small one was added to the other splints; according to how far it reaches within the body both in size and miniature, place your strong arm on top of these splints as per your initial swelling; position another bandage under their feet (feet), following our description of edema's location relative to its origin. As the fracture is extended from this point, so too will the swelling increase accordingly with it.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: When the threads are thick and thin, and they belong here; if these threads (possibly referring to sinews or tendons) are large, look at them through the operation of sharp needles when threading the corresponding cords, for it is a great error when this constriction comes out of balance.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Exercise subtle movements are not convenient when you cannot secure yourself with those waters which flow between stone and stone without a day'dict.
If the patient'se legs are led through their bones and cause constriction in your location, do not apply pressure immediately; wait until a lead or wool padding comes into place where it should be to prevent injury (lesion).
Some breaks are child'thy in nature and there is a rupture at the spine, which brings about memory recall on that particular occasion of its second occurrence.
E understand that all broken body parts are not torn apart on the first day; this causes them to worsen when you delay treatment beyond seven days or more, according to your judgment of their susceptibility to infection and decay (ulcer).
This is how medieval surgegy practitioners treated injuries caused by bone breaks and dislocations (fractures and luxations), which they call for the intervention of specialists (the term 'emplaustres').
Manipulation of the splint when cold after bone healing is convenient for complex movements and mostly in the legs and belly; it's that where neither warmth nor humidity prevails: using powdered talc, and marrow from flour provides movement to joints.
When that comfort is with you as well, but if discomfort arises from the humoral book (referring to an imbalance in bodily fluids), then do not make it soft or subtle; instead use this treatment accordingly.
Autotherapy for fracture and dislocation, mixture of asafetida, lapidanum, acacia, enula, and migra: composed entirely from mustard seeds gathered by the dragonfly, five parts myrrh, two parts aloe extract taken from either water or albumen if malady'dict is severely damaged; using this remedy will restore broken bones gently to their place and confer health on people.
Other forms of placement that comfort and cause fracture or twisting: mixture of white henbane root, myrrh from the dragon tree, acacia dragon sap, frankincense dragon resin; take these in quantities x; y; z. xx.
All of them are crushed in the mortar and pounded with beaters or ground into a paste made from water or an album (an ancient form of milk protein), and they take it as medicine.
Medical intervention at joints and bones, causing pain in those places due to cracks or fractures: it is tied with a stitched thread and submerged in oil and vinegar; fixed over the place where located.
In this cast there is not been any restoration or healing by poultice and pain has been purged properly.
Other bandage materials that restore the cuts are branches of fig and seed pods of poppy, which together form a dressing.
Manipulation of the plaster applied for bone fracture restoration and when you wish to resolve osteomyelitis: a recipe with almonds, bread crumbs, rosehip flowers, wheat flour from all parts divided into three portions; these are ground together and formed in clumps on the limb that has not been cut.
If it is cut, then comfortingly apply that same water from the colon or sprinkle and use of it herein.
Other manicure of pus in healing that this first one, when you have an abscess deepening must be the restoration: a mixture of aloe and seed from it, honey, musk root, mint, marigold flowers, chamomile blossoms; all chopped up and soaked either in vinegar water or double distilled water according to the quality of the limb and their repose.
May Ypocras does not prescribe any treatment for the limb that has been stretched unless pains are caused by wax and oil, nor other reasons; he recommends moving between coarseness and subtlety.
May Gualia have seen that they are pausings in the broken part of them and their causes for exsiccation due to heat when taken with myrrh, seeds, and substances from those same causes recommended by us hereinabove mentioned.
Mending of the plaster that comforts wound and pain: recipe with crushed beetleworms or deer antlers chitters, ground into powder; they are pulverized forms (powders) and meshcafts (fine particles), these constitute its application.
May the quantity according to which you tear and separate it is that if there is not pain or bleeding nor does the bone break apart from its place, then do not rush your work for days. If you feel a sharp or piercing pain at the location, then bend or dislocate that part in the hour and apply your plaster on it.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If at times the ulcer and rheumatism (joint pain) and inflammation are present along with all other accidents, and indigestion requires enema or strictures, then repeat what you have done for the patient lying down.
If no cause is found in any of those mentioned above for the affected limb, then wait three to seven days or more until you appear on its healing process; some physicians allow this duration up to twenty days after noticing improvement in the limb'thy fracture will harden and flesh (tissue) over it.
When it is necessary in the tightness of your first limit as a whole and when you have remembered (the food from malady), then adjust within that constriction/tightness and insert into its belly'dictum, according to what precedes memory recalling.
If you again find the fracture site cracked and worn away more than covered, know that nourishment is prohibited to prevent healing there; hence gather all such material for this entire duration; immerse a small object in water daily for three days, relieving stiffness from it, allowing nutrition (and thus the patient'thy body) to recuperate.
May those who restore the broken limb delayed beyond meal time (according to their practice), and when restored according to deformity, it is error in their work, great fear, and if rightly done they will expand the Ancients freely without water harm.
And they have not seen any of it from there yet, so it is reasonable that none has done.
Capital Second: When a fracture occurs in the head.
The spices of breaks are motes (points), and their forms are various, with distinct causes: some due to the percussion (striking) of space, which enters into the cranium, causing headaches similar to those experienced in the chest; if a cavity is pierced by this force within any bone segment, entering both flesh and marrow without passing through the skull' extradural portion: here we refer to an absolute displacement.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
This break or foreign object that has already entered the periosteum (the layer surrounding bone), either in the face of the bone itself, and here is where these breaks from inside the bones are; big or small ones.
And when there is a bone break, it is set in the subtlety of the hair'sewn fine thread or pinna (bone pins), hence this particular kind of capillary fracture becomes known as such by name hereafter.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Mostly it is pain in the bones of the joints due to moist accumulations on top of elbfalts (kidneys).
And with all these broken bones fixed as separate plates, they are bound together. When all of it arrives at its place for healing.
With all these tools of breakdown, I examine them to discover the attempts and decayed flesh that is upon them.
A special channel is discovered when it comes to the bone, and kept off from therein, until black fracture appears.
When treating fractures consider the accidents of melancholy, and when such accidents indicate through signs that show pain (as in cholera vomiting, stretching, loss of understanding, withdrawal from company, syncopes, acute fever), and treatment of their humors and requests regarding these things, they do not heal.
If an accident of misaligned body you see, then you begin its healing for it.
The cause is that when the plague comes into contact with you in the common room and at night during the fourteenth day of this entire arrangement, cover your bone studies on the leg' extrinsically as it happens each day.
If it is in the summer days, cover your bones from above with clothing throughout the day seven (Sunday), as water has rotted them through contact and may bring on complications that have been recommended to you.
If the fracture has reached the brain'supreme covering(meninges), and is small pieces and arthritic debris (fragments of bone or cartilage within joints causing inflammation, possibly due to degenerative conditions like osteoarthritis), then it is recommended that you insert these fragments into the affected area.
When you lift the head of the hernia and discover it above the bone on your body according to what is customary in children'thy figure, so that it protrudes from the hernia.
If you have to examine the bone for fracture or purulent osteomyelitis (bone infection), apply cold water and cauterize it immediately, holding your hands over this area where cloths are soaked with wine and oil infused; thus allowing rest for the inflammation caused by abscess, ensuring you're secure from bone sequestrum (dead bone separated due to infection), starting treatment at the site of injury and its debridement.
When it is second of two methods for operation.
E one method is that you insert into the sinew such as this, and herein lies its formulation: And apply another slipper of less thickness than that aforementioned; and so too does it follow in shape.
Returns are allowed for certain incisions that have been made secondarily.
When various instruments of cutting are used by you and others, which have been sharpened to the extent that they are among those with shorter blades than their counterparts, located at the ends of extension, made from iron or steel.
Using their ease in touch upon the joints, so that they do not strike the head and lead them along this way.
If the bones are hard and sharp, then when you administer injections into their circulatory system (which they call "the channels"), do not make them deep as these points are called pillows here.
E for there is no name given but these that pause beneath the bone of the thigh until it reaches the knee joint or where the leg's end meets near to form a round extremity or small circle, which prevents being submerged and passing through the hardness of the bone.
It is convenient that you grasp these many ladders of which each one corresponds to the sharpness required for any part of your skull where there exists an acute extremity, with quantity determined according to the amount of sharpness in this area of the brain.
Here is the translation of this medieval medical treatise line by line into English:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And where you take care with utmost caution that the scissors do not touch any cause of apoplexy (collapse).
And when the bone has passed through its circuit and if it continues to be pierced at this point in time, extract what comes out therein; for that which is extracted will resemble knives or picks used elsewhere inside the body as a result of water within the bone (which can happen with excess fluid accumulation), but note that some may also contain pus and subtle elements like those found in other instruments.
If any part of the bones is small and weak, then take that which makes it easy for you to manage them; accordingly care for the soil (body) with linen and ointments (medications), as we have here described.
The other aspect of the operation is fearful and far-flung, which Gualia and Luce carry out for great praise; this concerns you in your participation wherein it becomes necessary to discover the part of the bone at which a forceful and manifest fracture has been placed, once discovered, pause briefly with that gentle and cheerful limb deformation from whence this is formed.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "For the lunar disc is like a lion and has no cause for itself, and its sharp division into two lozenges beforehand in lengthiness; so that the lunar disc fits with the facial incision made on the bone.
Here comes the first sentence to translate:
When there is any additional cause associated with the patient'thy knee joint in certain bone locations, insert that item into their extremity where it fits and remove it easily; for once removed from its place of harm and fear, removal becomes less difficult.
If the bone does not penetrate into the periosteum, and what has broken off or remains of the bone is its face, there are roughnesses and fine threads in it; therefore take care that these roughnesses and thread-like structures be removed by means you have prepared for this purpose from various quantities so as to make their administration throughout all convenient places on them possible. And place each one precisely according to the time when your operation is complete, thus healing both the broken bone and the figure of the person.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May there be any small or subtle breaks in the vessels and bones that you must administer treatment according to what has been lost for correction.
It is because they have not been properly managed or treated in that area of study. When we have shown great breaks in it (presumably referring back to a previously discussed injury or condition), now proceed as follows:
If the pancreas is swolthy when you remove the bone, then take hold of its cloth as much as there's foulness (impurity) on it and immerse that in roasted oil; place such immersed one onto another piece of fabric or even more layers if needed, submerge this too into water mixed with olive oil. Rest the affected organ upon these fabrics to prevent infestation by parasites which can harm his constitution furthermore; apply treatment on those liniments (medicated cloths), and only tighten it as much that there's just enough space for the foulness/impurity within its cavity.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When these powders of such medicine are dried and pulverized, apply them over the ground, in any case when they are dry; universally, administer it throughout this entire medicinal property to prevent consumption and biting.
Guard your second nature so that the child in its care is clean; and do not use ointment or any other on it; nor shall you add virulence to it; when adjusted over the pancreas of the brain, corrupts that part and poisons it with malevolent malice.
When the pain reaches the skull as it is being oiled and most prominent when you are presenting your treatment to them; then consider whether these accidents that have happened affect their entire body in one piece.
If it is not the black bile causing pain but from that medicine which has been suspended above, and this comes down as such dark matter, then take some honey and oil-rosined portions in three parts; drape them over these lines, and place one part on each of those points where pressure should be applied. Also apply care by using the healing spices that you deem necessary so that it may recover.
Capitol III.: (This line does not provide content for translation
When a nose bone is broken, it translates roughly as "When the nosebone gets fractured." Here's
Realize that the nosebone is not broken into pieces but rather has parts dislocated and placed sideways; these are referred to as spinal deformities, which do not break or fracture it in place—instead leading to twisting, curvature (scoliosis), and bowing.
If one of the legs' bones is broken, then you insert a small object into their nose and grasp it with your teeth at the place indicated by them, holding until they return to their normal body shape through their nose. If it is necessary for your aid (water or other remedy), and ensure that you do not harm the patient'thy thighs during thy operation thereon.
If the fracture is in the upper chest portion of the ribs and does not move towards it, then cover it with a piece from where the end or tip of that bone segment lies on which is larger than usual.
If the bone is broken into parts, then make it seem as though that's what you have found.
And if the hernia remains in your body on the first day of rupture, try to restore it; otherwise, give rest for seven or eight days after the period of post-rupture healing (crawling).

This cause is not necessary for you; if you wish, then make it happen, and if desired even more so, apply heat accordingly.
If you have other purulent inflammation to drain with caution using a heated or boiled sponge in oil and water vinegar (or honey), do so carefully.
If you do not remove the suppuration with caution, then place some wheat flour and barley powder mixed in alum (alcoholic solution of potassium sulfate); spread it over that spot where a lion stoops down to rest—there shall be no cause for concern.
May if the bones of the nose are slightly broken or displaced, then cut over those areas with instruments I have designated for them; and take care of that portion where it is fractured/displaced, using fluid suitable to encapsulate and consolidate, as well as applying proper dressings.
If you crush a worm from the nose, then take care of that with some warmth and introduce catheters made of lead inside so that it may heal completely in health.
Unfortunately, without additional context or understanding of what "Capitol .ii
When referring to the treatment for a fractured jaw ("restoratio" being Latin in origin), this line likely pertains to dental
When the jawbone has become misaligned and broken (not yet crushed into pieces), consider if this can be corrected with only one intervention; it should not have twisted at its divisions either: in such a case, your knowledge or expertise is lacking ("leugiera"). This implies that proper diagnosis may sometimes require professional medical judgment beyond basic understanding.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the jawbone is broken into two pieces, then provide extension of parts as necessary so that it may be possible for him to eat (or chew).
If you press the gums for dislocation, then apply pressure to those of which you hope will come out (the displaced teeth) from gold or silver or yield; and put your hand over the broken jawbone crack, as well as on top of the double cloth wrap, where a single tongue rests along the length of the broken jawbone—and apply pressure therein according to how you are dressed in (the medical attire), so that it is not destroyed.
And command the humors that they should rest and calm down, so as not to consume food by sucking it like a lion.
If your figure has become distorted due to any malady, then take care of it today and rectify what is already altered in you; apply the remedy that has been changed from this or place honey (or egg white), bran flakes on top—keep a cloth over the dressing made of lamb'se wool.
And when that bandage is applied and adjusted on the body without altering its position, so long as it remains healed and strong for a three-day period, this indicates continued care to ensure proper recovery of the fracture.
If another wound occurs after poultice application, apply what we have mentioned for these ulcers within that space to heal it and treat the said sore ulceration.
If the fracture is in bone, consider if it' extricable from the os or separated (fractured), then you should remove those pieces that are suited for returning to where they belong within the skeleton during its recovery period.
If the poultice applied on the patient is insufficiently spread out, then expand it according to your need using a finger at the foot of the bed (the pulpotomist).
When you have removed those satagias (likely referring to a poultice or some form of healing agent), and there is no more drainage from them, apply the plague if it' extraneous; otherwise, pause over that which seems most appropriate among your instruments for treating this condition. Enter until they are cured.
Capitalize (referring possibly to an initial or title of something

When moving or carrying excessively is broken the shoulder blade of the patient and that fracture occurs in one of three ways (implying there are likely different types of dislocation or injury to describe):
When broken or separated in parts not accessible for treatment, it is the end of healing (restoration), and when sickened within those fragments, recovery becomes difficult, and it resembles being born again (like a newborn).
When the operation is performed in that way, it means you make two servants present; one holds his hand to assist and supports the broken sternum at that place of separation.
Return the bone in its position where it has been broken until you have set its shape according to how much was damaged and ensure there is neither a peak nor indentation left on top of it.
If indigestion persists beyond its extension, then take pauses slowly with a cloth or wool swaddle according to your need; and raise the chest and compress the swaddle as directed by me when you pause.

May you feel tightness in the shoulder and neck (furcula), which are uncomthy [unpleasant] for you, so that when you cut into those areas it is done easily to alleviate them.
If it is held in the bone, then you will create an incision on one of those joints which has been prepared for this purpose (likely referring to a surgical procedure), and place your pause briefly at the sternum where the chest-plate serves as support; herein lies its form:
It seems like the text is about medical practices in medieval times related to joint pain and treatment methods:
May the length of him be as much as it is within your power for surgery; that he has two limbs with joints to operate on, one wide and stretched out, another contracted or narrowed.
If the disruption of the seed you inserted when extracting the splinter is wide and at risk for infection, then securely fasten the wound with suture material on the flesh around it.
If the displacement is slight, or if you fear an abscess formation and must apply dressings as per the quantity of the dislocation'se gap:
If you lance an abscess with a cauterous instrument, then apply heat and oil on it, and rest upon that area.
Here is the line by line translation:
Return the sleep of the patient's thigh over their chest bone (the sternum), and gently tap them down to make sure they fall asleep there at night, so that someone else can assist in lifting him/her up from this position; thus his/her collarbone is raised due to elevation of the muscle or because the arm lies on their chest.

In this translation process for an archaic text that blends elements
The restoration of a shoulder fracture refers to the medical procedures and treatments aimed at healing a broken bone in the
The restoration of a shoulder fracture involves fixing what is cracked within its depth, rather than at the edge; here, 'spatula' (likely referring to medical tools or splints used in treatment) has been broken and not simply crushed along the edges as might
So when the location of the body — specifically, where there is damage due to frost or cold (likely referring to fracture from trauma) and not simply broken edges as observed by touch, it's after careful examination that you understand how to prepare for treatment; hereby reducing what has been damaged according to its natural form in a manner which allows for the possibility of healing.
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English: Place padding over the powder of moist clay and albumen, then place a folded cloth pad; above all apply pressure on it according to the amount that can be scraped out by the entirety or possibly one spatula.
If the stone is concave in some of the places on the scalpel, then grasp that indentation with your thumb and press down as if handling a lion' extrication tool (hinting at using force to remove stones or unwanted material), and adjust the blade accordingly for equal pressure distribution.
Return strength from below upwards, away from the contraction and closure of bone joints to prevent them within their place again.
Consider the ligament each day; and every time it is softened, treat it again and strengthen its tendons if they have swolthyed from their place.
When they lay down their malady upon themselves (their body), it means that patients are subjecting or placing their illness onto themselves, likely referring met
The sentence in Spanish translates to English as "It is restored in xx days or x.x." Here 'xx' and '.xxv' represent numerical values that would specify the duration
Translation: So when this number is completed, you will melt the ligament (ligaments), and understand that it's safe from those bones which I started not to fear or wish for its dissolution. The sentence appears to discuss a procedure involving some kind of physical manipulation where one must be cautious about certain elements—likely referring specifically to parts within an organism, such as ligaments around bones in the context of medieval medicine.
If you proceed from the bone of the shoulder and gently press on the collarbone, hold it firmly, then when we have discussed what has been mentioned about the fracture of the sternum due to ossification cram if there is pain here:
The provided text appears to be an ancient medical treatise in Old Occitan or
Regarding the healing of a bone fracture.
The joints of some parts are broken in the warmth location, and perhaps even their limbs may be twisted or crushed there.

If the backbone fracture is declining into parts, it causes severe pain and piercing sensation as if you are puncturing someone who has cried out; for this reason put your arm under their shoulder (implied by "os ponh le velament"), they may have difficulty breathing ("difficultat de hanelit") with coughs and vomiting of phlegm, which is a difficult condition to heal.
Even then, they become engineers in that heavy matter.
Here come the reasons they state: that which pauses foods of malaute (presumably an excess or dysfunction within "malaute") causes inflammation and agitation, thus expanding the belly and driving the fracture to its extremities.

The sentence in question is indeed Italian and pertains to issues following vertebral (spinal) fractures of the thoracic or lumbar regions ("osses du col" refers to "bones of the back," where 'col' typically means spine, especially when discussing structural integrity). The patient may experience continued pain after such an injury and appear similar in symptoms to those with The Italian sentence provided relates to the assessment of a spinal fracture's healing potential ("cum accideys ad alcu"). The speaker considers that if there is little or no improvement and sensation returns, it indicates non-healing (non articular) bone fragments. These are immobilized with wires connected to pins when the vertebrae become unstable; patients would not experience pain in these areas due to nerve damage ("no sent en aquelas dolor"). The prognosis for such injuries, especially after surgical intervention involving rods and screws (“mes de disposicios”), can be poor.
If the moisture and pain are present in those places and through piercing or making holes, you will understand that the bone of the body is saved and humors circulate properly for curative purposes.

The bones of the broad [bones] are broken (fractured), and if they break, then their separation is only communication between those extremities; placed in length and decline towards parts—therefore injuries at that location cause pain which causes fainting." This line appears to discuss a condition where there's trauma or injury leading to bone breaks. The mention of "communication" suggests the breakage might lead not only to localized issues but also affect mobility and possibly circulation, as indicated by subsequent descriptions ("and pain at that location causes fainting") which could relate symptoms resulting from significant physical trauma or injury requiring medical attention for restoration.
The restoration of him is that you stretch your hand over whatsothy are upon the bone which forms his figure.

Capitolo XII (where "XII" stands for chapter number twelve in
The translation of the given Latin-influenced text into English regarding bone fracture treatment is as follows:
The text describes the anatomy of a bone with two parts: one small and referred to as "the little finger," while the other is large and called "that which remains when you rest" from where it originates—implying that this could be referring to how certain muscles or structures contribute during healing. Here's an attempted translation into modern English, keeping in mind some of these terms are old-f0rmed medical language:
When either the great fire (possibly referring to a fever or high body temperature) is broken only once and their fractures occur simultaneously:
When the small fire below is extingdicted (truncated), then its restoration will be easier for him/her to endure, and his/her healing process becomes lighter.
When the patient's fire (a metaphorical term for vitality or life force) is extingubated evenly and suddenly, their bone breaks are bad, making healing difficult.
When that bone from it was broken or fractured.
So if the bone that is broken it's the small one above (presumably referring to a specific part of the skeleton), then as a doctor, you must restore it quickly for ease until such time when this has healed in place again.
May it be that if a large fire is what we are witnessing (the heat from the fever), then I have pushed back with forceful extension.
If the two fires burn together intensely, then it is necessary for you to stop their removal forcefully.
When the figure of your hand must be rested and extended over a limb (a "cushion"), then place it on their legs where the body parts are located below, putting all others in those places as well, and positioning ears with other ones placed by them, while placing the head atop another one'dictated.
When a hernia is present undernethy or in the lower part of it, to ensure that the intestine does not worsen.
Extend the arm of the party that was pushed down by force from above or below, and another minister extends outwards as if appearing.
When the doctor applies pressure to the bone within that which best suits, following its superior form as far as possible.
If in the bone'supremacy you have caused all pain within it at your location with your virtue,
If there appears in the patient separate drops that press on the spine and it's not within your hope for recovery to restore them as directed from below, then you must attend upon these yourself according to our guidance.
If the bone is broken and thus has entered into a single pool of moisture (indicating an open or severe wound), then take up its specific care (medical attention).
If you cool an ulcer at the site of your remaining healing with clean linen soaked in oil and white wax, drape it between delicacy and strictness; cover that spot where the ulcer has been applied until it subsides; then remove the cloth and apply a poultice made from crushed chalk mixed with lime powder prepared as plaster. And place pressure on this stone stopping its movement over the fracture you have laid down and set firmly.
Be aware that the names of the bones in the arm are found in major positions or as a break at one focus (fracture) or two foci (bones).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Here comes the translation of each line:
Consider the body part (the limb) with its softened flesh today. If there is any cause that requires correction in the limb where it hurts, and you apply pressure on this area until the pain subsides from that pressing.
And let it not be tightened within until rested, and return its constriction.
If extraction has been softened and the bone seems to those as beforehand, then straighten all of it according to your will.
Consider if the nourishment is prohibited to prevent harming the limb due to excessive tightness; when that occurs, soften it slightly for several days until you can provide that sustenance again.
If in the malady there is not any cause of what we have said, do not attempt to draw it out within twenty days or beyond those mentioned by us.
Return its belly attached for its active motion and make it sleep on their backs.
You understand that this fracture is healed in either xxx days or xxxii days, and all of this depends on the complexity of the injuries and the disposition of the vitality. (Note: "xxx", "xxxii" and "xxviii" are placeholders for actual numbers representing specific time frames which should be filled with appropriate numerical values.)
In order to provide an accurate translation of "Capitol .xiii.,
Regarding the repair of the bone fragment in the finger and toe, it would translate roughly as:
Understand that when there is pain in the knee and groin due to joint stress or injury, it requires careful attention rather than causing harm.
When you have made the fracture or atrophy worse and thus far increased it by tenfold as equality requires, place your hand over that extension to prevent further increase.
Extend the minister'dicts (or refers) those broken bones which are in good conjunction or properly connected together, as determined by the doctor.
And when you apply plaster and bandage, if it does not alleviate the festering ulceration immediately, then stop applying pressure according to the size of the wound area; by now you have wrapped that in cloth coverings.
If the injury is in the parts below your navel and it appears like drape threads, then make that area tight with belt as commanded by the abdomen'thy hand (belly), making the waistband long.
And if it is necessary for the body's core (the chest) to be covered by a sheet wherein it stands up, tighten that second layer around it so that the body remains in place on the palm.
May it be that if the fracture is at the extremities (the parts beyond), then pause below the stone and another of those stones from within the part itself in the palm, so that your hand becomes covered and tightened; also pause the swelling, as when you turn your body towards the hilt between the limbs.
If you break the bones of your fingers, when it hurts in your finger, then do as follows: apply pressure with both hands on its small stone (the little toe), and if you wish to pause for a while so that the fracture is raised and not swolthy.
If the fracture is in any of those places mentioned here (hip, navel, ear, ankle), then apply pressure to that joint with your hand as if you were doing so on this spot; or leave it resting for some time until completely healed, and better yet – place a small stone over the area where we'm currently pressing our finger.
Consider in your restoration, and apply that which is a cautionary application or opposition—a necessary part of the operation when addressing any cause brought forth by their story as it unfolds (interpreted).
The provided text seems to be from an old medical manuscript or treatise
Restauración (or repair) of the hip bone.
The bones of the thighs grind constantly and it is declared according to what has become in the lower abdomen below, near the place where urine exits.
The restoration of him is done so that the sinew (ligament) tightens over the fracture, and another ligament just afterward; his humerus lies down on his stomach and face.
Whenever it is necessary for the minister (doctor) to extend fully along their assigned area according to quality when the fracture occurs in the bone'dictly at that spot of time and place:
May it be necessary for the ligament to come into play at the knee joint'supremacy_, thus extending its function in their and another bandage thereafter as soon as a break occurs._
If the joint injury is suitable for ligaments (meaning that it can be healed by them), then apply the said ligament to the dislocation and extend it to the affected parts immediately.
Here the doctor applies cold to the two joints below in such a way that they reduce it according to its natural appearance and join them well through good conjunction; provided he does not worsen an appendicitis condition of the member. If there is an ulceration present, then you should apply that for several days until the ulcer heals, and return to your care routine.
The contracture of him is painful: cover that which wraps around the fracture with hard bandage, and fold it twice or thrice for some days; reduce superfluous covering until it reaches up to the ankle and knee joints.
Here the long linen is inserted between the thigh and the specially made sling at the hip joints of each section, and their extremities are wrapped with this thread that remains from the bandages; they then rotate it over the sling and thigh as needed.
Return your hand pressure over the area of that fracture and place a stone pillow on their shoulder bone above the knee joint.
Return and fill the empty spaces between the sheet (drape) and thighs with molasses to ensure that bleeding stops.
Here begins the treatment of a severe sprain over the site of the broken bone encased in three or four layers, and as you move away from the location of the fracture, your tightness decreases, so apply less pressure and moisten it.
Return the limbs of the foot to their respective parts until they reach the cavity of the leg, and tighten your arms with those of another person's tools for that it does not escape its place again.
Here comes the translation:
If the bone within the bone is touched and you must touch it (if possible to do so), then press on that spot; otherwise, apply pressure there until relief comes, taking care of what has been remembered before healing time as a remedy for this condition.

You understand that in the hamstring there are two bones which one is large and they are called 'hamstring'; while the other is small and it's known as a tendon or sinew (clavicle). The translation provided captures aspects of anatomy, specifically identifying parts within what can be referred to as "the hamstring," where two bones—one large ("es gros") likely referring to one leg’seye(either the femur from below in this context) and
And as for the spices of bone breakage in both arms (implying a condition affecting more than one limb), you fix them similarly to how you would heal an arm overall, and this is what your operation entails. The translation here suggests that remedies or interventions used are not just limited to the treatment on each bone but consider the entire affected area (the arms). It points out a holistic approach in treating fractures—focusing attention on both individual injuries and overall function, which aligns with medieval practices where physicians often considered physical restoration within its broader context.
If you have broken two bones together in the hamstring, it is converted into all parts of that area—implying complete fracturing where each fragment might require individual attention for repair or healing within this context. This translation reflects an understanding consistent with medieval
If one of the small bones (possibly referring to sesamoid or smaller elements within tendons) is fractured in the hamstring area, it becomes converted into parts—likely suggesting that such an injury might result in multiple fragments requiring different treatment strategies as denoted
If you have broken your large bone, then make that repair immediately, and it is from these causes that are not within your control.

When a bone fracture is healed, and the refined parts of the body (the skeleton) and joints are returned to their position: at this time it'se not pain caused by motions but rather due to these reasons: one reason being excessive dryness from exposure in sunlight; or because nutrition is prohibited for the limb to run freely within its cavity; or due to an excess of obesity, and/or sudden movements outside their natural time. Or it could be poor digestion in the intestine's belly (perhaps indicating constipation), or debilitation caused by heat entering through pores and leaking outward:
Care for the humors involves draining excess from the malady and making the patient'thy blood soft within so that it may multiply there, administer baths, and place poultices of grease and liniment on them.
Apply pressure on the limb so that it draws in nourishment or continues with its own fluid discharge until the nourishment circulates back to restore the body'se natural shape and condition.
In order to provide an accurate translation for "Capitol .xxii.",
From restoration of the fractured bones gently and forbidding any operation from them now:
When you have restored the health of your limb affected by twisting and elevation of the bone, as well as its shape being compromised, although it is not forbidden for this body part to undergo natural surgery operations; furthermore, do not fear that which exists in such a member now (possibly having arisen anew),
May also stand as witnesses among doctors and innkeepers who have used this operation, which is seen by many to be lost due to great fear of its name.
When limping and knots are recent, it is said that they were submerged in the water basin where their hernias lie, as if they'll be soaked with warm wine vinegar or oil of cedars; similar substances will also accompany them—and such treatment consists either of mollifying plastering applied and reapplied to these wounds (with healing ointment), or a poultice made from the pith of juniper berries, linseed grease, and chestnut leaves used for those herbs designated by wise women as consolidating tonics.
Some substances are dissolved by continuous exposure to cold wind that affects the body in all its parts throughout the entire day and night.
May it be that dislocation is coming soon and becomes painful and necessitates care with a fork (possibly for repositioning), provided the patient's fluid has escaped from below the joint capsule, continuously dissolving bone tissue, causing excess fluid above this area of joint destruction, which then overflows downwards; simultaneously, additional fluids secreted by that specific doctor are administered with ease in response to their request and study.
Capitol .xxiii.: This line appears to be referencing a specific section
From discourse on displacement/dislocation: The phrase "de sermo in dislocatio
Dislocation is an injury to any of the joints such that there's no motion allowed, and it necessitates medical attention; this leads to pain in the humors (fluids within) causing severe discomfort or issues: Here we discuss injuries involving a loss of movement at body joints which require immediate treatment. The term "malaute" likely refers to an accumulation of what medieval physicians believed were pus-like fluids inside the swollen and painful area, although from our modern understanding this could be related more broadly to infl
Therefore when one experiences a joint dislocation, it is crucial to apply pressure immediately so that the limb may be reset; if not promptly done, there will likely occur detachment and make anesthesia difficult for rectifying such injuries: If timely action isn't taken following a suspected dislocation of a body part, one might encounter difficulties in treating it due to pain. The urgency highlighted here underscores the need for quick intervention when joint dislocations are present or feared as they can lead complications if not treated rapidly and properly by medical professionals (metges). This line emphasizes that delaying treatment could result in further issues with anesthesia, making it
Therefore there is nothing to apply pressure or bandage during the detachment phase; however, if movement continues afterward, muscle spasms and worsening pain will occur: This line suggests that once a joint has been dislocated (leading potentially to its 'detachment'), immediate application of any remedies like compression may not be advisable. The continued mobility or strain on the affected area post-dislocation can result in muscle sp
When the fluid becomes acidic, cover yourself with flaxseed oil poultice application inside and outside of healing period repairs; place your limb in water to ease it back into shape.
The entire body part is cured by the water from which memory will return in its place.
And when the displacement occurs as described after the fracture, it enters from one division of the body into another divided portion.

The provided English translation appears to be a direct interpretation of the medieval Latin medical text concerning jaw dislocations (mandibular displacement). Here is an attempt at translating it line by line:
May when the displacement of it is little, in major positions returns for itself a little cause.
May it be that if there is a complete and total dislocation, then immediately administer the reduction of limb lengthening without delay.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If it is difficult to reduce him/her (the patient), and mostly if both jaws are dislocated, administer enema water or oil inside until the reduction of both has been achieved; thus having what we have said before.
When they return with their mouths sealed and the patient'thy groin is not soothed (not softened), on those cloth pills, wax and oil are used for its relief; in this way, his tongue becomes easier to clean by means of a spoon.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When it is administered easily, and you should not work on the opening of the mouth for eating and drinking until the jawbone is numbed and healed inside.
If it is difficult to reduce two dislocated jaws at once and not convertible during the times when they are displaced, you will be advised for prolonged fevers and constant thirsting, and forcefully press upon the abdomen of the malady, and frequently vomit pure blood.
When you take it again, then realize that I have lost it; and continue taking it for the duration of which I took it before.

When translating the Latin-influenced medieval medical sentence, it appears to describe a procedure related to shoulder and limb injuries:
The fur finally is not dislocated from the joint due to continuous pressure on the hip; and sometimes it becomes dislocated in the lower region, which is declared by feeling.
The restoration of him is that the malady presses upon his two legs and extends their muscles. And crush the location with your hand, which will then return or heal by itself.
Return your hand above that plaster and dust or splinters therein tightly, ensuring no loose objects remain within it.
May the extremity that is between those who sit and continue to be so, not become dislocated on any day; provided it has been reduced and manipulated according to what we have said and as per your apparatus.
Here applies pressure on that bandage, and friction, and extraction; commands the humors to settle into tranquility and rest within so that it may heal.
At this moment of caregiving, the extent of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Given that "Capitol" does not appear to be text from a
The reduction of the muscle dislocation involves carefully manipulating the affected area back into its proper position, typically by healthcare professionals with expertise in physical
The statement describes three ways in extranjero is the one whereby it becomes misplaced either at once from rest or immediately afterward:
And it is that he has been displaced from the upper part of the muscle, and pain occurs here too; and not in the parts behind for the shoulder joint nor forward along with the nerves.
Mostly it is a displacement and evacuation from the parts at the end of labor pains, mainly in those where the bones are thin; sometimes however when there'mats have moved bones out, it occurs with difficulty.
And when the limb is hurting from cold dampness being pressed upon it with an acute hammer or cast, and its muscle has been struck by apothecary'se cautery leading to a displacement (dislocation), then apply pressure here where it was dislocated.
Now that you have said what has entered while being overly seated upon it (the patient), and now proceed with the healing of this individual.
Here comes the first source sentence translated line by line into English:
If it is a displacement of either feet or shoulders, and you show treatment without fear, do not hesitate.
From this displacement one suffers light reduction when it becomes cool and humors descend into the malady.
The reduction of the patient is for the minister to raise their body parts above them and apply gentle pressure on the tender spots where they tap it, lifting that joint in its strength back into place; then he raises that part again and extends it there, applying pressure gradually until return.
May it not return, and since dislocation has occurred within days, let the swelling of the patient's limb be immersed in tail water and administered with broth made from black cumin (Nigella sativa), fenugreek (Trigonella sinensis) seeds soaked in water, which is also given to their joint where fractures are healing.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you wish to reduce that second symptom according to this treatment: and make present a long home (probably referring to warmth or heat therapy), which is from there, and insert your muscle quickly with the thrust of the hernia, lifting it above where the hernia rests in air; another servant will pull out the mass from within its divisions immediately after. If the patient' extrusion is loose, then I must know that another cause has made it suspended, and when this occurs, it returns suddenly.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another reduction method is as follows: lay a long staff on which figure can be drawn, similar to a mortar' extrusion that should not be thick nor subtle; position it above the patient's waist holding the stock with hands atop of it, while hernia sits along the length of the staff. Extend your arm over immediately the other part for strengthening and extension purposes so as to return constriction swiftly back to its original place.
If the reduction of it is difficult for all causes mentioned above, then use this treatment: grasp a staff with its length equal to two arm' extrices (the extendable part between your elbow and wrist), hold that stick at four digits away from each other, positioning the patient accordingly according to these instructions:
E place your hand over the head to ensure that nothing happens with their bowels related to the malady (illness).
Here is the translation of each line:
Above the arm on a scale according to latitude, and her hand is extended over parts just now, while another holds it from the other part until their joint comes together soon.
When the internal matter is completed according to any possible way that it can be done by you, and after pausing occasionally for your patient's sinew of wool sponge with varying quantities; apply an emplastrum prepared from plaster mixed with molasses and egg white over all muscle layers so as they may turn upside down above the skin layer; twist the ligament around this compress, attach it to your patient's chest (presumably for stabilization), wrap their body securely without making it sound noisy during application, which should last about seven days.
When food of the malady is sparingly taken, and thus resting comforts are given to the body, then it approaches healing for him/her.
Return food that is given more abundantly in days seven or eight and engage it with exercise; therefore if one stops exergy (the life force) from stiffening without softening treatment, healing will occur.
May it be that if the joint is dislocated due to humidity or another cause, then in that case three kinds of treatments are applied as prescribed in the text on treatment methods.
If all at once there is pain and seven days are set for removing the bandage and joint union not closed, and plasters/strapping applied several times on it reduce swelling (and loosen constriction), you understand that patient'n nerves which run down to muscle head, either sprained or extended/softened by these measures, have never been fixed in place.
Of the dislocation of that which is being felt in your hips and breastbone or lower parts, reduction is by forceful thrusting and extension until return occurs.
And when applied in that other constriction, it treats until healed therein.
If you worsen the condition of health in their limb and delay their movement, let that humoral imbalance be cleansed through frequent baths until such an imbalance is relieved and returns to its original natural state.

Of the shoulder joint being misaligned and appearing as difficulty; it is dislocated in all parts, primarily at the part between where one's body ends and another begins (likely referring to a dislocation occurrin on or near the clavicle), which cannot be manipulated back into place without immediate intervention by someone with medical expertise. Whenever you adjust this misaligned shoulder joint that has been thrown out of alignment, it is evidently manifest; for then its natural curvature will not allow bending of one's arm nor touching their own muscle in such a way as described (likely indicating restricted movement). Here the translation breaks down line by line:
When you find the hernia, reduce it as much so that it heals with cautery; if a cauterization is done on the patient, difficultly its reduction cannot be achieved entirely and not fully healthful—particularly when located behind in other species of displacement and greater pain, accompanied by movements tending toward death.
When the patient'thy restoration is possible, it happens that their body should be extended with both hands and arms spread out; and the doctor stands over thighs and knees of the patient holding his/her hands or pressing on the palm between them to return in position.
If the dislocation is at the joints ahead, return it quickly by folding your hand into its place until you hear a click in the area of its movement (on their palm).
If displacement does not submit to reduction, then apply vigorous extension and motion forcefully.
When two ministers stretch out their arms and hold that instrument of them together, thus preventing excessive extension;
When you rotate his arm completely, placing a long cloth wrapped in lint over the area of him, or bandage it with sinew (the word "liament" refers to an animal-based cord used for binding).
When the doctor touches the joint, anoint that with some oil to help alleviate its causes and apply pressure on it vigorthy until it returns naturally.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And for its reduction that has been paused on top of which there is adhesion and effusion in the album filled with humors, and it extends out due to strictures, with the arm suspended from the collarbone; this condition rests upon pillows.
And it is cut down; and therefore, if the joint is formed in that place, you should cut the ligament of him therein and apply such to that.
If you see the joint not strengthened (or perhaps weakened), then apply the plaster and bandage repeatedly for several days until it is extended outwards, and after that remove them.
If you apply gravity for the reduction of the joint and its position is in motion, then administer moisture with warmth and cold subtlety carefully until it's alleviated; when pressure is applied at the fatty abdomen movement area, securely fasten it there, letting that rest on the bone during day and night. Return that one and immerse the other in the bath; when sweating begins at the cold joint, frequently rub it with fregula (cold towel) while being agitated by motion, on this day's meal for relief as well as later today. When bathing is entered wherein it enters into one's body (presumably a soaking or immersion), then this occurs within one'
And if you wish to pause over that damp and gashed hole by the water's edge (likely referring to an area near water where injuries might happen), place your foot upon it; then give some rest, after which this wound becomes moistened again but is restored in its proper condition.

Regarding the care for joint displacement between the arm and body, it is at the junction where these two parts meet. (This translation aims to preserve the meaning of the original text in English while attempting to understand medieval medical terminology.)
Malasse some of the bones are displaced, and the reduction of this dislocation is difficult; it may be that speed in reducing them at the time they become displaced will prevent an open wound (apostema cutis).
The reduction of the dislocation is that you stop the joint between the groin and thigh on a table and extend it from there; the doctor places their hand or palm over the impending joint, pressing it back into place until it returns to its proper location.
Whenever the palm is found to be pressed against the belly of her, then hernia pause on both sides of her body above a table for extension and reduction; if dislocation precedes must place her position so that her abdomen rests upon that intrinsic surface atop the table, ensuring doctor' extrication from impending joint juncture.
And if it returns soon, good; but if not, that part may become inflamed and must be treated without delay as long clogs persist beyond three days.
Even though the knee joint according to its curvature; and there is not any cause in the belly, but it is soothed and cannot contract due to itself—you understand that the nerves are twisted or spasmed, and only when you strike with cautery specifically for this purpose and strengthen the water'dictions of your treatment will provide a reason.
So when they are returned indoors again, place the compress we have prepared on them, and keep it bound tightly for days; also cut off their clothing and exercise that part of them daily.
If the patient is immobile and experiences pain in them or some weight pressures down on him, then apply this: gently to their tailbone (anus) and parts of warmth as exergy shifts occur; until he/she becomes relieved.

When any of these bones in the hand or abdomen is displaced (dislocated), it must be held and pushed back into place within which they should return to their original position; ensuring that this action restores proper alignment ("retorna"). Here are line-bys per sentence translated:

If it is a staff given in which he turns and rotates between the two sticks of his arms, then so be it.

Capitol XXVI.
Of hip joint dislocation treatment.
You understand that the joint between the thigh and the muscle does not collapse entirely but is dislocated only slightly, and you do not worsen it by applying pressure to these other small joints of concave structure.
The joint of the wide is dislocated according to four ways: it's dislocated at the divisions of the bones, or in front of them, or behind them, or below them.
Mostly they are dislocated in parts of bones and scarcely at joints ahead or behind.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When that person'supremacyisdislocatedtothepartsbehind,itindicatesthatthoseaccidentsofhearecontrarytomanyoftimes(sometimes).
When the limb that has been dislocated is spread out again with a cushion as supplementary support, it may still experience pain at the joint area; if further movement occurs and cannot be done there anymore; urine retention happens in him/her, hernia becomes evident by protrusion (in this case), he needs to walk on his ankle.
E senha da pessoa a quem se deteriorou as partes traseiras é tal que não expande o dedil, nem pode dobrar essaquele antecedente que doubrem os engoncos; e colocamos uma espécie de cama para ele delicadamente, com outra servindo sobre suas pernas, fazendo-o sentir a mão no peito.
Mays reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and when the dislocation is old and ancient, which has already been addressed by your current administration here at our house (according to its disposition), it's not part of this entire treatment; thus, there will be no more effects. And now that means a conclusion or end in sight for these remedies you have administered so far.
In the place where dislocation occurred recently and it is one of the four species of dislocation, take hold of that which has come loose (the joint) and bring back its connection to both sides parts intact as well as between them, ensuring strength in both right and left. Once this action is taken, there'm no need for other treatments at all.
May it be so in this manner, if the patient does not return to bedown hereafter: then have you ready a strong cup or pill for dispensing; place under their legs immediately after departure as soon as possible (or alternatively at regular intervals), and also on their chest. Another servant extends that above-mentified substance from below, carrying it upward so they can touch the top of their head with this medicine when desired; firmly hold a leather strap or similar item for supporting over the neck portion while doing such action (holding hands).
When there is extension from the area of the heart or between the shoulder blade and lower back portion of the thorax, it indicates an angina in that region.
When all of these are extended for as long as the hump is lifted from the ground and begins to descend,
This particular form of extension is common among all four (Italian/Spanish). In this context, "especial" and "speciale" are cognates found in Italian ("special")
And so if the dislocation returns as we have said, it is bad (serra bol); otherwise, you will need all of the remedies that relate specifically to your treatment needs. Here "dislocacio" refers to a joint or ligament injury where there has been displacement ("retorna") which could indicate either partial return after reduction/treatment or complete failure necessitating further intervention, and “propria curació” suggests personalized medical
In performing the reduction on oneself when dislocated, and wherein (ligaments) are torn apart as we have indicated above, so that the malady may be repositioned over one's own abdomen; placing restraint in between areas of the chest cavity at which point it lies near/between neck and shoulder joint—where tendons should lie across from arm partition to furcula (forehead bone). Here, "reducció" indicates self-administered or basic external manipulation aiming for realignment. The text describes a method whereby one must manually guide the dislocated part back into place using body posture ("repositionar le malady"), potentially applying pressure at specific points between chest and shoulder to relocate tendons that have been damaged (“liamentz”) by trauma, with an emphasis on self-care for injury management.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
This specific is of purulent nature that heals this member, which other substances do not have the ability to accomplish.
May it be that you can rest on us and not disobey this special form of healing, for the two legs at the hips are linked together tightly by ligament, bone, both thighs and knees.
Whenever any part of his body has a length corresponding to four digits and the groin extends as far as two digits' lengths, it is time for action according to our doctrine.
Return the patient'dictum (their humors) to the head of the chest and ensure it is in balance; this length corresponds to two cubits from the ground.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "E aprop comanda a un jove fort que minimice el cap de la cosse, y estie suspendido amb otro joye en le malaute; e l'altre joye minuciarà la coyssa al forteza empellesca, quan retorna ao seu lugar rápida.
In the reduction itself, when it is dislocated from behind, where the hump of the belly presses on its back as per our recommendations in the abdominal gelatin; and his sinew rests directly on the hollow malady and chest properly.
Here comes the sentence to translate: And place two sticks as restraints; one for the patient's feet and another on their head; set these stick positions according to where the heating pad, which covers them with warmth, lies upon whatbedclothes they wear. This way, preventing pressure sores from occurrdragging between the thighs of the patient will not occur.
Every minister extends to his/her own portion; it is for this reason that the doctor uses their tongue to perform reduction according to art.
When the dislocation occurs in these parts now, then cover that couch is extended; and as for this treatment method described by them, the doctor places his right palm on the lower abdomen of the patient, and props up one hand against the other to support it, ensuring that when he compresses there between hands, he does so at the dislocation site.
If dislocation is at the joints behind, they do not cover up so that the malady spreads to the parts ahead and rises onto the ground; there are those who hold it stopped if the patient's thigh is also dislocated from the joints forward, as we have said about two anchors supporting its face. There should be no restraint on this matter, according to what has been discussed hereinabove.
When compression is applied over the location where pain occurs at the joint.
So when the reduction is complete, as indicated by "cover," and your name for this procedure isn't trouble—meaning you should extend from thighs with cushions placed therein; once again, repeat those steps, expanding that which has been tightened outwardly until it fits snugly without discomfort in any part of the body. Then adjust hips and pause to fix bandages firmly—and maintain pressure on a belt around your waist for three or four days so as not for expansion (swelling) anywhere else, ensuring you keep everything still during this period.
Return the sinew and binding back together, comparing one cushion with another.
And if you see those wounds in the bedclothes, know that the dislocation is already closed, and therefore let the humors flow out of it.
If you see any cause of moisture (indicating some form of damp or fluid accumulation), then return and bandage that area according to your first treatment technique, and leave it there for three days.
Return that part of it now, and allow him to walk slowly on these crutches for as many days until he is comfortable.

Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When it's time for joint displacement, command the patient that their muscle applies pressure on one thigh of its cushion (now known as a hernia), and you understand this is when dislocation occurs.
The restoration of all the limbs is to stretch out the groin tightly until it's possible over the cushion; attach your thighs to the face, pause the leg between the knees and apply pressure with your palms on the skin there, extending another servant beneath them for strength. Then extend their legs inside so that the intestine returns to its place by itself.
When it is necessary for his change (cushion) to be attached at the hip joint without labor,
And apply that and attach the cushion to their thighs, wrapping those with bandages for three or four days, applying them thusly.

The translation of the given phrase from medieval medical terminology into modern English would be: "At times the ankle is sprained by slight injury, and at other times it's dislocated either in its joints or deep within them. The dislocation occurs due to movements involving these parts." Here we see a description of how injuries might occur relative to different sections (joints) around the ankle area according to historical medical understanding:
And it is that when the ankle bends downwards towards where it has been separated, this constitutes its displacement (dislocation).
May the cure of his return be made easier and held within so that it may go back as intended.
When it comes to the treatment of him when he is dislocated according to supplementary measure, make sure you straighten his thigh and hold that limb firmly with a strong hand from behind where he sits at this place.

When hot waters are consumed as directed (accordingly), it means following a specific regimen or treatment plan, typically related to health and medicine in this context. The phrase implies that
Therefore, he applies the chest of the patient to the cushion gently as directed (accordingly), and you are at the lever or control mechanism (implied here could be referring metaphorically to your role in applying this treatment). The sentence indicates an action taken by a practitioner with precision under guidance
Thus if he returns the patient'dict to a gentle position after this treatment once or twice as directed (accordingly), and when times comes that his feet become swollen, indicate good results; otherwise, continue repeating the procedure until then return occurs, implying successful reduction of edema. This sentence underscores an iterative therapeutic process with attention to response signs such as foot engorgement or relief thereof through repeated treatments when necessary.
If you are forbidden from returning the patient's body to a position where they have been instructed (accordingly), then speak loud about their thigh on land twice, and first plant an ointment firm in earth that is locked by one leg; place between his legs this cloth or sheet so as not to let the humidity escape. Herein lies guidance for a situation where direct physical manipulation might be restricted due to specific circumstances – possibly related contractual obligations of caretakers, social etiquette within certain communities, cultural norms about privacy and exposure during medical treatment, or practical considerations like environmental conditions affecting the application of ointments. The instructions indicate an alternative approach whereby verbal guidance may suffice for leg elevation (possibly to manage fluid retention), while a cloth wraps around it – this ensures that absorption is retained within as
