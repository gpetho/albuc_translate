The third chapter on bone-setting.
This chapter is also one of the most important things needed in the practice of medicine, and it is the setting of fractures and dislocations that occur in the bones.
Know, my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never perused a book of the ancients on it, nor read a letter of it.
And for this reason, this art of science has become extinct in our country.
And I have never met anyone who is good at it at all.
But I benefited from it what I benefited because of my long reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.
Then I adhered to experience and practice throughout my life.
And I have depicted for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompassed and my experience has gone through, after I brought it closer to you and purified it from the branches of prolixity, and I summarized it to the utmost brevity and clarified it to the utmost clarity.
And I have depicted for you in it many images of the instruments that are used in it, as it is an increase in clarity, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
And there is no power except in Allah, the Most High, the Great.
