The clitoris may sometimes grow beyond its natural size until it becomes ugly and unpleasant in appearance. And it may grow large in some women until it spreads like that of men and becomes suitable for intercourse.	The clitoris may grow in size above the order of nature so that it gets a horrible deformed appearance; in some women it becomes erect like the male organ and attains to coitus.	0.8357302

As for the excess flesh, it is flesh that grows in the opening of the womb until it fills it. And it may protrude outward like a tail, and therefore some of the ancients call this disease 'the tail disease'. Therefore, you should cut it as you cut the clitoris and treat it until it heals.	As to the fleshy growth, that is, flesh growing in the cervix and filling it, and also often protruding like a tail (on which account some of the Ancients called it 'caudate disease'); this too you should cut away as you do for the clitoris, and dress until healed.	0.80057573
