When the humors overcome the bronchial tubes of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold complexion, then the patient must first be purged by laxative medicines; then cauterize him at the base of the throat, and be careful not to go down to the throat itself, and do not burn the heart but only a little.
Then make another cauterization at the joint of the neck at the top of the spine, and let the cautery be the one called "clavile," of which we have the form before; and treat the area as we have said before until it is healed.
