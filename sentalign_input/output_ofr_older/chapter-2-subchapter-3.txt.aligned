When a chronic migraine occurs, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of tears and heat in the temples and an old persistent headache and similar things, and it is treated by medical treatments and none of it helps, then we extract the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have explained.	When a man has a chronic migraine or acute catarrh, on account of acrid humidities and heat in the temporal muscles, or a violent chronic headache, or the like, and he has been treated with various medical treatments without success, we have sometimes in these diseases tried extraction of the arteries from the temples or cauterization of them, already described.	0.7492622
And the manner of their extraction is that the patient pulls back the hair of his temples, and feels for the artery that appears in the temple, for it appears well by its beating, and is slightly hidden except in some men who are very cold; and if it is hidden, then the patient tightens his neck with some cloths, then rubs the area with some rough cloth, and sprinkles the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula, which is of this form:	The manner of extraction is for the patient to shave the temporal hair; then you press upon the artery appearing on the temple; for it will be manifest to you by its pulsation, and is rarely invisible save in a few people or on account of severe cold. But if it is not plain to you then let the patient bind his neck with the end of his garment; then do you rub the place with a piece of cloth or foment with hot water, till the artery is obvious to you; then take a scalpel shaped thus; then with it gently scrape away the skin till you come to the artery, then stick a hook in it and draw it upward till you extract it from the skin and free it all round from the membranes that are beneath it.	0.843855
then lightly cut the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it up with pincers, and separate it well from the tissues that are beneath it on each side; and if the artery is thin, then turn it with the point of a hook, then cut it from that part according to the amount of the two heads. For if it is not cut, the blood does not spurt out completely.	But if it is not plain to you then let the patient bind his neck with the end of his garment; then do you rub the place with a piece of cloth or foment with hot water, till the artery is obvious to you; then take a scalpel shaped thus; then with it gently scrape away the skin till you come to the artery, then stick a hook in it and draw it upward till you extract it from the skin and free it all round from the membranes that are beneath it. But if the artery be thin, twist it with the tip of the hook and cut out enough of it for the two ends to be well separated from one another and contract so that no haemorrhage occurs; for if it is not divided and cut it will not let blood flow at all.	0.76690984
And draw out six cups of blood, up to three; and if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that no rot comes before the healing of the wound, and the flow of blood stops; then cut the excess that is between the two ties at that very hour, and then, if you want, cauterize it with a knife cautery to the bone until the heads are cut; and this is the best procedure, if the patient does not have a fever and he is of a hot complexion.	Then let blood, from six to three ounces. If the artery be large it should be ligated in two places with a strong double thread; the threads should be either silken or lute-string, lest corruption attack them before the wound is healed, and haemorrhage occur. Then cut away what remains between the two ligatures; do that immediately or later. If you wish, you may cauterize it down to the bone with an edged cautery so that the ends of the artery be divided; for this will replace that operation.	0.8493421
For the cautery helps to end the moisture: therefore it is of greater help for the moisture. Or, for the extraction of the arteries, one must fill the area with old cotton and place well-made tents on top; and when you untie them, treat them with dry medicines that make flesh grow, and with tents, until it is healed; and if blood runs from the artery while you are working, quickly stop it with cautery, or fill the area with vitriol and press it with your hand so that the blood stops; and if you do not have this on hand, place your finger on the spot until the blood clots, and sprinkle the area with cold water until the blood stops, and press as necessary; and the best and easiest method for extracting the artery is to cauterize the vein with a cutting cautery on both sides, but the cuts should be thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less. And there should be a finger's width of thickness between the two knives, and then when you have marked the two spots, place the burning iron on them until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and let there be a distance between the two heads because it is not entirely closed by this cautery; and this is the form of the cautery:	Less serious and easier than excising the artery is to cauterize the vessel with this cautery provided with two blades, having first marked both places with ink. Bring it down, very hot, till it reaches the bone and the artery is cut in two places, so as to put some distance between the two ends, for it will certainly not unite after this cauterization. This is the form of the cautery. It should have two sharp blades like two small paring-knives, but they should be much less sharp than a knife, for if they are as sharp as a knife they will quickly lose their heat and the flesh will be slow in cutting.	0.784202
