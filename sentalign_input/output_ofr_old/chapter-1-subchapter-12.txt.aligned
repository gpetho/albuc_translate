of the water of the eyes When water first comes to the eyes, by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that cleanses the head, and protect him from all moisture, and make him sweat in a bath several times while fasting.	On cautery in cataract of the eye. When by those signs I have mentioned in the relevant section there is brought to your notice the beginning of a cataract of the eye, start with draughts for the patient such as shall cleanse his head; and guard him from all humidities. Make him also sweat for some days, fasting, in the bath.	0.75529826
Afterward, have him shave the back of his head, and make a cautery in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the flow of water is in both eyes, or one if the flow is in one; and with the cautery burn all the veins and arteries that are below the heart, and let the cauteries be long according to the width of the temple; and beware of excessive bleeding, and if you see too much blood coming out, staunch it with such power as you have.	Make him also sweat for some days, fasting, in the bath. Then tell him to have his head shaved; and burn him with one cauterization in the middle of the head; then cauterize him with two burns on the temples if the cataract is beginning in both eyes; or on the one side only if it is in one eye. And with the cautery cut all the subcutaneous veins and arteries; and let the cauterizations be long, across the breadth of the temples. Beware of haemorrhage; if you see any, stanch it straight away with any means you can.	0.85966337
