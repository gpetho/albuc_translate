Of the civil vein
This vein occurs in the legs, in hot areas where no grass or trees grow, and in land where there is no moisture;
and it sometimes appears elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens due to decay that comes under the skin,
just as snakes and worms come within the body, generated between skin and flesh.
And the signs of the beginning of this vein are that it comes in the leg with a very great inflammation,
then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like a root of a plant.
When the head appears, it is necessary to wrap around a piece of lead of one and a half З to two З, and tie it,
and let the lead hang on the leg, and every time a point comes out, wrap it around the lead, and tie it;
and if it is too long, cut a part, and wrap the rest, and do not cut it at the root, until it is all out;
because if you cut it, it reenters the flesh, and causes an abscess and decay in the place, and bad disease;
for which reason it is necessary that it be drawn little by little to the end, and nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when drawn out, is five palms long, or ten,
and a man once came to me, whose vein was ten palms long, and when you cut it, put a hook in the opening, and pierce it to the bottom,
so that it all comes out; and let the matter inside be emptied, and administer medicines generating decay for a few days, then treat it as abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or on the foot,
and many openings appear, from which branches come out; treat it then as we have said before.
