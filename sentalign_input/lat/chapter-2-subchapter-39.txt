On the extraction of a leech.
Chapter 39.
When a leech is treated with what I mentioned in the section on medicinal treatments and it does not work, then examine the patient's throat in the sunlight, either directly or by sunlight, after pressing his tongue with the instrument I told you about.
If your sight then falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook or carefully with fine forceps.
If it is not possible with those, then take a hollow tube, insert it into the patientâ€™s throat near the throat, then insert heated iron with fire into the hollow of the tube.
Do this repeatedly, and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day.
Then let him take a glass full of cold water, open his mouth in it, rinse his mouth with it without swallowing any, and move the water with his hand every hour.
For the leech will immediately fall when it senses the water.
If it still does not come out with what we have mentioned, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs or with asa using the instrument I described for fumigating the uvula.
Do this repeatedly, for it will fall.
The method for fumigation is to take a pot containing live coals with fire; let the pot be covered with a lid that has a hole in its center, and place the end of the instrument in that hole.
Then, let the fumigation enter, and let the patient place his mouth on the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
For the leech will immediately fall.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the patient endure thirst, eat salty food and garlic, and not drink water.
It is thus necessary that it be expelled with this treatment.
And this is the shape of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it comes into view.
It is similar to forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve, which is inserted into the throat.
And its end is like the beak of the bird called a stork, with a roughness like a file; when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
