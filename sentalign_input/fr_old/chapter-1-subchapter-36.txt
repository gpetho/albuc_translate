of a poorly healed wound
When the patient cannot endure cutting or opening, as we will recount in its place, then comes such a disease that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula forms and becomes old, discharging pus and corrupted moisture, probe it with a thin tent, and ensure you know the depth with the tent. Afterward, heat the cautery resembling a razor, and place it in the fistula according to the depth the tent reached, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupted flesh is burned, once, twice, or three times, as needed; and beware of burning the nerves and large veins. If the fistula goes to the bladder or intestines, avoid these areas, and only do this in fleshy areas, ensuring it does not perforate; afterward treat the area until healed, and if the area is sealed and the matter removed for a long time, then know the area is entirely healed; if not, know the area is troubled, and the bone is corrupted at the base; and like one of these that we will mention in its place.
