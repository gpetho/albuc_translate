of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When the hemorrhoids are in the anus, one or more, and are old and are from gross cold and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we have said in divisions, and it is not effective, then make cauteries: three on the spine, the one that is furthest out below the shoulder blade little by little in a triangle, and one cautery below the navel two fingers; and if you think that their stomach is chilled, and the food is not digested, and one sees swelling in the face, then make a large cautery on the stomach, as mentioned before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the key-shaped cautery; and leave the cautery open for a long time.
After, treat the area until it is healed.
