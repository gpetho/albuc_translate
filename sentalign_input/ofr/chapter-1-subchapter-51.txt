Regarding swelling that cannot mature/come to a head
When someone has a condition called "adubelati," and it is slow to mature or come to a head, either because of excess matter it produces or the age of the patient when he is decrepit (that is to say, very old) and he has little blood, or because of the weather; and you wish to hasten its maturation: then cauterize around it with many small cauteries, pricking; afterwards leave it alone.
For it will hasten to mature/come to a head.
And if you want to pierce it completely with the cautery, then heat the cautery which has this shape:
And place your hand in the middle of this condition called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it on the outside in such a way that the flow of pus is facilitated. 
Afterwards treat it until it is completely healed.
