If the beginning of the descending water in the eye is clear to you by the signs that were mentioned in the classification, then hasten to give the sick person what purifies his head, and protect him from all moistures, and make him sweat in the bath on an empty stomach for days.	When by those signs I have mentioned in the relevant section there is brought to your notice the beginning of a cataract of the eye, start with draughts for the patient such as shall cleanse his head; and guard him from all humidities. Make him also sweat for some days, fasting, in the bath.	0.79381335
Then order him to shave his head and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head. Then cauterize him with two cauteries on the temples if the beginning of the descent of the water is in both eyes, or from one side if it is in one eye.	Then tell him to have his head shaved; and burn him with one cauterization in the middle of the head; then cauterize him with two burns on the temples if the cataract is beginning in both eyes; or on the one side only if it is in one eye.	0.8955943
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin, and let the cauteries be long across the width of the temples, and beware of bleeding, so if you see any of it, stop it immediately with any treatment you can, and we will come to the wisdom in stripping the arteries and cutting them and guarding against bleeding.	And with the cautery cut all the subcutaneous veins and arteries; and let the cauterizations be long, across the breadth of the temples. Beware of haemorrhage; if you see any, stanch it straight away with any means you can. We shall deal later on with the method of extraction and cutting out of arteries, and provision against haemorrhage.	0.8472731
And he may be cauterized on the nape of the neck under the two bones with two deep cauteries.	Two strong cauterizations are sometimes made on the back of the neck below the two bones.	0.61533415
