of hemorrhoids
Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood commonly flows, and when hemorrhoids are old, they become thelul; we have already described their appearances and signs in the division, and I will now explain those that receive treatment. I say that hemorrhoids and thelul, when they are deep in the womb and cannot be felt, are not treated with surgery. Those at the mouth of the womb, which can be felt, can be treated. The woman should be placed in a cold room, then extend the thelul with forceps, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle hemostatic medicines like acacia, dragonâ€™s blood, frankincense, and similar substances; then place her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water; and if there is bleeding, make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peel, galls, and similar things, then take barley flour, mix it with honey and egg white, and make a poultice for her back. If this stops the bleeding, it is good. If not, make her sit with cupping glasses on her back and breasts without cutting; then take wool, moisten it in plantain juice or dog rose juice with old wine, and apply it to the spot. When the abscess subsides, treat the place with ointment until it is healed; the condition called "albathir" is red and resembles a rough head, it must be cut as I described for the thelul; then treat it until it is healed.
