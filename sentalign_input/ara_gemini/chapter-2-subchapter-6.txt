The sixth chapter on the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone or something like stone, such as iron and glass; or a plant seed, such as chickpeas and kernels, and so on; or a flowing thing, such as water and vinegar, and so on; or an animal.
When a pebble or something like a pebble, which does not grow in the ear, falls into the ear, face the ear towards the sun. If you see the pebble, drop in it a bit of violet oil or candle wax, then try to remove it by moving the head or by sneezing with hellebore, blocking the nostrils when the sneeze comes, after placing a ring of rags or wool around the ear and pulling the ear upwards; often it comes out with this treatment.
If it doesn't come out, then try to remove it with the gentle instrument which is pictured here:
If it comes out with the husk, fine, otherwise try to extract it with a smooth, blunt hook with little curvature.
If it doesn't come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube gently into the ear hole.
And seal around the tube with pitch softened with oil so that the air has no path except through the tube.
Then suck it out with your breath strongly and often it comes out with this.
If it doesn't come out with what we described, then take a small amount of gum arabic or processed gum, which is used for catching birds.
Place it at the tip of the probe after wrapping tightly around it some cotton.
Then insert it gently into the ear hole after drying the ear from moisture.
If it doesn't come out with all that we described, then proceed to incision before a hot swelling occurs or it becomes tense.
The method of incision is to first phlebotomize the patient in the cephalic vein and draw blood according to his strength.
Then sit the patient before you and turn his ear upwards and make a small incision at the base of the ear near its lobe in the lower part of it.
And the incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone.
Then extract it with whatever instruments you can.
Then stitch the incision immediately quickly and treat it until it heals.
But if the thing that has fallen into the ear is one of the grains that swell and expand, try to extract it with what we mentioned.
If it doesn't come out, then take a thin, delicate scalpel like this:
And try with it to break up that type of grain fallen in the ear.
And you only do that if you are certain that that grain has been moistened by the earâ€™s vapor until it becomes many small pieces.
Then you extract it with the blind hook, or with soft date fibers, or by sucking, as we mentioned.
For that makes its extraction easy.
As for water that has entered the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with hellebore.
And he should have filled his ear with some worn cotton while lying down on that ear in which the water is.
If it comes out with that, fine; otherwise, take many pebbles the length of fingers, thin and smooth.
Warm them a little with fire.
And the patient inserts one of them into the opening of his ear.
And he hops on one foot on that side.
And he hits another stone against the stone that is in the ear.
He continues doing that with pebble after pebble until all the water comes out.
The water may also come out by taking one papyrus reed or feather.
And insert one end of it into the ear.
And set fire to the other end until most of it burns.
Then repeat with another feather, doing this several times until all the water comes out.
Or you can draw it out with the tube in the way that was described with the pebble.
As for removing an animal that has entered the ear, observe: if it is small-bodied like a flea or similar, treat it with what I mentioned in the section.
But if its body is large, perceptible to the senses, try to extract it with date fibers and hooks.
Its case is easier than anything that gets stuck in the ear.
As for removing worms that have developed in the ear, if you treated it with what we mentioned in the section on ear drops and your treatment was not successful,
then you should look into the ear in the sun, and if any worms appear to you, extract them with date fibers or soft hooks.
If none appear to you, then take a tube; this is its form:
Narrow at the bottom and wide at the top.
And insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can bear.
Then suck with it strongly.
Do this repeatedly until all the worms come out.
If it doesn't come out, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned to you regarding the stone.
If it doesn't come out with what we mentioned, use the ear drops that I mentioned.
The ancients have tried it in killing worms.
And you will find that in the article on ear drops.
And your pouring of oils and medicines into the ear will be with this instrument.
And this is its picture:
As you see, you make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom, with a small hole in it, and wide at the top.
And if you wish, the nozzle that is inside the tube can be made of well-wrought copper.
And if you wish, you take a probe and wrap cotton around its end tightly, then you put the oil or juice or whatever you want of these medications into the tube while it is in the ear, then you insert the probe with the cotton from above and squeeze it with your hand with a moderate squeeze until the oil is pushed into the ear canal and the patient feels it entering.
And let what you pour into the ear be slightly warmed by the fire.
And beware that the thing that is instilled in it not be very cold or very hot, because the ear cannot tolerate that.
