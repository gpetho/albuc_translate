Chapter Twenty-Two on the Treatment of Broken Bones if They Are Set Crooked
And its action was prevented as it should be.
So when a limb that has been set after its healing exhibits a curvature or a protrusion of the broken bone, or a knotting, and the appearance of the limb is thus disfigured, but the limb is not prevented from its natural function.
Then it is not appropriate to accept the statement of someone who claims to break the limb again, although many of the ignorant physicians and bone-setters do that in our country, and this action is very reprehensible, leading to great harm, the least of which is damage.
But if the curvature and knotting are soft, then it should be fomented with water in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and its root, and melilot, and so on, and it should be dressed with softening dressings such as well-made diachylon.
Or marshmallow root mucilage should be taken and mixed with chicken fat and sesame oil, and it should be dressed with it.
Or fatty figs should be taken and pounded with pigeon dung, and similar medications that are called dissolvers of healing.
And the knotting may be dissolved by constant gentle massage done with the hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all times.
But if the curvature is old and severe and hardened, and necessity calls for its treatment with iron, then it should be incised at its top and the connection of the bone should be released, and the excess of knotting or bone should be cut with gentle cuts, and gentleness should be employed in this with effort and care.
Then the wound should be treated with what has been mentioned previously until it heals.
