Of castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book; and it is only necessary for two reasons: one is so that the doctor knows how to respond when asked about it, and knows the treatment; the other is because we often need to castrate certain animals to help us, such as goats, sheep, cats, and other animals. I say then that castration is done in two ways: by extraction or by cutting. In the method of extraction, we make the animal sit in hot water until the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand until they are relaxed and you cannot feel them anymore. For cutting castration: hold the animal, press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut each egg with one cut, after properly peeling them; leave some syfac and the fine syfac on the vessels; and this method of castration is better than the extraction method, because with extraction sometimes some of the testicles remain, causing the animal to still desire to mate; then treat the wound until it is healed.
