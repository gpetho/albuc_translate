When an abscess forms in the root of the uvula, palate, or tooth roots, and it breaks and becomes chronic, forming a fistula, and your treatment is ineffective, it is necessary to use a cautery. Heat the cautery to fit the fistula and insert it into the fistula, holding it until the hot iron reaches the base; repeat this once or twice if needed, and then treat it as previously described until it heals.	When there comes a tumour in the base of the gums or in the palate or in the roots of the molar teeth, and it becomes purulent and breaks out and a fistula comes from the flow of pus, and you have treated this without effect, you should heat a cautery of a size to fit the fistula; then introduce it hot into the fistula opening; and continue the pressure with it hot until the iron, still hot, reaches the hollow and the extremity of it. Do this once or twice over. Then afterwards treat as we have mentioned until it heals.	0.8874495
If the pus is removed and it heals, that is good; if not, it is necessary to expose the area and remove the decayed bone as described in the relevant chapter.	If the matter stops and it heals, well and good; otherwise it is impossible to avoid opening up the place and removing the diseased bone in the manner we shall speak of in its proper chapter.	0.7829075
