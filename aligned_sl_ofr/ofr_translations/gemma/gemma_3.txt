O ye, most dear sons, I have completed this book which is the end of the science of medicine, embracing its applications and terminating with its demonstrations and pronouncements. And it has come to my notice that I should accompany this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, namely surgery
And because the work of hands is rare in our region and is strange to all, if it is omitted from the science and left out, only the small descriptions of the ancients remain in books that the hands have done. And from this comes the error and the emptiness, and the closures of the understandings and the displacement of the science.
Or me semble que je la vuel vivifier ensamble l’ordination de cest traitier selonc la voie d’exposition et de declaration et de l’abreviation; et venrai ensamble les formes des ferremens de cautere, et des autres estrumens de l’uevre avec l’ajostement de la declaration et de preparation de li, sicom il est mestier.
Or I seem to recall that I may restore life together with the arrangement of this physician according to the mode of exposure and declaration and abbreviation; and I shall bring together the forms of the instruments of cautery, and the other instruments of the work with the arrangement of the declaration and preparation of it, as is proper And it is proper that he who interferes should learn in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, as long as he grasps the judgment of members, and the forms and the joints and the separations of these, and knows the bones and nerves and limbs and the number of bones, and the movement of veins and the resting of them.
And thus Hippocrates teaches us that one must not fear the unknown, for with work comes reward; and the same in the art of healing.
We must say at the outset of this book that whoever is not acquainted with the things to be learned is often led astray by fear and scorns the homes; just as I have often seen more of these things which are interwoven with this science than those which depart from it and from sense.
For I have seen a foolish man who, when he has opened an abscess or the head of a woman, has so bled that the woman died between his hands.
And thus there is another case which treats a stone of a bladder of a pig, and the stone was great; it carried away with it a piece of the bladder, and remained in the hon [bladder] for two days.
I have already been called to treat this case, and I saw the condition of the patient and the greatness of the stone, and indeed if it were to be pulled out, it would surely kill him.</start_of_turn>
And thus there is another case which treats a duke from our land who had a broken limb, and with the bandage it caused a wound; and the physicians of this place constrain the fracture above the wound as these stars are by strong ligament, and do not allow any blood to come out, and leave it thus until the limb is whole; and they command that it not be moved; and when the limb is whole and the piece is gone, it is lost forever.</start_of_turn>
I am ordered to come to him, and I hasten to come to loosen the limb; and when I see it dislocated, it is without pain and without feeling any discomfort.
But every way the corruption is already confirmed or the limb is unsound, and I cannot heal it; and it continues to displace until the limb is entirely lost
And thus another sign which makes the swelling worse is that it bites and stings, and then becomes inflamed by the malice of its lord.
For a wound that is infected with melancholic humours, I do not know that it can be cured except by touching it with fire so long as anything corrupted can be removed from it.
And thus, know well, that the work of the hands has become divided into thirteen parts: that is to say, there is peril in many things; and I shall show in each chapter where there is doubt and peril.
Therefore, you must be wary, for if the fools speak badly of you, they will do you no good.</start_of_turn>
If you take up your weapons carelessly, and undertake your diseases lightly and firmly, and use the better way if by the grace of God you come to health and peace; and leave the contagious diseases of grief far behind; and stay away from those things which make you doubt, and take comfort in what you can.
Galiens dist en aucuns de ses amonestemens: «Ne prenez mie en cure male maladie, que vos ne soiez apelez fol mire.»
Foreigners depart in boats of their warnings: “Do not take my advice badly for a disease, for you are called foolish like me.”
The first chapter deals with fire cautery and medicine, and the chapter orders from the head down; and forms of instruments, and instruments of cautery, and everything necessary for the work
The second chapter deals with amputation and incision, and abscesses and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and cutting into stones, and similar things; and the chapter orders and the forms of instruments.
The third chapter deals with restoring dislocations and fractures, and similar matters; and it orders the lord chief justice to bring the instruments.
Just as we recalled from the work, it is proper to say the quality of the aid and the gentleness of complexion
I say that the quality of the aid and the gentleness are the longest words and the most subtle science and the greatest secret; and about this there are many sayings, and they agree on this; and I am silent about their words, because I fear their length.
I say that the fire cautery helps universally for any complexion or matter, because there are two complexions: that is to say a complexion hot in matter, and a complexion dry in matter.
In complexion chaude et seche, mixed with matter, some say that cautery is a great aid; others say that cautery is of no avail for disease except when it comes from heat and dryness.
For indeed the nature of fire is hot, and should not be a cure for fiery diseases by heat, nor from dryness; thus those who say the opposite that cautery does great aid to fiery and dry diseases that arise from the humors of the body For when you compare the body and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have never found it to be otherwise by experience
And every way, no fire has come between me and fury except that which has experienced it, and which knows by long experience the chapter of cauteries, and the diversity of the complexion of men, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the issues and the space of their pains; for other temperaments we have no fear, even in cold and moist diseases. And all of them are settled and agree with the cautery.
And know this, child, that cautery with fire is more effective for secret healing than burning cautery.
For fire is simple, and comes only from the member that is being cauterized, and does no harm to any other member except its name.
Burning medicines come from one member to another, causing grief and bringing diseases to the member; and by chance often causes harm to the patient.
Fire, because of its height and the goodness of its substance, does not make this worse, if there is no excess.
And this I have learned through experience and the length of my service and study in this art, and it is based on truth; and for this reason I apologize for the length of my words, for it does not please me to hide the secret which is returned or fire, and the quality of this work, as it demonstrates the healing of diseases of the body, as the philosopher demonstrates; or you may consider it in your thoughts.
Know this, son, that it is necessary to apply the cautery at the proper tension and without haste.</start_of_turn>
I say that the cautery is useful in all tensions, for the harmful effects that result from it are driven away by the action of the cautery; and even though the cautery is for necessary pains that are violent and urgent, which cannot await the tension of a greater harm to the limb.</start_of_turn>
And think not, dear son, if like madmen they make; for the disease which is cured by cautery has no return; and he says thus; but it is not so easy, for cautery is but a medicine which moves the complexion, and dries up the humors which are the cause of the pain, and is worth more than medicine for its haste of value, and for the excellence of its work and its lordship.
And indeed, it is known that the disease does not come once according to the complexion of the patient and the cause of the disease and its virtue; and are assembled in him the superfluities by the acquisition of food and other things, if these cauteries are administered in place or if there is little excess of superfluity and moisture, as with dense cautery for pain, and other things, and part of the pain does not return again; but this is often the case.</start_of_turn>
And many people do not understand that cautery is not called medicine, and it is seen; but they do not believe that cautery is worth more than medicine, but their understanding is false, and it is cautery that is behind medicine because whenever we administer remedies for any disease and they do not work, we then administer the cautery, and it is worth more.</start_of_turn> Therefore although cautery is at the back of medicine, it does not go against the intention of wise men.
The ancients say that gold cautery is more subtle than iron, and they do not say that fire is better, but only by the quality of the gold and its fineness; and they say that the leaves of gold do not burn, but this is not true, for I have seen it happen in many people; and gold cautery is worth as much as iron, as they say.</start_of_turn>
And indeed when you burn the instrument of gold, you do not know how much it is charred by the color of the gold, and when it has cooled; and if you burn it too much, it will be charred by the fire; and there will be enough hindrance.</start_of_turn>
And for this reason we use our fire cautery, as we have often observed in our work.
Or you have ordered this chapter from the head down to the feet, because in this way it is easier to see it
the olive cautery.
These cauteries are useful for moisture and cold on the brain, and there are two things that cause them: a disease called “soda,” and many humors that descend from the head causing swelling of the eyes, ears, and the like.  There are also many dreams and pains of the teeth and throat, and even many diseases that come from the cold, such as paralysis, soda, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
The form of this cautery is that the patient be purged with a medicinal solution modifying the head, either twice or thrice, according to what is useful and agreeable and accustomed to the patient; and then repeat the head of the patient.
And then make him sit comfortably between your hands, and put his hands under his belly; after that put the root of your thumb on the root of his elbow between his two fingers; and there or will come your two means, if it bleeds from the inside then evacuate the cautery which is called "olive", for this is the form:
And take out the sign of ink, and make descending and extracting your hand back and forth; then keep your hand steadily, and renew the cautery until you see the bone somewhat; and if you do not see it, continue the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you; after that take up one-tenth of a spoonful of aloe, and put it on and cover with cotton wool, and take out the wound, and leave it for two days; after that put on a soft dressing.
And the elders say, the more time the wound is left open, the more it purges; and for this reason it is useful to apply pressure.
And the elders say, one must not leave the burn cautery on for too long, lest part of the bone should burn; then one must rese that which is around the bone, and it must be healed.</start_of_turn>
And the elders say, one must not leave the burn cautery on for too long, lest part of the bone should burn; then one must rese that which is around the bone, and it must be healed.  One must also keep the wound open for a long time; after this it must be cured and dressed.</start_of_turn
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be of any benefit in all bones, except in certain homes or where there is doubt; and I believe that I must leave it alone; for the head of the shoulder is easily damaged by continuous solutions of nature, as we have witnessed in other limbs; and even when the patient’s condition is feeble by nature, the first semblance of cautery is more effective and gentler for me, and for this reason I will abstain from it.</start_of_turn
From the ancient pain of the head.
When throughout the head there is chronic pain that lasts a long time, the patient must be given rest and drugs that are called «cochie», and vomiting of the head and oil and poultices; and if we make the cautery as we have said before, it is of no use.</start_of_turn>
Take care that if the patient’s ailment is of great nature, and that it is not too painful; then the cautery should be made as we have said previously.</start_of_turn
After having made the cautery on the bone of the head as we have said, and having made the cautery of the vein which is called the «vasselz», which is under the skin where we put the sponges; keep your hand still so that you do not see blood until you reach the bone: the patient feels much more pain in this cautery than in others, and I will speak of it later; and it is better that the cautery be made on the corners than on the middle of the head, for this is the form:
Dou cautere dou chief. When in a part of the shoulder there is sudden pain, and the disease is prolonged, and the head of the shoulder is expelled by means of medicines, and other treatments have been made as I have said in the division of diseases, and all this has availed nothing: then make cautery as I have said before, namely by means of medicine and fire.
The cautery of medicine is like this: if you take a dose of alum, and burn the skin and cover it. If there are two bones, then do the temple or the place where the pain remains in order to be able to reattach the dose of alum to the skin; and when it is reattached, if you bind and constrain it well and leave it for .xij. hours; and then take it off and treat the wound for .ij. days or .iij.; and put on a bandage as before until the swelling subsides.
After the cure of inflammation while it is still sound; and if you see that you must do something of these remedies that I have written or dose to treat these remedies.
The iron cautery is as follows: Shape it like this.</start_of_turn>
And it is called "closed" because its head is made in the shape of a hook or with a slight curve, and in the middle there is a small projection; grasp the painful area and hold your hand firmly, until half of the thickness of the hair is burned; and keep your hand steady so that the artery does not burn, which is dangerous, and discharge abundance of blood.</start_of_turn>
After putting on cotton wool around the area, take out the limb by two days; then put on moist cotton wool again, and finally cure the limb of inflammation until it is sound; and if you cauterize this hernia with the cautery which is called "cultellare", at the point, and keep it covered over the artery in this hernia which is not ancient.
De Emigraine.
When the armpit is cauterized as we have previously mentioned in the discussion of diseases, and it does not yield, and you see that the burn precedes the medicine and does not suffice, then it is necessary to abandon the cautery which is called the "knife" while it is still soft; and sign the limb with a line half an inch long, and hold the hand once, and strain that you do not cover the artery and that life does not depart until the bone; and be careful of the jaw that is mute when you move it, and that the blood does not clot except for the spasm and tension that arise from the disease; and be careful of excessive bleeding from the artery when it is cauterized, or from the cautery itself which often causes great pain and even to those who are unskilled and inexperienced. And leave the work in peace; but I will tell you later how to retain the blood when the artery is cauterized, and I will show you where it is written in this book.
And if you see that this cautery does not suffice for the disease, and the patient is suffering, cauterize the area around the chief as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed; and if you see that this is not enough, administer the cautery that we have mentioned or the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has three needles. This latter cautery is better and more effective than the former
From the cold of the ears to the part of the head.
When pain arises from cold in the ears, and we have applied various medicines and other cures as mentioned earlier, and the pain persists, then withdraw this cautery which is called "poins," for this is its form:
After having cauterized around the painful ear, or around the root of the ear if the pain persists, grasp the earlobe from the root and pull it outwards until the bleeding stops; and there should be ten cauteries around the ear; then cure the wound when it is healed.
From the torture of the mouth.
Torture that must be cured by cautery is not fierce except for those that move from phlegm, as we have said in the division of diseases; and do not make any cautery that resembles that which comes from drying and swelling of nerves.
When you cure this semblance of torture that moves from hydropic swelling and vomiting of the head and hiccuping, and this is not worth it, then you must cauterize the patient with two cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and the other a little below the temple, and the third between the two eyebrows; and put the cautery on the part that is open without causing excessive damage, and cauterize the area under the chief of the ear below a little of the cartilage of the ear, and another at the temple as long as a bean; and leave the cautery on for as long as half of the current is burned; this is the form of the cautery.
And this is the semblance of the burn that we put before you, but it is a more subtle and effective cautery than the knife, because it is a deeper incision; after curing like this as I have said, as long as it is sound.
When apoplexia is ancient and you cure it as we have said, and it does not profit, and the patient does not have a fever, then you make three cauteries: two on the two corners of the head, one in the middle of the head, and one where it is called "vasselz" as we have previously said; and the last cauterization is on the mouth of the stomach; and it is cured as we have previously said.

When this disease is present, it is necessary to give the patient large doses of urine and medicinal pills that modify the brain; after that, raise the head of the patient all the way up, and put on the occiput the plaster of sinapis which is written or treat with poultices; and this is the manner of cautery: as I have said.
If he is sane at the start, it is well; and if he is not, two cauteries must be made upon the head, descending to the collar, and there must be space between each cautery of one hand's breadth; and the cure must be as with the others. And if you see that the patient is suffering, and the patient is fainting, make one cautery in the middle; and if the patient is in pain, make two further on the two horns, and cure until he is sane. And let the cautery which is called "olive" be as I have said before.

And let the cautery which is called "olive" be as I have said before. For from the cold of the head... It is necessary that the head be made limp with herbs and what we have said before; after which the head of the patient is to be raised, and then make the cautery upon the head and upon some horn, and one behind and two upon the spine of the collar; and if there is more need, and the limb is moist and the patient is fainting, and the disease is strong, make three cauteries upon the spine of the back; and leave it until more than four fingers are gone, and hold your hand; after which cure until he is sane, and let the cautery which is called "olive" be as we have said before.
Of epilepsy.
Epileptics must not use fire cautery except when the patient is feverish; and it is first necessary to modify the brain by herbs and other cures that we have mentioned in the preceding chapter when the patient is great and suffering from great pain requiring medical attention.</start_of_turn>
And if it is a young child who cannot endure suffering, make him gargle and chew modifying the brain often with bones of meat; then take the head and make a wound in the middle, and make .i. cautery as we have said before, and .i. cautery on the vein and on the spleen; and if the patient is strong and suffering, make cauteries as we have said to those who have paralysis and softening of bones, on the spine of the back and neck, or let the olive cautery proceed as we have said.</start_of_turn
If the patient is a child, make .i. cautery superficially as follows:
When melancholy is the cause, superficial humours or corrupted moisture and large phlegm, then we must cauterize with some of the cauteries as we have said for those who have paralysis.
And when melancholy is the cause, if the superficial humour is declining towards melancholy and the patient is moist with moisture, then we must give him something to drink to moisten the brain, as is seen in the division
After that, take the patient’s head; then make a circle of lint about the head well-made, as for a circle; put it on the patient’s head; the patient should lie crosswise, and be well held from all sides; then bring the circle over the head and put on a bandage of elderberry juice; and burn the fire moderately, so that it should not be able to cause him pain; after that, empty the circle from the head and let it cool; do this to the patient once every week with another good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you see cauterize the hair in making many pricks throughout the burn. This manner of cautery soothes the brain somewhat; then put on moist cotton wool in the burn and grease with geline.
Or if you see the hair cauterized in making many pricks throughout the burn. This manner of cautery somewhat soothes the brain; then put on moist cotton wool in the burn and grease with gelline. When awe comes first, as signs that I have said in the division, then begin and do give the patient something to drink which will temper the head, and guard against all moisture, and cause him to sweat or bathe several times on an empty stomach.
After you have commanded him to rest his head, and you have cauterized the head, and you have made three cauteries on the two temples if the head has descended from the awe, or two if it has descended only slightly; and you should cauterize all the veins and arteries that are below the shoulder, and make the cauteries long according to the width of the temple; and guard against excessive bleeding, and if you see too much blood issuing, if there is a danger of infection as you have.
And I shall teach you concerning the extraction of arteries and the incision of the cautery how you shall extend it; and in no way shall you make the cautery or cautery oil touch the marrow of the last three bones behind.
And I shall teach you concerning the extraction of arteries and the incision of the cautery how you shall extend it; and in no way shall you make the cautery or cautery oil touch the marrow of the last three bones behind.
When the tears of the eyes are old and accustomed and are on the veins, or if you cut the arteries that are in appearance like wounds of the chief of the forhead; and you see that these are cold fleumatic superfluities, then you must make the cautery as I said at the beginning of this section: that is, cauterize the chief and two cauteries on the two temples and two cauteries or cautery oil on the marrow of the three bones; and if necessary, if there is swelling below the eye, make a small cautery there.
Pain au corps des larmes par dedens les yeux.
When you have treated the patient as we have said in the previous division, and it does not help, then give the patient two drinks of wine; after that, raise the head and do cautery or a mild cautery of olive oil; and make three cauteries of the cautery which is called "claw" on the three nipples, two below the armpits; and be careful not to touch the artery that you are working on.</start_of_turn> This is the form of the cautery which is called "claw":</start_of_turn
When the marrow of the oil is softened by disease and moisture, then the cautery of this cautery which is called "olive" is made. Thus is the form:
And if you see that you must perform two cauteries on the two nipples which are as long as the nipples are; do not hold the hand but until the third part of the areola has been burned, as I have said.
And if you see that you must perform two cauteries on the two nipples which are as long as the nipples are; do not hold the hand but until the third part of the areola has been burned, as I have said. Never have I seen that the hair of the oil has been converted into ointment, and pricks the oil, and makes cauteries in two ways: that is to say of fire, or burning medicine.
Ou cautere de feu comande au malaide qu’il laisse les poilz tant qu’il soient lons et igals; et s’il le poignent a lor nassance, se li estraint les eulz qu’il ne se muevent tant qu’il naissent.
When they grow and are even, then command the patient to keep the hair long; afterwards mark on the edge of the hair a figure as big as a mustard seed or the beginning of a bristle; then put a moist cloth on the oil and a little ointment on the hair, and cover the cautery as follows:
After cautering at the mark that you have made, and doing this several times, until the hair curls up to the root; and the sign of the work is that the hair retreats from the oil, and the hair stands up at the root; then hold your hand there, and leave it for two days; then put a moist cloth on the wound until the scab has hardened; afterwards cure the wound until it is healed.
If after this the hair comes away, and the papere is softened, then renew the fire on this same place as you did before; and if the hair is burnt, burn the papere until it returns to its natural state, and is even, and do not prick the hair with the oil.
The burning cautery of medicine is that you command the patient to let the hair grow large and even, then make a parchment like the shape of the laurel leaf; then take French soap and live salt, each a third, and grind them together well; and make it boil rapidly, if it does not freeze, then apply it upon the shape that you have made like the laurel leaf, and put on the papere eggs; and if the patient holds in one oil only, if you must open in one, and if in both; and put on the cotton oil soaked in egg white. And let the patient's arm be steady and put your hand showing on the medicine, and press it once and let it move every time the patient feels a biting of the medicine, for he feels a biting like of fire. When you have done this for a while, if the medicine has reached your hand. When the bite has passed, if you lift the limb up, and you see the wound rise just as if it had been raised by the contraction of fire or by incision; and if it is firm, it is well. If not, if you repeat the treatment on the limb or the treatment has not been effective, until your works are even and your wounds are at a point; then put on a moist compress over the wound until the sparks have ceased, and then cure the wound which is called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
If you have taken great care of your work and there is no need for further medicine, and the wound becomes soft after the bite, and the hair is pricked with oil; then repeat the treatment on the limb which is softened by the oil, as you did before; then cure until it is healed. This is the form of a wound that has been treated with oil.
Know that the spirits of men are diverse in greatness and smallness, and according to this be their constraints; and do not be afraid to reply to him in the right way to him who studies this art.
Of the healing of fistula by cautery
When you cure fistula as we have said in the division of diseases, and your cure does not help, then you must cauterize according to this manner.
Instruct the patient to hold their head still; and grasp their hair between your hands in a firm manner so that it does not move; after that, put a cotton swab moistened with oil or vinegar on the wound; then heat the cautery which is partly burnt: and hold it to the hair if it forms like a pine cone; gather the hair that it is burnt; if you see that some hair is pulled out from one root to the other, and if you see that there is as much as with a try; but in any case, this is worth more than your work.
After pressing the fistula until it is over, and draining the pus, and drying; and if it is closed, if the wound has healed, and drain the pus; then put the cautery on the wound, and hold your hand over the cautery at the part where there is no oil, so that your hands do not make a mess; and put the cautery in the fat of the oil, and compress it.
If you begin the cautery from the outset until the bone, that would be well. If this does not suffice, restart the cautery once more; if you are in doubt, leave it for two days. Then place a moist cotton swab in the wound and treat the desiccation until it is healed. If twenty days pass and it is still not healed, apply a corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and follow the advice of your physician.
There is a method of cautery for fistula that none of the ancients have mentioned. When there is a fistula, open the wound; then insert one inch of soft sponge into the opening in the following form: And one makes for the quantity of a third of a pound; and keep your hand or sponge firmly closed, and do not move the patient in any way, except the melted sponge comes out by itself; and it is necessary to put on the patient a moist cotton swab in the place of oil, wool or awl: the sponge if it is like that will come out from the fistula itself and will leave the remainder perfectly preserved and whole.
If the fistula is cured by the cautery as we have said, that is good. But if this does not suffice, if it is necessary, it is permitted to perform a perforation on the nerve and bring the fistula back to its original place as it should be in its proper place.

When you have treated these fractures as we have said in the sections, and the cure does not help, then you should perform a small burn cautery as follows:
When you have treated these fractures as we have said in the sections, and the cure does not help, then you should perform a small burn cautery as follows:
from the armpit of the arm</start_of_turn
When the armpit of the arm or the elbow or the shoulder or the root of the tooth comes loose, after making a perforation and rounding it off and it becomes swollen and forms a fistula; and you must cure it as we have said in the sections, and it does not help: therefore you must make a burn cautery according to the quantity of the fistula; after making the hole or opening the fistula, and keep your hand as long as it takes for life to return to its place; or behind the limb; and do it once or twice, after the cure of what we have said in the cures, until it is sound; and if it is cured once, that is good; and if not, you must uncover the limb and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you find in your chapter.
Pain du mouvement des dents
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you have cured it with medicines and that does not suffice, then put the patient’s head in your hand; after remove the cautery whose form will come afterwards in this way as if you were putting on a pincer on the tooth; and put the cautery into the tooth cavity immediately, and hold your hand as long as the patient feels the heat coming from the root of the tooth; after let go of your hand and repeat the cautery as you please; after fill the patient’s mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and spit out the water.
And in this way the tooth which was moving is confirmed, and the softened gums are restrained, and the moisture corrupts dries out.
Of toothache.
When toothache comes from cold, or there is cold or heat, and medical treatments are of no avail, then there must be recourse to cautery in two ways: cautery of the carbuncle and cautery of the fire.</start_of_turn>
Cautery of the carbuncle is like this: take burnt barley and grind it to a powder; take a spoonful of the powder and place it on the tip of a rag, and moisten the bottom of the toothache with saliva; hold the toothache firmly in the barley until it is cold; and do this until the root of the tooth is softened.  When you see that the barley is limp and the cotton is wet, put the toothache back in place and put the iron on the tooth until the fire has died down at the bottom of the tooth.</start_of_turn
Cautery of the fire is like this: take a crucible of iron or charcoal, and make it big enough so that the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient; then heat the cautery until it is red hot, and hold it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cold; do this often, for the pain will be almost as great from the burning as from the toothache itself.  And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with much saliva in the course of this cautery, and then spit; for this is the form of the cautery:
When carbuncles are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not subject to digestion by medicines, then it is necessary to burn away the cautery beforehand as it comes to pass; for there are often several openings from the fumes to reach the cautery of the other part. And put the cautery hot upon the abscess once, or twice as much as the mixture will bear; and if the abscess is small, put the cautery on according to the quantity of the abscess, and leave it in for two days; and put upon moist cotton wool around it until the soreness is gone.  Then cure the wound of abscesses and tensions until it is healed.
When moisture prevails over the wind and cold, then it is fitting that the patient be relieved first by soluble medicines; afterwards perform the cautery at the root of the jaw, and hold it until you reach the jaw without causing further pain. Afterwards perform another cautery at the junction of the neck and the spine, and let the cautery which is called the "clamp" remain in place; and cure the limb as we have said above until it is healed.

Afterwards perform another cautery at the junction of the neck and the spine, and let the cautery which is called the "clamp" remain in place; and cure the limb as we have said above until it is healed. When all and diseases of the wind are from cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or sweating, and is an ancient disease, if you perform two cauteries on the forcele in their veins; and another cautery between two vertebrae; and let the cautery which is called the "clamp" remain in place as it is before said.
And if you see it, perform cautery at its point throughout which the cautery is named "points" for it forms thus in the disease of the ears; and let the points be done up to .xxx., or as much as necessary. After curing the limb according to what is above said, and let the cautery be done twice as many times as this form indicates.
And for this reason the cautery is lighter, for this reason that you do it twice as many times as before.
of the dislocation of the shoulder When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, hold the patient’s shoulders and chest; then take the thumb which is inside the armpit with your left hand; and if the joint is loosened, if it has slipped out of place, if it is showing, withdraw the cautery which is just as wide as the nail of the index finger:
and burn the thumb until it reaches the chest, and comes the escape of the cautery all together three times; for this is done with the cautery which has two nails, because the figures of cautery are these two nails; and the nerves are in proportion to the fineness of the attempt and this is the form of the cautery which has two nails.
And never is the suture placed upon this nerve for there are six cauteries there.
After placing the cautery over the broiled boils with silk; then rest the patient and do not allow the limb to hang tense for too long as to cause discomfort.</start_of_turn>
And if there is displacement below, whatever the cause, then make a cautery over the callous of the cautery staple, or several cauteries by pricking. For the joint is closed and the moisture is solidified and the patient is cured.</start_of_turn
because of the wound of the cautery
The ancient said that we must make for tears the cauteries of the root of Aristotle, and in part manner: take a root of Aristotle long, the greatest that thou shalt find, and dry, and as thick and as long as thy thumbs; and moisten in oil, and stamp at the fire, and cauterize. I. Cauterize between the forcele and the collarbone, and II. A few cauteries one at a distance in the part which is below the beard; and III. Cauterize between the fifth costal cartilage and the rib, declining behind one at a distance. I. Cauterize over the testicle, and I. another upon the stomach, and I. between two ribs, and I. two costae from the testis which oppose the cautery which is between two ribs; and do not press me thy hand, but make it open as when smelling.
And they say no ancient man uses a fire cautery resembling a razor, and throws it and puts it between the ribs, until it comes to this incision; and they leap forth from pain, as we have said in the incision of the liver. But in this work is fear or the patient dies now, or a fistula comes which cannot be healed.
of mice
When you treat the disease of the mouse of what we have said about the divisions of the cures, and it brings no profit, then there remain two methods of cautery which are good.
When you treat the disease of the mouse of what we have said about the divisions of the cures, and it brings no profit, then there remain two methods of cautery which are good.
and another method of cautery if it is that you burn off the nerve which has twelve nerves, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder; and hold the limb where the mouse is, or the patient’s shoulder comes toward the left side, and elevate the limb which you bind to the limb, according to the length of the bone, and burn according to the size of the bone.
After that, if the burn is not inflamed as much as the kernel is perceived from the other side, then take out the cautery and leave three. And if you see that the burn has progressed to the entirety of the burn, take out two hairs. After that, cure as soon as it has grasped by long tension, and thus is it as good as the other cures that have been said.

The cautery is not worth as much as an ipecacanth treatment, except for the manner which is called “asclytes”. When you treat according to the methods that we have said in the divisions, and your cure does not benefit, then it is necessary that you make three cauteries around the belly, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, and two at the back on the spine, and one in the buttock; and that the cautery be placed very close to the hair root.
After leaving the cautery open for a long time to stop the bleeding, do not leave the wound closed in the patient after the cautery; rather, let healing haste, and they will be bound together with the help of God.
The shape of the belly cautery is like a nail that we have before us; and the back is olive-shaped, as is seen here.</start_of_turn>
of the swelling of the pieces When the pieces are swollen in the hydropique patient, and are filled with yellow bile, it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the thumb between the auriculacle and the annular; and hold your hand with the cautery towards. And do not enter too deeply for fear of burning the yellow bile, and the cautery should be made in this form:
After having made two incisions in the thigh, cauterize the area around the knee; let the cauteries be long, one above the kneecap and the other below, in the middle of the thigh; leave the cauteries in place for a while, that they may adhere; then perform the other treatments that we have mentioned.

When solution of the belly comes from cold and moisture, as the protective and digestive virtue which is either the stomach or intestine is evacuated, and cannot be cured by means of treatment; and you see the patient very suffering and very pale, if you make a great burn on the stomach as it has been said above or burn the stomach, with the burn circulating; and three burns around the small intestine to all but the staple burn, and two burns on the flanks.
And if you see moisture abundant and the patient suffering, make the fire cautery on the navel, that is, cauterize on each side, and two small cauteries on the stomach below the great one, for the cure is profitable when there is good aid.

When hemorrhoids are deep-seated or multiple, and have been present for a long time, and are composed of thick, cold, and moist humors, they are cured as we have said in the divisions; and it is of no use to make cauteries: that is, two on the spine of the back, which is quite sufficient to drive away all the pain of the hemorrhoids, and two on the buttocks. The latter two should be made immediately;
If you think the stomach is cold, and the meat is not cooked, and the face is swollen, then the face must be subjected to a great cautery on the stomach, as it is said above; and another on the liver, and another on the spleen throughout the entire cautery clamp; and leave the cautery open for a long time. After that, cure the limb until it is healed.

After that, cure the limb until it is healed.
When you feel the thelul, if you withdraw the cautery which appears to burn, and then put it all ablaze on that thelul which is grasped; and leave it until the blood vessel comes to birth, without tension; do this once or twice. And if there is much thelul, if you cauterize each as we have said; after that, cure the wound with useful remedies until it is healed; and if you cauterize with a great cautery on the belly, it will be of greater help.
From an unhealed wound.
When the patient cannot endure pain or opening, as we have said, if there is some disease which can only be cured by cautery, then
When there is no fistula, and it is inflamed and discharges pus and moisture, if the physician desires to attempt a cure, and keeps that he will extract the foreign matter at all costs. After having evacuated the cautery which appears to have burned away, insert it into the fistula according to the degree of the attempt which has been made; and repeat the cautery until the burned and corrupted parts are gone, once or twice or thrice; take care of the nerves which are nearby and of the large veins. If the fistula is close to the bladder or intestine, take care of these organs as well, and do not do more than is necessary; and think that it is not always necessary to do this. After curing the wound until it is healed, if the foreign matter has been removed, and the tissues are tense, then extract the foreign matter; if the foreign matter is not ossified, extract it when the wound is healed, and corrupt it at the same time; and do the same as we have said concerning this matter.
De la maladie des reins. When pain in the flanks comes with swelling and great wind, and does not take nourishment from a woman, then it is necessary to cauterize the kidneys from one side to the other with the cautery needle which we have mentioned before; and if we cauterize it in the middle, if there are two cauteries in a line, it will bring more relief.</start_of_turn>
Of the bladder. When the bladder is full and weak of fruit and moisture, and the patient holds back urine, then one should cauterize on the lower part of the bladder, where the hair begins to grow, both towards the belly and towards the flanks, and make as many cauteries as there are pores; and one should also cauterize the back, or if necessary, the needle should be passed through the navel.
De la marris. When the marrow is cold and moist, and does not allow me to conceive, and the flowers are corrupted and their endings are late; and when they come, if they cause great pain: then it is advisable to make two cauteries around the knee, as we said before, or a cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries of the buttocks; or let the cautery be applied to the navel, as we said.
Of the hip
When viscous moisture descends to the hip socket, and because of this the limb moves differently, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together; and it is found that the hip joint is painful, if you must cauterize the patient on the hip socket like a circle, and sign in front of the limb around the socket if it turns, so that the socket is within the circle; and if the cautery is made like this as we have cauterized the stomach.
And if these cautery treatments are not present, make two olive-shaped cautery burns, and let the cautery be as strong as all the others; and cure until it is healed.
And if these cautery treatments are not present, make two olive-shaped cautery burns, and let the cautery be as strong as all the others; and cure until it is healed. When pain comes to the groin, due to cold and moisture, and the patient is cured of what we have said in the previous section, and the cure is not lasting, and the disease is old: therefore it is advised that you purge the patient of the foul humors through foul pills, or other solid pills that resemble them.
After the fire cautery; and the manner after the fire cautery is as follows: it is to say with an assembly of medicines and fire cautery. Fire cautery is as follows: for example, you cauterize upon the hip bone twice; you make three triangular cauteries as this, and you do it to a great depth and breadth, and there is between each cauterization an interval equal to the thickness of an olive, or the like. Never do you make a cautery in the middle of the head of the femur, for there are three of them according to this fashion.
And if you see that you have cauterized around the circle that we have said concerning the dislocation of the hip; but do it partly cautiously that the circle contains the whole hip, and all the thickness of the thigh is taut.
And this is how it is done in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip and does not reach the thigh or the leg. And if it comes to the thigh and the leg, you make three cauteries there or the patient says that the pain is there, and one cauterization under the ankle bone three times, on the left side one; and the cautery is either blunt or with a needle; and if the patient feels that the pain extends up to two fingers or almost as much, you cauterize at the place where the pain is felt twice or three times at the cauterization called the "points".
If the shoulder joint is stiff, make it more flexible; if the pain persists from the elbow to the hip, make an incision with the cautery knife, either straight or circular, and take good care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery too long, nor burn the nerves and large arteries, and do not cause the patient any greater pain or contraction.
I have seen many others who have cauterized the ankle bone without removing the spur, and left it so long that the limb was completely limp, and they were pricked through and through, and the whole limb was perforated and corrupted. After this there was death of the belly
If the pain is in several parts together, make an incision in one and the other, according to this manner. // And they say in the cautery of the hip, for example, you should make one such mark and be at the head as thick as a fist, or less, and be by interstitches and be from one interstitch to the other with the quantity of a bean; and let the interstitches be over two parts, and also like nails, and there should be one inch of leather well made. This is the shape:
And let the hair grow until it is all red and thick, and then put it on the patient’s thigh; and let the burn slowly over the skin; and burn once. Repeat the burn and leave it for two days. Then make an ointment of butter, and leave the wound open long and tight; after the cure of the wound while it is healed.
Albucasim says that our physicians often use this cautery because of its bad reputation, and that we often see those who use it; and all these are scorched bones, which can suffer from it, and where he takes care of himself.
of back pain.
When pain comes from the back, or from sitting or percussion or from too great an evacuation, or from similar things of cold expanding matter, none of these symptoms is worth cautery, save for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
When the patient is free from foul pills or other similar things, that we make on his back, there or where the pain is, three lines signed with a needle, and in a fourth line five cauteries or more according to the virtue and the quantity that the patient can suffer; and let the cautery be made according to the cautery called "poins"; and if you see, make two or three cauteries at the middle cautery according to this form:
Many times this disease comes as a small swelling, and its signs are that when it swells it hurts the loin and causes fear; and you find it behind the lower spine on the back and its appearance comes after the others.
When you see this and you see it healed, if you cauterize at the cautery of this circle according to this form.
When you see this and you see it healed, if you cauterize at the cautery of this circle according to this form. If it is necessary to cauterize some part of the spine, and if you see it, if you cauterize around the spine at the cautery marking one or two lines, and keep the points close to one another. After curing the limb until it is healed according to what we have said, and beware that you do not bring about further cautery in a hasty manner that is in vain of nerves.
of the pain of the joints
When joint pain arises from moisture that has spread throughout the limb, and when pain comes from a piece that is called "podagre" properly, and when the cause is cold and treated by medicines, it cannot be cured; if it is cured by cautery in part: make the mouth of the cautery enter the joint at the point of pain, and let the cautery be of the olive kind according to this fashion:
When there is need to prick the face of the limb, if you make the cautery throughout the whole area, call it "point". And if the pains come up to the joints and there are others, which often happens, make the cautery on each joint twice or thrice on each side, with the whole olive cautery; and if you must do more, if you make more, but do not keep your hand far from the fire until the thickness of the hair is as much as the beard.
And if the pains go down to the joints and the back, administer the cautery as we have said in this chapter. And if the pains are in the hands, if you make pricks around the nail twice. And if there is no longer any pain, if you make pricks on some joint and on the hair of the hand; and if the pains come up to the buttocks or the shoulder blades, if you cauterize some part, and make the patient govern himself well and take medicine. For if you make him govern himself and purge phlegm, he will be healed with the help of God.
From the root of the scapula.
When a fracture approaches the shoulder, and the ball comes loose as new, if you wish to cure it, do not break off the limb; and do use things that leave the belly open, so that the pain may go down from the belly; afterwards let him sit on his buttocks between your hands, and command him to hold his arm tight until the bone is healed, and keep it firm at your sides, and mark on the skin above the collarbone the extent of the fracture, and do all that is like half a circle below the bone. Then withdraw the cautery in this form:
... until it is soft and limp. Then reattach the ball to its place; and the minister should hold his hand so that it does not recoil; and provide good sutures for the patient, and put some lint and some thread on the wound, and another on his wrist; then place the cautery on the mark on his whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you have fixed the bone, and if you do not succeed the first time, if you start again until you reach the bone; and beware diligently that the ball does not slip while you are making the cautery; that you do not burn it; and that by this means the patient does not die, or any other mishap.
And if you do not come up to the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing. It is necessary that the cauteries of small people be subtle in measure, and those of great people also great in measure; after two days, cure the burn until the scab is bony; after that, cure other ailments until they are healed, and keep the patient forty days on his back until the wound is well closed; and make sure that his movements are lazy so that he does not bleed when he moves to his bed.
After forty days, when he wants to rise, let him be accompanied by a well-made staff and keep him for forty days; and give him good rest, that he work little and abstain from drinking too much wine and eating too much, and from excessive laughter; and when he has followed this teaching, if he is well, he will be entirely healed. And I will tell you afterwards about the treatment of your ailment in this chapter. of the treatment of the belly.
When routes come into other bellies and are known, and you see that they do not grow any more, then make a second cautery according to their quantity, and a third of the dose; after which treat according to what we have said; and none of the ancients have said that it should be cauterized at two angles according to this form.
But first mark the edge with a line along the width of the route, and another at the other end, and hold your hand firmly over the entire cautery. But the first cauteries are lighter and softer
...there is no greater pain in any limb. When pain arises in any limb, whether from injury or ailment, and the pain persists for a long time, medical treatment is of no avail; therefore, it is recommended that it be cauterized with the cautery known as the "poins," or with a cautery according to the length of the limb, its smallness and weakness, its toughness and its tortures, and its pain. If successful in the first cautery, well and good; if not, repeat the procedure once more for it is customary to effect the cauteries as close to the diseased part as possible, so that the pain is relieved while the disease is still present.

The moisture is never of any avail by cautery; great aid is only obtained from it when dealing with the initial stages of disease caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy. If you see the disease being cauterized, take care that the disease is in its early stages; if it is cured according to what has been said in the division, and if it does not linger, you may doubt that the corruption has spread throughout the whole disease; therefore, make five cauteries on the head: one at the nape of the neck, and the other toward the front at the end of the beard; two on the two corners, and one behind the earlobe; and leave the hand as long as the cauteries are in progress until the bones are reached, and as long as the surrounding humors escape through the incisions, so that the vapors of the bad humors can escape. Cauterize the head according to what is seen before it.
If the mess is scattered everywhere; and it appears manifestly, if you must indeed cauterize with these cauteries which we have spoken of or chief, namely the cautery in some places you desire not to, and two cauteries on the armpits, and three on the spine of the neck, and one great on the hip and one other from below, and two on the two scapulae, and two on the flanks, and two on the tendons of the wrist and elbow, and one on almost every joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands; take heed of the nerves that are behind the calcaneus, that you do not burn them; and in no way perform cautery on the bone of the heel or on the bone of the stomach, or on the liver.
When you make more cauteries, the more you do to aid, and the more you profit from it; and when the patients do not feel pain from the cautery, as they would if they were healthy, because their flesh is already corrupted. And you must know that the cauteries should be great and small according to the limbs and joints, as you do in handling herbs. After treatment with flour of several times with honey and other treatments until they are healed.
of swelling.
When swelling comes to any limb and is cured with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not entirely healed, then you must make cauteries on the limb according to the size and degree of the swelling; and either make the cauteries a little deeper than the depth of the nerve that moves the limb; then cure with ointments until it is healed. And never make a cautery on the hand, foot, or back, at the exit of a nerve that moves the limb, and so if it is bony the swelling will remain. And in no way should anything be interposed that does not know the limbs and the exits of the moving nerves from the bones.

When the disease called "albaras" is present, and medicine is of no avail, then you must make a cautery with a needle a little deep, according to the depth of the tissue, until the swelling is bony and has changed color; then cure with flour of times, lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, with colon and alum, a part of each; mix them all together, and bind with a bandage, and keep it in place until healed.
The cure for chancre by cautery
When the chancre first begins, and you see it stop, if you cauterize at the cautery that seems like a circle, put all around the circumference of the chancre. And everyone says that it should be cauterized in the middle of the chancre; however, I do not think that is good because I fear that it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen several times that it is better to cauterize around the circumference, at the circle cautery, as we have said in our teaching of cautery.
of the swelling that cannot be measured
When anyone has an ailment which is called "adubelati", and it lingers without healing or because of excessive swelling that the patient makes or because of the weight of the ailment when it is decrepit (that is, too great), and there is much blood, or for fear; and you see it hastening to heal: then cauterize around the mouth of small cauteries by pricking; afterwards leave it alone. For it will haste to heal.
And if you see it turning pale with all the cautery, if it is hot, take away the cautery for a moment: thus is the shape
And put your hand in the middle of this ailment which is called "adubelati" as long as the cauteries perceive the heat, and be such cauteries that the patient feels relief in part as the disease progresses. After that cure until it is perfectly healed.
The fire cautery. Instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even. And if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.

the wounds that come from the heel to the toe.
Many times it happens that when a piece of flesh has departed from its place, a disease arises which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and is a great burdensome thing that boils up like the scum of the earth. And the cautery of this disease is in two ways. Namely, fire cautery and hot water cautery. Fire cautery is that which is done by the eschaufleur; that is, the cautery is made like a pennace of a nail, and is done with a piece of iron of the measure that it can penetrate the abscess of all parts, and that there are subtle margins; after this put all around the abscess, and hold your hand firmly over the abscess until it comes to the front of the abscess; and leave it like this for two days until it begins to discharge pus; then make an poultice of bruised mallow seeds with gum, and leave the poultice on all night, and close the abscess firmly and will be drained of its roots. Then cure the wound by applying char until it is healed.
And if they are converted by boils in the hands and in pieces, if you must bring them to the surface, do the hot water cautery; and this is in part as follows: take a splinter of flax or iron, or a nail of pitch, and put it on the abscess and the dressing; that is, make incisions around the edges; and put the splinter on so that it reaches all around, then put on some warm oil, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand by turning so that the edge of the splinter comes to the root of the abscess, and can find the hot water going deep to the root; and give the patient a sip of the hot water for an hour; then leave it like this, and it will discharge all its roots. Do this again and again until you have drained all that is in the abscess, and then cure the wounds that have resulted from the char.
you cure the tremor.
When some shiver from cold, or from a quartan fever or from any other, if you make for them three or four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between the shoulder blades, and one cautery or pinch on the stomach at the olive cautery, if you leave them to tremble, they will soon recover from the cold sickness.

Whenever the body is covered in boils, or pus-filled abscesses, that come from corrupt matters, if you make a cautery on each head of the abscess at the first appearance: a subtle cautery of fir tree ash, from which the point should be grasped by the fire, or of elderberry root long, or the lenticular cautery. And never should the abscesses be cauterized before they appear, according to this method, for they will not burst forward, but the superflux from which they come is broken, and they are healed; but it must be done after the evacuation of blood.
When the artery is cut. When the artery is cut, there are often great discharges of blood from the artery that is cut at the wound that comes from the surgeon, or at the incision of the abscess, or at the cautery of the limb, and similar things; and it is a mournful thing to extend oneself.</start_of_turn>
And whenever this happens to anyone, if you are hasty to put your finger on the wound of the vein, and strain it out too much without calming it down, and blood does not stop flowing; then take away several small and large olive cauteries as soon as they are red, and touch them to the wound, that is, great or small as is appropriate for the wound and the limb in which the artery is cut, and put the cautery on that vein or hold your finger there, and hold the cautery as long as necessary.</start_of_turn
And if it spurts blood when you take your finger away from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, take hold of another cautery quickly that is on the fire.
And do not cease to perform this one after the other until the limb is completely stretched out; and beware that you do not damage the nerve that is below, and that no other harm comes upon the patient; and stretch the limb until, without drawing blood from the artery, it can be satisfactorily restored to its normal position, except in three ways that we have mentioned: or by cautery, or by extraction when necessary, or by strong ligation with thread, or by medicines that are placed upon it and which have power to restore blood flow.
Whoever brings about a restoration of the limb by means of tight draping or of placing things burning upon it, or other similar things, will not profit thereby unless he does so in the right way.</start_of_turn>
And if this happens to be the case and there is no remedy or medicine present, he must place his thumb on the wound of the vein as we have said, and keep it still until it is restored beneath the wound and beneath the vein; and do not move it, but moisten it with cold water often so that it is cold as much as the limb is frozen and engrosed and restored; and make incisions in front of those which must be cauterized and medicated.</start_of_turn>
We have already said in the first chapter that in all diseases where it is necessary to cauterize with fire or apply burning medicine, we must inquire into the omens, causes, instruments, and shapes of the cauteries; and in this chapter we will speak of the chief matters that we have found to be lighter in this way than in others.</start_of_turn>
And thus, although I begin this chapter, it is necessary, my son, to teach you that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first cauteries, and for this reason more caution is required.</start_of_turn
For in the work of this chapter, there is often the evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and many die.</start_of_turn
And I warn you that you should not be rash. For many people come to healing in various ways. If they come from those who have suffered greatly with their ailment and who move easily through the force of their ailment, and from the greatness of their malice; of these things we must have fear. And from these there are some who will tell you, "Wait, I am ready"; and the ailment is grievous. It is not right that you should yield only to those who come to you who have this manner, but put more great caution in your honor than in your covetousness, and do not be rash more than wisely in what you are certain of, and what you have learned; and use prognostication and indication in the treatment of your patients so that health is either saved or transformed; and this will help you to achieve good fame, glory, and memory forever.</start_of_turn>
Very dear son, our lords teach you to understand and fear, and if you are filled with the spirit of the Holy Inspiration of his hand, amen.</start_of_turn>
Or I vos ai ordonné cet chapitre en divisant par Chapitre, selon ce qui est devant ou Chapitre des cauteres, que I vos ai devisé de la tête jusqu’à la pied, pour ce que vous trouvez plus facilement ce que vous avez à faire.
Or I have ordered this chapter by dividing into chapters, according to what is before or the chapter of cautery, that I have devised from the head to the foot, so that you can find more easily what you have to do.
The disease comes out of the belly of women in childbirth, and when the boy cries too much the head of the child is strained; and never comes from a known cause except that it is not treated.</start_of_turn>
The fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
And I have never seen such a disease as this except in childhood, when the head of the shoulder was completely swollen with fluid, and the bone grew so much that it could not support itself; and I thought that the moisture was too great, and this moisture, if it is gathered on the bone above the scapula, between the shoulder blade and the bone; and the work is like this if the moisture is between the shoulder blade and the bone, and the incision is small, that you must make a wide incision; and it should be as long as.ij. we, until the moisture is gone. And when this is done, the shape of the scapula will be like that of a spindle.
If the moisture is deeper and the incision is larger, if you make.ij. incisions in the manner of a cross, following this shape:
If moisture is outside the bone and you see the edges of the fracture protruding beyond the skin, and it increases in pain when you press it with your hand from within; if this does not settle: if you suspect that there are two fractures, make two incisions according to this method:
After the incision, draw out the moisture forcefully. Then tighten the fractures with strips of cloth and powder, and apply wine and oil, and leave it until the fifth day; then remove it, and cure the wound with sutures and bandages, and leave the limb elevated, and feed the patient dry food until the limb is comfortable and healed.</start_of_turn>
Another method of incision is to look or open the abscess, and gather the pus; for it is never before; never behind; never to the right; and never to the left.
Taille donques lai ou li aposteme apert, et l’emplissement de l’aigue, et lou fent selonc ce que tu en as le pooir; et warde que tu ne coper l’artere; et veigne flun de sanc, si que li malaides nirvana dou decorrement de sanc et de l’evacuation de moistor.
If the shoulder or the armpit is open, and the injection of liquid, and you do according to what you are able; and beware that you do not cover the artery; and let the vein flow blood, so that the patient may die without excessive bleeding and evacuation of moisture.
When there is no other disease which is called "catarrh" that has its cause in the teeth or the gums, and the disease is ancient, and the treatment of medicine does not help, then the only cure is to cauterize with that which will cover the arteries.
It is not possible for me to provide a translation of the given text, as the provided text is in Old French and I am unable to translate languages.
If you see, grasp the sponge with two fingers and hold the artery below, cutting as much as two fingers must pass through.
When the vein is cut, if blood spurts continuously upwards, stop it immediately
If the artery does not open despite feeling, if you deem that two fingers’ breadth is sufficient, mark the spot and proceed until bone; and whatever is beyond that, do not attempt to remove it with the forceps. If it is more or less by chance, as the patient can tolerate, and the expansion of the artery; then look at the wound: if it remains on the bone point where the stitches were removed, if the edges of the incisions do not rejoin, then strain the wound and bind it, and cure it until it is healed.

When ancient eye discharge comes, and acute catarrh, because of tears and the discharge in temples and the old socket are lost, and similar things, and it is treated by medical cures and all that does not help, if the arteries of the temples are extracted and cauterized, as we have said.
And thus is the method of extracting them [arrows] that if the patient make retreat the hairs from his temples, and understand to the artery which opens in the temple, for it opens well by its beating, and is often returned full rather than in other men who are too rough; and if it is returned, the patient must stretch his neck with some folds, then wipe the limb of any rough scab, and rise the limb of warm water until the artery opens manifestly; then take the sponge which is like this shape:

For if it is not broken, it will not jump out without pain throughout.

For the fire cautery is helpful for finishing off moisture: for this is why it is more useful for moisture. For it is useful to extract the arteries when they are filled with much cotton and held in well-made bands; and when they are released, if they are cured with dry medicines that cause the hair to grow, and the bands, until they are healed; and if you do not have the artery held in place as you ought, if you are in a hurry to cover with cautery, or if you use vinegar in the hand that is holding it, it will stain; and if you do not have that, if you must remove the hand, you must do so while it is still warm, and wash the hand with cold water until it stops bleeding, and hold it steady as you should; and what is more gentle and easier in the extraction of the artery is to cauterize the vein of this cautery at the depth of a third, but the depth should be well spaced in order to prevent the heat from lasting too long. For when the instrument is too tense, it holds less heat. The fire must have between the joints a space of one inch. Then when you have marked the joints, leave the loop of the needle burning above until it comes up to the bone, and grasp the vein with the needle; and let the hair be plucked between the joints because it is not soldered by this cautery in any way. This is the form of the cautery:

When the tears of the eyes descend from the veins that are above the test of the chief of force, and it does not profit from any medical cure in this way, and you see the face of the patient contort, and feel that the front of the body is limp as if from fear; and since they are tense and moist if the papers are held close, and are scraped by the heat of the tears, if there is any hope of this cure.
And they call it the old 'cure contuse'. Make the patient grow a beard as long as his front; then make two incisions or an even front according to the length of the front; and let one incision be just as wide as two lips swallowing saliva until it reaches the navel, and the other let the ribs be held up by papers; and keep the incision of the arteries that are held up by papers. Keep your hand steady at the continuation of the jawbones; and if there is any wound, measure its quantity over the joints.
from the incision which is over the temple until the second incision; and squeeze all the marrow which is between the two incisions to the very surface of the bone, then do the rest of the wound until the other second, and then remove this thumb and index finger.
If in the first fissure the instrument which is called the "cultellaire", and is very well cut on one side, and on the other is smooth, do not cut deeply, and this is its form: If in the first fissure the instrument which is called the "cultellaire", and is very well cut on one side, and on the other is smooth, do not cut deeply. And place the cutting edge towards the cartilage at the shoulder, and the smooth edge towards the bone, and hold tight until it reaches the middle fissure. And remove all the blood vessels that descend from the head as long as the incision is continuous until it reaches the shoulder, and then do the same in the middle of the fissure until it reaches the other edge; and then draw out the blood equally, express the wound for the blood taken; then put in the wound the dressing of a little cotton tent, and put on wet cloths soaked in wine and oil and balsam, and keep that the stitches should not be visible; and at the end remove the ligature and insert a great number of stinging nettle leaves, then cure with basic ointment with rose oil, and other cures which are used for wounds, until it is healed.
because of repeated swelling
When no acute burning comes, and you see the eyes tense and small, and the pupil dilate, and the papers burn; and the hair cries out, and where previously there was no pain, now there is great pain, and the patient expels; then it is certain that from these symptoms and the burning which comes from many veins, there is no other remedy except to cure the root of the matter.
And command the patient to rest his forehead, then make a great incision from the left temple to the right temple, and so on from the left side to the right. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and reach the bone; and withdraw your hand from the nerves of the temples that move to the marrow; and when the bone is exposed, if there is blood, drain all the blood with a sponge, and then withdraw between the two layers of the incision and put in cotton wool, and try to hold it in place; then cover with wet cloths soaked in wine and oil, and keep it from moving; when it is healed, it is certain that you will massage the bone until it begins to grow back, and then cure it with drying things that make it callous.</start_of_turn>
In part: take three parts of wheat flour and three parts of colophony, and make a poultice; and administer it to these wounds to make it callous throughout.</start_of_turn>
From the swelling of the ears
Everything that causes swelling of the ears is among these things: grains, or pus, or stone or other foreign bodies like iron; or seeds, like peas, beans, or beans; or fluid-filled things like urine and saliva or other things.</start_of_turn>
When there is a stone or other foreign body in the ear or in any other way that does not fit into the ear, do not put the ear up to the sun. If you see the stone, if no violet oil or oil of lavender comes out, then extract it; and let him spit out some mustard seeds, and stamp the nostrils when he spits, and put round the ear pieces of cloth or wool; and keep the ear still. Many times this cure comes out by itself; and if it does not come out, it is necessary to extract it with fine needles, as is the form:
If it comes out by itself, that is good; if not, extract it with a fine needle of double curvature; and if it does not come out even with that, make an injection of ointment and cut off the top of the injection or break the ear very much, and stamp what is around the injection of ointment if it comes out and cannot enter with the needle; then the pain will cease, for often it comes out by itself as we have said; and if it does not come out in part, take hold of the ear and put on no instrument that can cause injury, and put a little cloth over; then press the hold on the stone or whatever it is, and the pain will cease. If these things fail, if you are in haste to make an incision at the ear root or at the base of the jaw, and spasm, do as follows: make the first incision at the front of the head, and drain blood in accordance with its quantity. Then seat the patient between your hands and turn the ear downwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear, at the fatty or bony prominence. Make the incision as wide as a crescent, until you reach the bone, and remove the pus promptly from your mouth. Continue the treatment until the wound is healed. If it is a grain that is ensnared and swells, administer extraction; if it cannot be extruded, administer a sponge held tightly according to this form:
If it is a grain that is ensnared and swells, administer extraction; if it cannot be extruded, administer a sponge held tightly according to this form: make an incision of that grain. But do not do this until you have made many attempts; then extract with forceps and suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is aligned.
In acute cases, when the ear aches, the patient must immediately apply pressure to the ear with the thumb and index finger, and fill the ear with cotton wool. And if the ear is still painful, do so while pressing on the ear itself or on the side of the ear; if that does not suffice, take many stones and press them along the length of the ear, keeping the thumb and index finger pressed to the ear; and remove the patient’s earwax with one hand and the stones with the other; and press one stone on the ear from the other side, and hold it down on the ear that is in the ear; and do not stop pressing the stones until the pain has entirely disappeared; and as soon as the pain has gone, remove the stones. If you see that the pain persists, take the thumb and index finger of the other hand and press one of the stones into the ear, and press the other stone with the thumb until the most intense pain has passed; then repeat the process with the other stones until the pain has entirely gone, as we have said concerning the stone.
In the extraction of the tooth, if it is of small size, like a flea and other small things, cure it as we have said in the preceding division; but if it is of large size, you can feel it; in such a case, extract the tooth. It is the easiest thing to remove that which is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms from the ear, when you have cured as we have said in the preceding division or performed distillations, and the cure has not been of benefit, if you wish to be certain, look at the ear in the sunlight: if there are no worms visible, if there are only superficial scratches, and if there are none, take the tweezers which are of this shape:
And let the wound be broad and deep. And keep the upper part of the ear in proportion to the extent of the suffering of the patient, then proceed with the cautery; do this often until you see that all the smoke has escaped. And if they do not obey in this, if I press upon the edge of the cotton as I have said in the stone; and if they do not emerge forcefully as we have said, give distillations which the ancients have proved effective in the cutting of worms, and you will find them or treat them with distillations; and if you distill your oils and medicines into the ear with all these instruments, this is the form as you see.
And let the wound be of silver or gold, be it small losses, and above put on for distillation; and press from within the distillation with a well-made instrument of gold, as I have said, and if you see take a scraper and wrap around the point immediately cotton; then I pour out your oil or juice, and what you see of your medicines in the can, and the can be in the ear; then put back the scraper on all the cotton, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled or almost all the ear; and let the patient feel it within, and let the distillation be neither too hot nor too cold, for the medicine will not be so good.
of the swelling of the ears
No child is born without some hole in their ear; and the same thing happens at home through wound bursting or earwax being blocked in the ear, for these bursts never happen without leaving a mark on the ear, if one does not see; and never happens without a certain degree of loss of hearing, which one sees very well.
When these bursts happen without being seen, they are a sign of serious illness in many cases, and in this case one sees that you put the painful ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the opilation apparent, if the swelling has completely disappeared, this is the form:
And be it greasy or slimy before and behind all around, if it does not bleed the ear; if the opilation is of pus or earwax, if you see little pinpricks, and the swelling is lighter, as long as the pus is entirely bony.
If the swelling has penetrated the ear, take a fine needle and pierce a small hole in the ear, then put in an ear drop. If you feel the swelling which the patient feels in the ear, pierce slightly, and do not pierce the nerve of the ear; then put in the ear a patch according to the size of the hole, and the pus in the Egyptian manner.
Do nothing more until the wound is healed; take a swab and mix it with rose-water and powdered vitriol; if you see the swelling flee the ear, it is likely that you have pulled out the swab. Put in another swab soaked in oil of roses and beeswax until the swelling is bony; then cure it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If there is discharge of blood, soak a sponge and wring it out in cold water, and put it on the ear, and use other treatments that will stop the bleeding such as applying distillations.</start_of_turn>
De la char des papiers.
From the heap of papers
And if without decor, if the cautery of the lenticular scar is done without incision, and the cautery is done afterwards, it is worth moving; and many times it repairs itself, so that nothing remains of its root; and when they are cauterized by fire, if they are burned those roots and do not return again.
De la gresle.
Many times come papers with blood that seems to coagulate in its form and hardness; and for this reason this disease is called "granulin," and is an assembly of large moisture in the substance of the wound; the work is like this: take warning if the granulin moves from one side to the other, and that is a light matter; then make a mark with the thumb and index finger, then grasp the wound firmly, and pull. If you do not pull it with force enough to see some blood, it will grieve the patient nothing; but if the wound is large, if the assembly has a support, and the cure as much as it is healed; and if it is small, do not use force, for it will heal itself quickly and leave a scar.
If the granulin descends downwards towards the ear towards the upper part, reverse the wound, and bring the granulin to a few pinches; grasp and press from one side to the other; and if the wound is stripped by the incision, it will grieve nothing; and when the wound is closed, leave the dirty oil, and cure the limb of that which leaves a scar as long as the patient is healed.
from the fat of the blood
Exinach is a fat that is smeared on papers of fine texture, and this is more effective for those who have no nails, and grieve much at their eyes, and they come out with tears at dawn, and they cannot bear the sight of the sun because their tears are too hasty at their eyes; and because they lie with their faces down, and sleep on their backs, and their papers are soaked with their tears which swell and appear covered in exinach which is released in oil. And when you press their limbs and feel the exinach between their toes.
When the patient puts his head in order; then take one drape of linen, and make a loop in the manner of a circle according to the quantity of exinach from the chest part, and put it on; and press on the thumbs from one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered into the circle; then make in the middle of the moisture at the tip of the knife a wound not larger than the wound made to the vein; and make the skin taut as long as you see the exinach; and in various situations comes exinach from the wound, according to the shape of a white piece of fat.
Pull out all the fatty tissue from the piece of cartilage between your thumbs at the back, and twist your hand to the right and to the left as much as possible; and keep that you do not bring together in the wound, that you do not reach the whole thickness just until the oil, that you do not stain it.
And if it escapes not at the beginning of the incision, if you expand a little the incision lightly until it opens; then draw it out as we have said, and moisten the edges with oil and water, and put on the limb, and strain it gently.
And if there are such people who break their bones and put on them to support the moisture that is gone. Then cure them until they are healed. And if it comes to the limb again with swelling, if you cure abscesses that swell up until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
paper hair
When paper-like tissues grow hair-like bristles other than their natural state, and are thickened, if they irritate the eyes, they cause various diseases such as tears, and softening of the paper-like tissues and mucus, as well as the destruction of the hairs; and the cure for this is in three ways: either by whole-body cautery with fire, or by means of water medicine as I have said, or by incision and stitching or by sutures, as I shall say.
You must place the patient’s hand over your left hand; if the paper changes, that is good; if not, if there is an awl with a single thread at the root of the hair; whether you cut the edge of the paper or the hair sprouts from these hairs, take a single thread from the root of the hair to the tip of the paper, and stretch it out; then pull out the hair from the root, from the root of the bristles to the tip of the nail; then draw out the single thread, and put on the paper a small patch of cotton and bandage, and mark on the paper a sign like the mark of a thrush, and know that the sign must be in accordance with the quantity of the paper that you see being lifted that is required for all.
And if there is much paper that has been softened in any part, then make at least two lines from the sign you have made; from the great nail to the little one; and if there is an opening near the natural hair in the thickness of a root, then close the opening in one of the two angles of the knee, then pull out all the hair; then gather the two layers together with a suture of a fine thread of wool, and wipe off the blood, and make air the excess of threads on the two edges of everything you have glued, as you see; and if you do not see this, do not cure, but leave the suture and the threads for two or three days; then cure the wound with something dry and constricting, because the paper returns to its place under the wound and the gathering of the two layers, but the suture is useless (as the old people say), and this is work without fear;
And if in another manner: if you mark the mark of a figure that is just like the head of a myrtle, as we have said, at that point two needles must be drawn out following the shape that is there.
Then hold together that which is above with small forces equally following the shape that is there.
And if you do not have the power to hold the nails, and the thing is not even, if you take a needle or there is a thread, and you pass it through the mark; and you pass another thread from above the great scar, and the second thread from below the small one, and you assemble between your two the two threads equally; then hold your hand equally, and hold all the skin above where you have marked, as we have said, then assemble the two layers of the wound by stitching, and cure until it is healed; and if there is an abscess at your incision, if you apply cerate and other soothing ointments.
And never has it happened that the hairs of the beard are converted: if you use what we have said about incision; but the costure in one and the other is more artificial.
The cure for boils is as follows: convert the beard and the hair inwards as I have said, then make four incisions by art, and four fine threads as long as the beard and the diameter of a hazelnut; and put in four hairs or hold the threads. Then assemble the one and the other firmly on that which rests on the oil of the beard; strain the four incisions from the four parts forming; and leave it so for several days, and the skin which has been strained will become pale and wrinkled and will swell, until it heals by itself.
If it is late, if the wound has force, then cure it until it is healed; and when the wound has healed, if the beard has fallen out, it will not prick again; and this is the form of the four incisions that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
The work is such that you grasp a fine needle, and there is inside it a thread of silk fine and subtle; then assemble the hairs and do not knot one with the other subtly, and let the length of the thread be as long as a palm; then command in the chase another thread subtle of silk briefly, and do not knot the chief with the thread; then put the patient's chief in your hand; and let go of the sun if the work is clarified, for it is a subtle and light work, then withdraw the needle at all the chase in the root of the hair which grows naturally; then pull out the hair until it breaks at the root as much as you pull out naturally; then draw out the hand as much as the vein escapes at all the chase in the palm with the natural hair.
If the chase is treated and the hair does not come out with it, if you draw out the chase to the end of the thread that you have commanded, until the chase vein comes out from under and you see it through the vision of the oil; then if you draw out the chase and the thread, close the oil and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair comes back to its place and the burden is gone.
of the corruption of the oil
When this disease which is called 'aleacrati' or the inflammation comes to the head, if there are two methods: one natural, and the other unnatural. And it comes from an abscess, or from a wound or cautery, and from similar things.
And the way to work in this is that you make this suture, dry the flesh of it, put inside some threads of linen, and keep it until it is healed; and do not do anything else except use things that dry and tighten. For if you do that, if the disease comes back worse than before; but there is need for soft things, like fennel; and the rose of aquilegia or elderberry and flaxseed should be boiled, and aquilon ointment should be melted in none of the oils, and it should cover a bandage, and it should be cured like this.
And the treasure of your cure is that you must take care that it does not heal differently from the form it had before; and this work that we have said is not fierce except for addressing this disease, that it does not return differently from the form it had before.
Of the fire that comes from the oil.
This disease which is known as scaldure which really is apeled "axacrati", is natural and accidental. The accident comes from wound and fissure and cautery and things which are similar; and the way of this ailment is that if you take a needle, because it has two threads, and the thread is in the oil, and it causes the left eye to shed tears so that the thread of the vein is in two pieces at the end of the needle, and the thread is above the skin at the whole of the needle, and the head has one spatula wide.
And if the wound comes back as it should, that is good; if not, take a needle and put it in the wound, and rotate the wound, and make two incisions or break through twice the thickness of the wound; and let two angles be made at the two ends of the incision that you have made, and make one angle so that when they are reunited, the limb should look like the letter that has not "j griesche"; then break that bone, according to the quantity of cost and moisture, of what is in the wound, then join the two broken ends, and bind with a thread of linen; then cure from what we have said of the mollifying medicines and bandages, until it is healed
If the ailment comes from a fracture, sprain or cautery, if it is known that there is hair loss from papery substances, and as above; then separate between the two leaves of a tent, as I have said; and it must be carried out according to the form of the ailment, for it is diverse in form, and the wise masters appear to know everything better than I do concerning the return of the limb to its natural shape; and the patient himself, according to what is convenient for him and the instruments in more numerous positions.

When this stiffness arises at home in part as the limb above is soothed with white oil, and cannot move or perform its natural works, if it is known that the bone has been fractured, then it must be bled from the point of a scraper from below the bone, and held up high; and the edges must be bound as tightly as possible, without causing excessive pain, for the patient cannot endure too much pain or excessive bleeding; and the incision, which you have made, must be slight, so that the limb returns to its natural shape; and all that is assembled must be thoroughly cleansed, and no longer washed in salted water, but with fresh water, and oil; and between the bone and the oil put a bandage of lint, and cover the oil with coarse wool in abundance; and after that apply a support as much as is necessary until it is healed.

The fennel oil has two kinds: one is nervous and somewhat dark like pitch, and the other is not nervous but is like pale moisture that solidifies when touched by iron and becomes black like soot; both of them begin to soften towards the great marrow, and grow so much that they cover the whole cavity and the brightness and movement of the oil.
And as for the incision, if the patient places his head in its right place, then hold the eyes; then grasp the hair with your hand, then take a needle and make a small incision at the root of the hair; insert one hair of a horse, or of a sheep, or of a bull, and a strong thread; double the point of the needle once and pass the needle through the hair, and grasp the hair with the thread and pull it out, and with all the hair surrounding the root that surrounds the nail and the hair to the root, then cut away all the superfluous tissue until only a little bit of the natural oil remains; and if there is no other discharge from the incision, do not extend the incision alone, but with the thread as we have said; then stretch out the surrounding tissue as much as possible.
And keep that the spatula does not touch the fatty tissue and breaks it, and that the needle is not perceived; and after the incision pour oil a little bit of bruised salve, and apply a bandage, and leave it until the other side; then cure what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not nerveous, and you cannot push out the needle, and the thread does not go in, many times this semblance of a nail of medicine is cured; and as I have said in the division, if you see it covered, if you pour oil on the patient, and take the spatula lightly according to this form:
And remove the nail gradually, and if you see that it has diminished point and the wound is pressing, if you distill from your mouth into the oil bandage make of alum and red salve, and bruise the salve, and squeeze out the oil until the other side; then repeat the other operation according to this same operation, until it is completely healed.
If nothing opposes you in the oil, as with an abscess, then milk first and cure the abscess thoroughly while it is sound, then repeat the work as before, while it is sound.
If there appears in the oil at night a piece of soft tissue that causes great swelling, if you suspend it on an onion and cut off a part and not all, that blood does not arise; then distill in the red oil of colera which is made from litharge.</start_of_turn>

The eyes of some men are never red with anger, and cover the pupils and hold them tight with paper; and appear like a rosebud. And if the patient puts his head in his bosom, then he covers the eyes, and all that colour is left with a convenient amount of yellow, and the colour is strong; then he severs the first colour, and goes on severing until the end, and he keeps only the white of the eye at the work; and let the incision be deep as the incision of the vein and have little force, as it is shown after this chapter.
When the incision is complete and all the colour is gone, if you use sesame oil bruised or you distill collyrium red and similar corrosive medicines, and put on the oil cotton with a little egg white, so that it is firmly fixed; and if it does not stop, and the patient vomits, and you doubt the depth of the incision, if you leave the oil and cure the abscess with soothing things. Then return to your work when it is healed, and then do the incisions again when the colours are added to the oil in this way.
But always know that you should temper the treatment with a weak oil of natural origin; and by chance, in the work of iron; and do not move your hand in any of these works until you see that this limb is suffering from that work.
Des voines des eulz.
The veins of the eyes.
Red veins covered with oil, tolerate the gaze of the eye and expel the oil throughout the days. The surgeon must therefore be the first to notice if the oil is strong; for there is no other disease more violent than a wound; therefore the surgeon should act immediately: instruct the patient to put his head in a normal position, then suspend those veins to the utmost extent of his skill, and do so discreetly in the following manner:

And if you cannot bear all this in that hour, make an ointment from oil and soothing things to soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it on for some days until the pain is appeased and the swelling has subsided; then repeat according to this manner until you are well; this is the way of strength.

The mire is called "arissati": when you cure it with cautery and medicine with burning water, as I have said before, and it is not completely healed, if there is still something remaining on the incision, leave it in place and drain all the moisture from it, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone breaks, and you see the corruption and blackness, if the limb has all the elements to be whole; it is called an "aspre chief," and be made of burnt ivory, that is, a broken bone, and be pointed out as with a lime as when it is in this form.
And put on the limb the broken bone, then twist it between your two hands, and press your hand until you feel that the corruption is reset; do this never, then restore the limb of exiccative medicines.</start_of_turn>
If the limb is swollen and char is not born, and the bone of the bow is swollen, and remains for eighty days, and does not recover and is not better with treatment, and accidents happen not because of that; know that it is sane; if this is not the case, if there is no other remedy than to restore the fistula to its proper place without delay according to this form: and that is to uncover the bone the second time by iron, and by watery medicines, and when it is uncovered take it out as before according to this form, and make the incision at two angles, and the wound should be narrowed down as much as you see fit:
Then place your thumb on the bone below the elbow, and move your hand away from the oil.i. immediately, then pull the limb back until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it through what comes from under his arm if he keeps his hand on his elbow.  Then restore the dry medicine, as I have taught you, and when the wound heals and the limb endures, if there is still matter in the elbow; if it is a lighter matter for the patient.

Then restore the dry medicine, as I have taught you, and when the wound heals and the limb endures, if there is still matter in the elbow; if it is a lighter matter for the patient.
When the limb opens all at once, and there is no displacement of the navel, no swelling, if you must bind the patient; then loosen it, and put on a bandage or dressing in a circular fashion to suck out the wound, then put on oil.i. with acaice and aloe and incense and beeswax, and then strain the oil, and replace it with lint and cloth; and keep the cloth in place if you take cloth enough soft, and double bandage in three layers, and then put one on top of the other according to the quantity that the wound has in it; then strain it by pressing down with a stiff bandage, and reapply the dressing to suck out the wound in a circular fashion; then tie the dressing and leave the oil strained for a night, and if the wound has softened, if you must strain it out; then tie the limb up after the night and the morning, and if you see the oil returning, that is good; if not; continue the dressing and the cloth and the limb and the dressing until it is healed.

When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, then open the joint, and if there are papers within like grains of resin, leave them; for it is expected to see them. If you see them covered, the work is like biting an awl at the root of the lower part until below the middle, then insert another awl or there is a double thread of the lower part; and make it pierce, and leave the first awl as it lies. Then grasp the double thread and bind the upper part of the limb firmly, then pull out the awl and put on lint soaked in oil in abundance; and leave it until the thread is severed with the limb, then cure the oil of comforting things until the wound is healed; and never is the wound restricted by the limb that is under tension by a circle of silk, until it is healed.
And if the wound has great appearance, if you pierce at the soft cartilage which comes from the middle of the oil, and correct the moist vapor and bring down the wound, and put them together; then pull out the awl until it is healed.

After a little rest, if the water returns to the second opening, place the force with the instrument, and when it is firmly secured and does not rise up, gently remove the instrument from the wound slightly bending the limb. Then pour on the water a little bit of the remaining oil, and wipe off the surplus. Then put on clean oil-soaked bandages or linen cloth with plenty of eggs, and tie with the oil.  Indeed, and those who are of our company, put on a warm compress with plenty of eggs.
And if the almagda does not enter the oil because there are too many hairs in the way, since this is the shape of the instrument:
And so, pierce only the conjunctive [ligament] alone, and do not go too deep, but make a small incision, then insert the lancet, as we have said; and when the work is finished, appears to the patient a yawn that comes from the bowels; and let him lie still, and take light meals, and do not move his head to the right or left, and keep him bound according to his disposition until three days; then take him back to the same place where he was before, uncover his eye, and let him see whatever he wishes; then put it back in its place for seven days; and do not let him do anything else until this is finished in the time of treatment or after the incision, but make sure you feed him, for the pain has increased greatly.
And thus, after the incision, comes the discharge of oil from the seventh day; take away the oil before the seventh day and give him what relieves the abscess; and when it is calmed, take away the eye and put upon his face a little bandage to cover nothing; and keep him bound in that place. And then go out of the house and back in, and he will recover in his case; and let no disciple interfere in this matter.
And one came to us from the Yrach region who told us that in their peace they used to do an ointment with honey that when it was applied to the wound, the pain would subside; however, we have never seen or heard of such a thing in our land or in the books of the ancients; and it is a new thing for us.

Sometimes birth or death does not occur with diverse hairs, for there are some which appear like scorpions at the mouth of the teeth; and if there are such or if there is hair entangled with blood of a crimson color, and if there is hair of a sulfurous color. In those in which these hairs are sulfurous, and not entangled, it is enough to make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and cover his nose, and spit out the spittle on those hairs, and drive them away; then take what you can hold to support the subtle gut with one hand, until you know that that hair is entirely bony.
If nothing remains to hold it, if the opening has all its instruments lightly held, if nothing is left; and if without you snoring, or incision close to the eye, if the escape is like it should be; and if it is malignant incisions, hasten and cauterize as much as you can until it is stained and the hair is burned over, then spit or do not spit easily, but with pain or wine.
If he does not vomit, and moisture comes up to the throat, saliva that is sane; and if moisture does not come out like it should, saliva that is there is pus in the bones below, behold the instruments do not come out whole: therefore it must be that you drink a thick thread, and keep your hands clasped, and have between each knot no space more or less; and put the patient’s chin on the thread at the front, and treat with odor until it comes through the nose; and many times do the children do this, and it is a light thing for one who has seen it done; then hold the chief that comes through the nose with one hand, and the other chief that comes through the mouth with the other hand, and take out the one after the other while pressing as we are or with thread. Do this until you are certain that the knot has not corrupted that hair; then draw out the thread, wipe the blood, wet the thread in Egyptian balsam, and put it back in place as before; do this two or three days, until the abscess has corroded all that is left of hair; and then put in or take out a splinter of sponge for some days until it is sane, and if there is need of drying medicines, use them; and this is the form of the instrument for purging the chief, from which we distill oils and medicines or not.
And be it of silver or of gold, like a large lamp, if like a sponge; and guide it thus; and if you see, make a close bundle, and make the instruments flat to purge the chief; and have one hand on the chief to hold it when we burn oil or no liquid.
From the shoulder joint downwards to the wrist.
Many times there arises at the root of the arm a disease which is called “telul,” and it grows and becomes great at once, so that it appears like a thing to behold; and because of this it is expedient that you should commence to apply the cautery or burning medicine at the outset, and break the bone afterwards; and if you delay in covering it when it is great, if you take warning when it is hard, of foul discharge, of bad sense: if you do not touch it with iron, for it is a swollen abscess, for when you touch it once, there results great harm to the patient; and if the abscess is of soft touch, not of foul discharge, you can see that you can cover it all, if you drain the patient and cover it with oil, and cure the limb of dry and restraining things.
when the arm is cut and bound
Wounds that occur when a solution of continuation comes into one of these cartillages works, for in some homes. It is therefore necessary that this does not happen to anyone, if you see that the wound is fresh at all its borders; then join the two edges of the wound together with a stitch, and cure until it is healed. And if the edges of the wound have already separated from one side and the other, if you must keep all the surrounding parts warm until they bleed, then reassemble the two edges of the wound together with a stitch, and strain, and sprinkle upon it some dragon's blood powder and incense; and put upon the powder a piece of dressing of great or other kind that binds. Leave it until it oozes by itself, then cure until it is healed.
The way to stitch is that you reassemble the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the costure of the belly; or with thread, as I have told you.
abscesses of the edges of the wound
At home on the hands there are dense layers of skin, sometimes like grains of wheat, smaller and larger; therefore it is likely that you will tear the skin and make incisions on each little hair, and grasp them with tweezers and pull them out at the root; then employ the paste after the incision of the little carbuncle, until it is no longer stained; and then remove the paste easily, and cure the limb of dry things until it is healed.
Of the teeth of the jaw.
Many times comes upon the gums the white teeth which are called 'albuly'; if you support them, grasp the root and pull out the socket or the blood; then take out the little carbuncle with the vitriole burn or other astringent and drying powders; and if the tooth comes out after the incision, and this happens often, if you grasp it a second time and burn it; if it does not come out after the burn; this is the form of the instruments to cover it
Des sordens.
Once are gathered at the root of the tooth, within the mouth between the gums, teeth that are white and rough; and never are the teeth black and yellow and soft, as long as corruption comes to the gum, and are the teeth biting; if it is that you make the patient sit between your hands, and his shoulder be in your chest, and open the teeth or the gums open, until there remains nothing; and thus make black and green, and yellow and other spots, as long as they are whole; and if one has what is at the first reason, it is good; if not, if he must repeat the second and third time, until you have done everything; and the teeth that have mixed with various forms of instruments to repair, according to what the work shows, for the raisers of the teeth that you must drive out have other forms than those with which you must drive between the teeth; and these forms and others are with you visible.
It is necessary when you cure the tooth of its pain that you do not leave it too long to treat it as much as you wish, for this must not be done carelessly; for it is a high-quality material so therefore we have no excuse for omitting to drive it out When the patient is constrained to do something, if you are certain that he is capable, many times the pain will depart from the patient. Take care that it is neither too great nor too little; and make him do the bone that he wants to do; and although he does not depart from this pain until the malady has disappeared, as we have already done for these scoundrels; and when you are well certain that he is capable, then you must support his tooth firmly for a long time to ward off all harm; then put his thumb and index finger firmly in their place, until they are well secured; and then confirm the fracture well between his thighs, and hold it firmly so that it does not move.
After that, when the tooth is placed directly over the break, and if it does not jump out, take no other instruments and hold the tooth loosely from below; and move it as you did before. And if the pulp is perceived and bruised, if you can, fill it with cloth, or if it is perforated, leave it so; and if the fracture is strongly held with pins, do not break it while holding. You must move smoothly over the gum to extract the tooth.
And take care that you do not break it, and leave some of it, and return to the patient with the greater pain of the first. And take care that you do not do what the ignorant layman do, who break it every time without reason, and do not bring anything but this that we have told you; but bring no bloodshed by the root of this great disease that remains, or by the fracture that they break, as we have often seen; and when the pulp is gone, wash the blood of wine or vinegar and oil; and if there is blood, as it often happens, if you employ the juice of vitriol ground; and if that does not help, cauterize it.
The forms of instruments, when they are mute at first, whether with long points and broad handles, that they do not double much when you draw the tooth; these are the forms:
And be of great limbs if they do not bend much when you draw, and be of iron well made, and be toothed so as to hold them in place.</start_of_turn>
from the root of the tooth.</start_of_turn> When the root is loose when you draw, if you must remove the moist cotton swab inside, namely here or there, until the tooth is loosened, and then insert the forceps that are called “algefri,” so that the head of the tooth seems like a beak; and be made as with a file and that is the form:
And if the roots do not suffice to withstand all these tensions, if you must uncover the flesh entirely around the root, and put in the instrument which is called “althali,” which is to say tweezers, for this is the shape:
And be strong and firm, lest it break my skin, and if the root jumps by this, that is good; if not, aid it with all your instruments, for these shapes will come afterwards.
And if you use this instrument which has teeth, for this is the shape:
And other instruments which are before the teeth, and this instrument which appears like a great clamp, whose form is as follows:
And other instruments which are before the teeth, and this instrument which appears like a great clamp, whose form is as follows: let this instrument be strong enough not to break, and its handles like those of other instruments for teeth; and there are other instruments which are not mentioned here; and the master surgeon will discover by himself his instrument, according to what his works and his experience show, for there are various diseases for which the old methods do not teach any instrument because of their diversity; and if it breaks not from bone or other bones, or if it is crooked, if it seeks other instruments, as I have said, and helps with gestures, as is its form. And let them be large and firm to hold the bone, that it does not slip, but can hold and restrain; and then restore the limb of medicine suitable for this, and if there is decay in the bone, and it is slight, if the grasp has all of these instruments:
When the tooth appears does not match its natural form, and the shape is unsightly, and even in women of gentle birth, if one should think that it is hidden within the tooth, and is not in its rightful place, and one cannot soothe it or support it: then it must be extracted; and if it is foreign to the tooth, if one grasps this instrument which has this shape, which is like a small beak, and is made of iron without a groove at the top:
And it must be grasped firmly and cautiously with the hands just as long as the tooth lasts, and because of that one must not move the others, and if it appears, it can be limed, if one uses a file like this which has the same shape.
And it is just like making nails; and while holding the tooth firmly and cautiously with the hands, if it moves even slightly, if it cries out, the tip should be filed off at the end when it is finished, for if it is too deep it bites the tongue, if one should file away the roughness as much as it is equal, so that it does not bite the tongue or corrupt the speech.
When the teeth are loose.
When the teeth are loose, whether by percussion or biting, and the patient cannot press on what annoys them except by biting, and you must cure them with restrictive medicines, for this is of no avail; if you must restrain them with a gold thread, for the silver thread becomes green and causes pain, but the gums do not move at all; and let the thread be neither too thick nor too thin, according to the quantity of space between the teeth; and if you see that the teeth are too close to each other, take the thread and pass it double between the two front teeth, then place the teeth between the front teeth, if there is one or more of them, until you see them clearly up to the neighboring tooth; then resume the covering until you reach the part where you began, and strain your hand subtly and clearly, so that it does not move; and if your thread is too long at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape. Then clip the teeth with the thread at some tweezers, and assemble them, and put them back between the neighboring teeth, and put them so that they do not touch the tongue; and then leave them so tight as they can remain in place, and if they loosen or the thread breaks, strain with another thread; if it should remain and serve in this way, and this is the form of the teeth and the arrangement of the front teeth and the back teeth, as you see.
And when the tooth bites, if you put it back in its place, fresh from fresh, as we have said; and do not let anything interfere that is not wise and soothing, and never make its form like that of a chipped tooth, and put it back in its place or the default is there, and strain it as we have said, and remain and serve steadily for a long time.
De coper lou liien de la lengue.
The tongue is sometimes loosened from its socket or by nature, or by an accident of a deep wound; and the work is such that you must open the mouth of the patient, put your hand on his tongue, and hold it still; then grasp the large nerve of the tongue, as long as the tongue is displaced from its place, and if there is any delay or not, and it is a matter of healing a wound, if you touch the surrounding area and grasp the nerve firmly; and keep that the incision is not too deep, for the artery which is loosened; and when you have done this, if you lift the pale or cold blood, and put the tongue back in a slight attempt; and bind the patient’s hand, that the tongue cannot move. And if blood comes from the wound, if you pull out the clot; and if it does not go away, if you cauterize with the blunt cautery, which is good for this; then you must cure it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if you see pus of a color or black or hard, if the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is a cancer; and if it is declining to swell, and there is moisture, if it evacuates the clot, and you make a small incision, and deliver from one side and the other; and if it does not go away from your work, if you put on a clot and broil it until it is dry, then come back to your work until you have finished all your work; then lift the pale and thick blood, and cure it with other treatments until it is healed.
Des apostemes de la gorge.
There are often goiter-like swellings in the throat which are called "godath", and which are properly called amandres. And when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, take heed: if they are hard of little size and of a pale colour, do not touch them with iron. And if they are red and the root is large, do not touch them with iron, even though it may cause the loss of blood; but leave them alone until they are dead, and then you may remove them, or they will break by themselves. And if they are of a pale colour and the root is slender, if you have brought the instrument to cover it, look first that the swelling rests and is calmed. Then make the patient sit in front of the sun, and his shoulders should be relaxed, and cover his mouth with his hands, and press the tongue downwards towards the instrument, as it is done; and let it be of silver or gold, just like a nail:

And if you do not have this instrument present, if you have only a pair of tongs, know that this is the form: grasp the one of the nails with one tong, and the other with the other hand; and when you have grasped one nail, grasp the other in the same way, and then make an incision, gargle the patient with hot water, hot and easy, and when the blood has drained, if there are still clots of blood, either break them up with pomegranate seeds, or burn them with bay leaves, or similar things, until the wound is clean; then cure as it is healed; and never again shall there be any other incision in the throat except for the two nails, if you grasp them just as the two nails remain intact.
And I treated a woman with a small abscess in her throat, which was causing her to be unable to breathe through the passage that was obstructed, and unable to eat or drink, and she died because of this. And the abscess was so high that it had forced out two nails from the two holes that had not been pierced. I then held her hand tightly and put one finger on the abscess and the other on the nail, and when I had grasped the nail I made an incision, gargled the patient with hot water, hot and easy, and when the blood had drained, if there were still blood clots, either break them up with pomegranate seeds or burn them with bay leaves, or similar things, until the wound was clean; then I closed the wound and pressed the tongue; after that I put the finger back in the abscess and held one part, and only a little blood escaped from the hole; and when I had finished holding the passage in the throat, the woman was able to drink water and wine, and I continued to examine the abscess for a long time; and the abscess gradually reappeared, filling the cavity that I had evacuated. And I bound and cauterized the abscess within the throat: it went away in a retrograde direction; and I left these parts and only God knows what happened to her after I left.
De l’uve.
When the limb hangs downwards, and it is loosened and becomes long, if it is called a "perpendicular"; and if it is thick and round, if it is called an "uve". When it is cured as we have said in the division, and the cure does not help, and you see that the after-pain has disappeared, and it is subtle, if you must, when you see it, in its color and its length, that you make the patient sit in the sunlight, and press the tongue to the instrument which we mentioned earlier; then close the wound with the needle and thread that we mentioned before. And it must not be closed more than is necessary beyond the natural limit; for if you do, the voice and the tongue will grieve. And after the incision, use what we mentioned in the incision of the two thumbs, and cure until it is healed. And if the patient has fear of the closure, it must be used with the cautery from the side of the fear. And the manner of cautery is acute. And it is that the patient puts his head in his hand, and then presses the tongue to the instrument which we mentioned or the chapter of cautery, and grasp with live charcoal, if it is not too thick or too thin; and use the handle of this instrument, from which it is known.

And it is that the patient puts his head in his hand, and then presses the tongue to the instrument which we mentioned or the chapter of cautery, and grasp with live charcoal, if it is not too thick or too thin; and use the handle of this instrument, from which it is known.
This cure is safer than incision, for the cautery; if it is cured by fumigation as described in this manner, take charcoal and isops and origanum and rue and chamomile and avronne and similar herbs, and gather all of them together in one pot, and put them in, and boil; and the pot should be well glued with strong earth, and in the middle of the pot put one instrument with a handle as described in this manner: This cure is safer than incision, for the cautery; if it is cured by fumigation as described in this manner, take charcoal and isops and origanum and rue and chamomile and avronne and similar herbs, and gather all of them together in one pot, and put them in, and boil; and the pot should be well glued with strong earth, and in the middle of the pot put one instrument with a handle as described in this manner:
Many times it has happened to me at the throat bone or fish spine, or nothing; so therefore it is right that you should know what you see, and press the tongue to the sun with all the instrument, so that you see the thing; and what does not appear to you and is returned to the throat, do make the patient vomit the illness as soon as the meat is cooked in the stomach; in case it is expelled by vomiting; or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or some piece of dry bread; and tie the sponge to one thread, and then transfix it; and when it comes back, if it is expelled, and then draw it out; and if it does not come out of what we have said, take one instrument of sponge as described above:
And let the instrument curve at the head if it can enter more easily through the neck, with the head raised up; and guard that you do not touch the epiglottis, for it will not go down, nor will you push the bone inwards; and must you value that the patient has come to take the instrument, for it is either stiff or something is wrong; if the epiglottis is swallowed, or if you force it down with all the instrument equally, as much as it is forced.
And let the instrument curve at the head if it can enter more easily through the neck, with the head raised up; and guard that you do not touch the epiglottis, for it will not go down, nor will you push the bone inwards; and must you value that the patient has come to take the instrument, for it is either stiff or something is wrong; if the epiglottis is swallowed, or if you force it down with all the instrument equally, as much as it is forced.
And never is medicine good, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when that does not help, then look at the patient’s tongue in the sunlight, and when you have pressed the tongue against the instrument that I have told you of. And if you see the tongue, if you force it down with all your might, or if there are tenacles that are worth as much. And if that is not worth it, if you take a toothache, and put it in the patient’s throat, and withdraw or bite the tooth – or burn with the cautery – do that often. And if the patient suffers with great pain, then take a full drink of cold water, and cover the mouth, and swallow, and move the tongue with your hand often; and if you see that with the tongue the patient feels the pain, withdraw it.
And if it does not yield as we have said, if you fumigate the patient with asafoetida, using the instrument that I have mentioned in the fumigation of the eye; do this many times, for it will have its effect. And the manner of fumigation is that you take one pot or there are charcoal pieces visible, and let the pot cover be covered with a gauze patch in the middle, and in that hole let the instrument be; then you pour your fumigation, and the patient puts the head of the cane in his mouth, closes his mouth, so that the smoke does not go out, but comes out only through the opening; and the opening will now yield, and if it does not yield, repeat the fumigation many times; and the patient will suffer thirst, eat dirty and foul things, and do not drink water; and thus it will force him that it goes out by this government.
And the shape of the instrument is like that which we treat the boils with, if indeed when we see it, it is like a pair of tongs with teeth to enter the throat; and it has the shape of a beak of a heron, and it has a lime-like roughness, so that whatever it grasps, it cannot let go; and thus is the shape.
The chapters on abscesses.
The wounds of the abscess are diverse in their perforation and size; for there are two ways in which they may be classified. The first is when the wound resembles itself, and when it has moisture. The second is when the wound is on the bone or is at the joint. For the wound of the head of the abscess is different from that of the wound of the root, and the wound of the bone of the arm is different from that which is in the joints.
If the abscess does not burst by itself, as long as it is painful according to its degree; but if it is of such a kind that it must be burst when it is hardened, and does not die according to its degree, as is the case of abscesses that are drained from joints. For when an abscess is drained from a joint, and it is left in its place, by chance if the tendon and nerve of the joint are ruptured, which is the cause of stiffness in that limb. Or if the abscess is drained from the principal part of the limb, and the perforation is delayed until it is complete, if there is a wound of the principle part; or if it is drained from the root, if the perforation is not complete; you must only pierce the abscess when it is hardened with digestion accompanying, except for the one that is drained from the root, which must be left uninjured, and must be drawn inwards, and there will be fistula; and it cannot heal in a great amount of time.
You must cauterize the wound of the abscess when it is painful according to its degree; when the pain is calmed, the swelling has gone down, the fever has gone down, the swelling and redness have gone down, there is no debate or tingling in the head of the abscess, and other signs; and you must make the perforation or more dependent on the abscess, and the place where the pus comes out; and let the perforation be long enough, if the abscess is full of hands or feet, or in joints and nerves and arteries, and in all parts that are equal or there is no pus.
When the wound bursts open, by the will of the limb itself. And when the abscess is settled, if you leave the perforation open until it is confirmed in digestion, as we have said. For if you pierce it before that, if it has been a while, the poison will spread through it, and there will be plenty of filth; and by chance you will strengthen the wounds and deepen them. And if there is no abscess that is perceived according to the large size of the limb, according to what the limb has suffered. And it is obvious that you must bring in small abscesses, small perforations; and in large abscesses, large perforations, and many incisions according to the size of the abscess; and if there are such abscesses that you must chew through to the marrow, cover them; when it is already burst like a drape, and is softened, if you must do the same as with bubbles. And if there are such ones that are split into two angles, and such ones as we cope with the nutmeg, like abscesses of the spleen; and if there are such ones that we make a round size, and others of a similar nature that are coped with.
When there is no head of the sufferer, if there is a superficial abscess, it is obvious that you must pierce it straight through; and when the abscess is large, and it has a great swelling, and you pierce it, if you do not drain all the swelling at that time, but only a part; then stamp the abscess until the other side, and leave nothing more. Do this repeatedly until the swelling is all gone; even if the patient has little strength, or a woman in labor, or a young child, or an old man decrepit. For experience has never shown that there is any success with the discharge of the swelling, except by chance the patient dies, and you will not be blamed for it. Therefore, escape from this chapter with great caution, and when you have perceived your abscess, if you wipe the wound, look to see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is of a moderate size, bring in some lint or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there is plenty of perforation, it is obvious that you must drink in chews one attempt after the other until they meet in the middle; and if you have cut a piece of skin out of the abscess and closed it, if you must, cover it with fine cotton or a sliver of flaxseed soaked in moisture, and leave it for a third of the way; then the bone, and bandage it until it is healed.
And if there are discharges of blood in your work, if you bring in cold and sharp water and soak it for a while, and take out the offending dressing many times. And if the discharge of blood persists, if you bring in government and cure, and the powders that I have said in my hands in this book, and if it is winter and the limb or the abscess is numb, it is obvious that you must put on attempts and soaked cloths with wine and oil; and if it is summer, and the limb is fleshy, it is obvious that you must put on soaked cloths with water and oil, or with wine and oil that has been rubbed, until the third of the way; and then take out the abscess and wipe and bandage it, if it is possible, until it is healed.
And this must be known throughout in the treatment of abscesses: when you say how one must alert before treating abscesses, and when the physician is aware of this chapter.

And this must be known throughout in the treatment of abscesses: when you say how one must alert before treating abscesses, and when the physician is aware of this chapter. Or as I have said before, when there are small abscesses that are like nails or seeds; and when there is moisture like in poulps; and if there are hard and rough ones at the root, and no doubt exists if the vein is not opposed. And the work of this size is such that you must expect every instrument called an “entromissoire,” for which the form comes afterwards, what it contains. For if it contains moisture, it must be discharged by pressure of a long time. And when the moisture is discharged, do not leave the peel that contains that moisture, because it returns to its place when you leave it alone; then put on cotton wool in Egyptian fashion, if it is present; if not, in water and oil, and apply the bandage, and leave it until the other side; and this will remedy what is remaining that is delayed. And since you have put on the cotton wool again, as before, the second side, and the third, until you are certain that it does not remain delayed; then cure the wound according to what is appropriate, until it is healed. And if the abscess persists without any fat, if the bump conforms to this form, of a long size; and it gushes out your nails, and evacuates all parts, and put all your care into pulling out the clot or where it is located; and if the vein opposes you, do as I have said afterwards. And in the same way make an abscess if it is rough, and at the root and cure it as I have said.
And the size above the pierced vein and the moisture, if it is less severe, because they are of little blood. And if some of these veins or arteries or there is no moisture, and these are the veins that I cauterize or tie up with an old woman; and I find the vein just like a hardened stone, rough and pale, and cannot break it. And if no blood comes out, we would do just as well to make a wound like a stone. In other veins coming or arteries, because these come from the head of the children and have roots of the ears, they open if they are at all dependent on the limb, for the pulse is stiff; and they cure as they should.

Many times happen these carbuncles at the collarbone, and the armpits, and the flanks, and never anywhere else or on the body, and are black, and are joined together. And a true carbuncle is properly contained within its sheath, if like the root of a tooth and the carbuncle is round, as we have said; and the signs of these carbuncles are many. There are some that contain moisture, and if there are malignancies which do not obey health. In those in which you see a good arrangement to the toucher, and is similar in color to bone, and is soft from one side and is not hollow like the bone of the collar or the artery or the vein, and is not deep; if you should cauterize it, and scorch the soft part, and extend the two thumbs as we have said in the carbuncles of the chief; and then pull back and forth, and be sure that you do not burn the nerve or the vein, and do not cause too much swelling or bruising, that the hands do not escape, and do not voice too soon, that you do not cauterize anything that you do not have to.
If you grasp the vein or artery, and this hinders your work, if you put in the wound a piece of vitriol broth, or some powders which remain in the wound, and constrain the wound; and leave it until the swelling subsides, and soften the wound, and commence to move. And when the swelling is gone, if you return to your work, until you have completed it; then if there remain no small scabs, if you grasp and pull them out. And if there is in the root of the scab a large vein, if you do not grasp only that scab in its root, but bind it with a strong double thread, and leave it hanging freely; then apply the wound dressing in the Egyptian fashion, and cure.
If you grasp the whole scab, if you can assemble the four limbs of the wound and suture them now, and there is no longer any swelling from the greatness of the scab. If you can understand to grasp the root of it, and tear outwards, and suture as we have said. Those scabs which hold swelling, pierce them through or they will open death; and pierce just as the one we said before, depending on the case. And bring together threads with oil and similar things, so that it removes what is remaining of the corruption; and when the wound is well drained, if the dressing of oil covers the scar, while it is sound.
When the wound is well drained, if the dressing of oil covers the scar, while it is sound.
The old men spoke of the size of the throat; but I have never seen it done in our land, and this is the writing of their words.
As for those who have a squinance, it is necessary that the flap of the throat which is called the epiglottis be freed; and this will not help, for all the veins and the blood vessels of the patient are at those who have placed their trust in it in the mouth, or in the throat or in the tonsils.</start_of_turn> When the disease is in the channel of the blood vessels, it is necessary to cover the epiglottis to prevent the loss that comes from the strangulation.</start_of_turn
It is appropriate to withhold translation until the complete text has been provided.
When the tonsils are split open, it is advisable in this section of the epiglottis that there be no cartilage, and the blood vessels are long and wide open.</start_of_turn>
And if the master is hesitant, it is advisable that he stretch the skin of the throat to the utmost extent, then cut the skin as far as the chin; and avoid the blood vessels of the tongue, if you see nothing, and then cut the tonsil, as we have said.</start_of_turn
And it is demonstrated by the swelling of the cheek which leaps up by the broken bone, and by the loss of voice.
And leaves the wound open for a piece.
And when the hour has passed and there is still doubt about the strangulation, assemble the four limbs of the wound together, and bind them all firmly with the cartilage; then administer medicines that promote healing, until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
The abscess does not cease until the throat is completely swollen, and the patient is judged dead, and the flaw is left behind.</start_of_turn Therefore, keep your epiglottis shut for this reason, that the patient cannot swallow, and he breathes through the wound; thus is he guarded from death.
Therefore, the old man must be commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease has passed, and it is passed in two or three days. And thus they must command to sew up the wound and cure, until it is cured;
and I will tell you what I have seen. I saw that a woman took a knife and stuck it in her throat, and swallowed part of her windpipe;
I saw that a woman took a knife and stuck it in her throat, and swallowed part of her windpipe; and I ran to call for help, and found her just like death.
I discovered the wound, and found the blood that was coming from it, and saw that it did not reach any vein or artery except for the throat, and that it was coming from the wound itself.
I hastened, and closed the wound, and cured it until it was healed;
And it did not happen to the dame that she lost her voice, and she returned afterwards to her usual state.
For indeed, in the structure of the epiglottis, I do not find any fear.
of the great throat.
These abscesses are called "laryngeal hernias" and are large abscesses of a yellowish color, and are very common in women;
It is in accordance with two methods: nature itself, and the accident; for the natural thing has no concern.
And the accidental is in two ways: as one is like grease to us, and the other way is like an incision which comes from an artery. There is doubt, and one must not work with fire except in this little thing, and one must prove and search for everything that is inside: If you find it thus as though of no grease, and do not touch any vein, if the head is fractured, as we fracture the bone, and do so with all its covering, if there is none; And encircle all around, and cure it as it should be, until it is perfectly healed.
And encircle all around, and cure it as it should be, until it is perfectly healed.
Many methods exist for us, of which I shall speak of all.
and it is necessary that I tell you all the difference between our methods.
I say that the cause of dislocation is heat and fever that lasts as long as the inflammation persists, and is accompanied by swelling; therefore let the fever and heat rest.
Without any new heat or fever or pain, and with swelling, there is a sac which is its own, and which is like the color of gold, and starts like wax, and becomes large
and looks like fat, oil, or moisture, and the color is like I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the cure of the knot, to ask and inquire first about all the instruments which are called "entromissaires," according to their form or chapter which follows.
And as for the investigation of abscesses of the groin, you take a greater quantity of moisture than you find in the abscess, and rotate your thumbs and index fingers, until you sense that the instrument has grasped the hair; then do so in accordance with the size of the abscess.
Then draw out the intestines, and take care that the urine tube does not burst.</start_of_turn>
When moisture comes in contact with the skin, it colors it; if it is like this as I have said of other abscesses;
If after the introduction of the medicament, no moisture comes, and the saeches are greasy, if you do not then make the sign of the cross, take hold of the limb, and slightly stretch it from the elbow part towards the wrist, holding the coat where you would normally handle it with the thumb.
If you do not manage to handle it properly, if you tear it piece by piece, so that nothing remains.
For if nothing remains, it will return to us many times;
And if it lingers a little while, without causing you concern, if you employ a wound cautery of some sharp corrosive powders, restrain the wound and apply soothing things around it; then cure it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if it is great, if cut the two fingers of the wound, and cure it of that which engenders pain.
And if the vein is beating contrary to you or another if you are in a hurry and employ the juice of vitriol ground, and leave it for two or three days, until the wound has healed, and rest the swelling of blood; then return to cover what has remained delayed from before
See here the forms of the introverted instruments, and there are three kinds: great, medium, and small; and there are four squares that are called "albaret," and one that is called "breb," and there are three kinds: great, medium, and small, to surround the fistulas.
They are like nails with which the surgeons sew up wounds, and are made of gold, or iron, or silver, and often of yellow copper, and are more experienced with black pitch to surround the fistulas.
And there are three kinds: great, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the size of the wound.
The forms of boils are like clusters of seeds, as you see here: large, medium, and small; and if boils have two curves of two manners in the same place.
The forms of boils are like clusters of seeds, as you see here: large, medium, and small; and if boils have two curves of two manners in the same place. And if boils have two curves and are of two manners; and if boils have one curve only and are of two manners; all these are necessary in their place.
The chief of these boils are trenchant, and there are some that do not tear much more than one side, from which we must support the limb, for otherwise we cannot close the vein or the nerve.
And among these interferences are the bones returned to their sockets, so that the patient does not lose them through the incisions.
And there are three kinds: great, small, and medium, as you see.
And one should use them only on bone that is firmly fixed, such as the leg, arm, shoulder, ankle, and similar things; and in similar wounds.
And never make another small instrument like little fists, like these forms, which cause bleeding:
And one must never put it back in the same place where it has already grasped the veins, and arteries, never again in such a great form.
Never put it back in the same place where it has already grasped the veins and arteries, never again in such a great form.
and remain limp and soft, and anyone who sees them cured, if they believe it is possible to cure them according to this form up to this line b. until g.: then scrape away the fat, and use the medical plaster thickly applying pressure, then join the two ends of the wound with stitches, and cure until it is healed;
And if the breast leans forward and is eased by its greatness as with women, if the force is in two ribs below, by two similar fissures; or if one holds the other at the end of both, so that the greater line contains the smaller one as in this shape, from this line B up to line G.</start_of_turn> then scrape the skin between the two ribs, and remove the fat, and mix in what we have said of sutures and powders, and anything else necessary for the cure, as long as it is healthy.</start_of_turn>
and if it is not healthy, or the incision is not completely done, because the patient does not want to rest, or for the discharge of blood, if you must, fill the wound with soft cotton in corrosive order. And let him leave them [hairs] as long as they manage the remaining fat and grease; then cure them when they are healthy.
As for the incisions of the armpits, abscesses, wounds, and extraction of arrows, and cutting into stones, there are often evacuations of blood in these operations; and where there is doubt and fear, many die.
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated from moisture, and is reset but does not stay in place, it dislocates repeatedly with the slightest movement, as we have seen; therefore one must first reset the dislocation.
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. When all the blood in the abscess has drained away, if you employ a wound closure of thick cotton wool, leave it in place until the other side has healed, then remove the cotton wool completely, and cure the wound that has resulted from this until it is healed.
And if the abscess has the appearance of carbuncles, if it is like what we have said concerning incisions of carbuncles, and if the wound has bled, if necessary perform cautery as we have previously stated.</start_of_turn>
of the route of the artery
When an artery is blocked, and the skin above is swollen, if there are many abscesses as a result, there will also be swelling of the vein and abscesses.
and if the vein is obstructed in this way, when the abscesses are long and prominent, they press down upon it.</start_of_turn> and when you feel it in your arm, if you feel it in this way, that is an extrusion; and when it is in the vein, it is a running away of the blood.</start_of_turn
It is foolish to cover this abscess, and in the same way as when it is swollen with pus and abscesses, and boils and wounds and in the mouth of other things, and it is great.</start_of_turn> It is appropriate to eschew the iron cure, and he who is at the head should eschew also, and in that one who has a swelling of an artery is made by that above the leather long.
It is appropriate to eschew the iron cure, and he who is at the head should eschew also, and in that one who has a swelling of an artery is made by that above the leather long. then remove the size as one would unhooks, and depart well the artery from the tissues, until it is uncovered;
then hold it with an awl, and pierce it through to the other side, and strain the artery with a double thread in this way, as I have taught you in the extraction of the arteries in the temples;
then point the loop which is between the two links of an introspecter as much as without causing it to bleed, and be delivered from the abscess;
Then order the treatment that soothes the wound, as long as the limb cries out; Then order the treatment that stops the bleeding that comes with this, as long as it is still bleeding;
and if the wound is large enough to reach the bone, if you must hold your hand over the wound from the outside.</start_of_turn> Then grasp the needle with your hand and pierce it through the skin, and there should be two threads, so that you can pull it out from the other side; Then hold the abscess steady, as I have said, or ligate one of the two parts with two hairs.
If you doubt that the thread will pierce further, if it recoils another awl at every thread of the same length as the first, hold the thread firmly for three days.</start_of_turn>
Then drain the abscess until it stops flowing, then drain the pus from the wound and leave what is bound over;
Then put on a moist bandage soaked in wine and oil, and apply cures of stitches and ointments until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Des apostemes des ners.
The fire cautery instructs the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation.
The following text is a medieval medical treatise written in Old French, around the 12th-13th centuries.
And remains silent from all sides, neither going forward nor backward, neither to the left nor to the right, and he who is in the joints cannot be covered by iron: by chance, contraction will result.
And he who is at the head or the chief or the front, makes the skin taut over the bone. If the abscess is small, if the patient has some nails, and he grasps it at its root;
If it is large, if the swelling has reached the bone, and it is softened, then one must break the bone and unite the wound together, and one must cure until it is healed.
From the armpits downwards. Never before have I seen such a thing in the belly and not elsewhere, and it is a disease which is called "fungus" because of its resemblance to nails, and its root is subtle, and its head is large; and there are many small and great spots in it.</start_of_turn>
and I have seen two homes where there were two or more of these in the belly which were more like nails than anything else, and there was no difference between them, and they were white, and had a thick root, and were split open, and discharged moisture.</start_of_turn
I cured them both and found that in one case there were 16 ounces and in the other 9, and the works in the incision are such that if you look at the patient you can see if they are moist, and the color of the blood is pale and moist and has a thick root;
If the shoulder blade is large and prominent, and you are in my presence, perform the fire cautery. For in this case there often ensues great bleeding, and if it does not stop, hasten then and perform the cautery.
If you see the patient shivering and pale from the incision, take one thread of silk well made, and tie the artery as we have said, and leave it for three days.
Then bind the limb, and do not cease to compress the thread until the artery is closed, and ask him to work by himself; and if the roots are black, if there is fear in the middle for the belly, but you must cover half of it well,
Then cauterize until it does not return; then cure the wound and keep only the hair that is of dark colour and poor sense and milk-stained.
For indeed it is an inflamed abscess, and I will come to the treatment of the abscess later.</start_of_turn>
When the boil is fierce.</start_of_turn
When a boil appears, it comes from a wound burn or incision, and is on the belly and there are some pus, as there is in other parts, or blood that clots veins or arteries according to what is in front, or swelling;
If by the route of the jaw and the escape of the bowel, if the color of the wound resembles that of the corn, and is a slight matter causing pain, and has various discharges. If by the escape of the intestine, then it is more diverse; and when one presses it there, if it returns and then recurs, and by chance if it is closed, and brings about great swelling at the entrance of the bath and much work.
If by moisture, it is a slight matter; and opens well when you press it with your hand, do not constrain me; and if by blood, if it opens with these signs the wound is great and hard, and is closed according to the quantity.
If it is by wind pressure, if the toucher suspects it, and if work is done to see if the appearance is by the blood of an artery or a vein, or by wind pressure. If you leave the cure. For there is doubt and fear, as I have said or as in the case of an abscess, concerning the artery or the vein.</start_of_turn>
And if the appearance is by the intestine or the bowel, if you command the patient to hold his breath, and be prolonged in a straight line, then mark it around the belly.</start_of_turn Then he commands you to manage the pain between your hands, then go around the limb that you have signed to the whole circumference, then hold the other half of the circumference at the top to the whole great curve;
Then over half of the abscess is extended over the vein, and there you must place your index finger and the intestine; If you find it caught in the vein, if you pull it out, and place the intestine against the swelling of the belly.
and if you find pus, if you grasp it with forceps, and drain the excess.
and if the artery or the vein is injured, if it has gone black, then return to your work and take three nails, and take three files, and pierce through those things which you have made that you think you have pierced through;
Then strain the abscess for four days on the needles; if you see them, break the needles and leave the abscess alone until it bursts by itself; kill the pain by itself. or you must pierce it when it is small and soft, then cure it of what is causing it, and leave the abscess as we have said;
or you must pierce it when it is small and soft, then cure it of what is causing it, and leave the abscess as we have said; extract the blood or moisture that you find, then cure the limb of what is causing it, and bandage the limb.
sore abscess
We have already spoken of the signs of an abscess, and how it should be treated with medicines, and how to shun the cautery. We say that an abscess swells in the marrow, and has great caution in its treatment. The old men say that when an abscess is in the flesh or can be scraped out like an abscess which is in marrow, and in the heel, and in other parts, it must be extirpated as soon as possible; and when it is large and old, if it cannot be brought about, do not approach it, for I know of no cure for it. None of them has ever cured it before me.
And in the work, when it is in the flesh or can be extirpated, as we have said, do not purge the black bile from the patient once. Then make the patient well again if there is any visible swelling. Then give the patient a purgative, such as wine, to make the work easier. Then take out the nails or abscesses, and the sinews of all parts, and the bone of all parts round about; and leave the wound to heal naturally. Expect the wound to bleed at the incision of the artery or vein if the cautery is done too much; then cure with another remedy until it is healed.

We have already mentioned in the division the signs of dropsy, and how the gathering of water is made, and the signs of swelling resemble, and the cure which is made by medicines, and that which is cured by iron: if only the inflammation is alight; and one must not touch iron in these two signs: that is to say, tympanites and yposarche, for it is a deadly thing. Therefore when one administers medicine for this sign which is called "inflammation" by medicine, and the cure brings no benefit, if one observes that the patient is weak, or if there is another disease besides dropsy, as with all other diseases and like many other things; if one does not touch iron, for there is doubt; and if one sees the patient of great strength, and there is only dropsy besides, and he is neither too young nor too old, then one must work on him. Hold the patient’s right hand over your hands, and press the abdomen downwards towards the lower part of the belly, then take the thumb and index finger and shape them like this: Make a trench about two fingers wide at the tip, and do not make it so deep that it reaches the intestines when you insert it, and do not bind it.
Then look if dropsy is reaching the intestines: if you think that two fingers’ breadth of fluid has gone into the bowels, make two transverse incisions above the navel; and if the dropsy is caused by liver disease, make the incision on the left side of the belly; and if it is caused by gravel, make it on the right side, and do not make the incision too deep that the fluid runs out of the weak limb.
Then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and the gut, and hold your hand with all the space between the skin and the bone as when escorting the amount of a nail or an arrowhead; then pierce the bone as far as the space comes to an end, and that is the cause of the pain, then pull out the instrument, and there is left the form of the instrument: and it is similar to a silver awl, and is of steel or an archangel’s wing, and has at the lower part a small hole; or costs two holes, and three on one side, and one on the other; and the nail is cut like a pen, and that is the form of the incision which the writer cuts like a pen.
At the head of this is the ailment, so that when the instruments come to the pain, if you now lift them up from the instruments; drain then half or a third part, for if you drain more than that which can be contained in that hour, by chance the patient will die from the resolution of his spirit from the weapon, or he will vomit, or he will approach death.
but drain according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the virtue tell the patient, and his pulses; then pull out the instrument and hold back the pain, and it is now retained by the thumb which is pressing the perforation which is on the bone, as I have said, that you pierce in this manner; then repeat the instrument the other way, if you see the patient suffering from that, and pull out a small amount of pain.
Fai ce aucun jor, et te garde de suivre tant qu’il ne reste plus qu’un peu d’eau. Et si tu douteras sur le patient, et tu y laisse mourir du eau, si le recrute de la sepulture ou du sable chaud, et par mourir de sueur ou de bain et au soleil, et se teigne de boire; et le recrute de médicaments dessicantes tant qu’il soit sain, et cauterise sur l’estomac et sur le foie et sur l’esplen après l’extraction de l’eau, comme j’ai dit précédemment.
Do nothing foolish, and keep following until there remains only a little water left. And if you doubt the patient, and you let him drink too much water, if the recruit of the sepulture or the warm sand, and by sweating or bathing and in the sun, and take care to drink; and the recruit of drying medicines until he is well, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before. Never is a child born without a hernia in the belly, or the hernia is small, or it is not firm in its place. If you suspect too much that there is no hernia at all, do not attempt to pierce anything. If you wish to do so, take a little piece of lead or plum pudding and bind it and hold it in place for two or three days. And when he wants to urinate, if you keep the closure closed, he will urinate, and then you can release it; and by chance there will be no harm, for the urine that comes out will not leave the closure closed. If the opening is small, if it is a medicine of lead weight, as we have said, if it expands. Those who have no opening in their limb are black, for none are born with the opening at the head of the bone, for they cannot urinate before raising their thigh; and they cannot evacuate anything because the matter cannot come down to the marrow, and this is an evil disease.
And the method of this work is that if the patient lies supine on his back, and the head of the thigh and the hip are as wide as a thumb, if the opening is in the middle, as it should be; and you must take care of the evacuation of blood which comes many times, and if it comes, if the stain of this which stains blood, and cure the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
of the thigh Many times this white spot appears on the verge, and is a sign of a harmful disease; and in it there are both malignant and benign things. If you take them at their face value [literally "with oil of oncion"], grasp and crush them all, then put on moist cotton in Egyptian fashion; then treat with diafinicon until it is healed. And if the spot is malignant, with colour and discharge, if you must treat it with cautery. When you have grasped it, and if the spot is on the edge of the verge and some is in the hair and some outside, if you must stretch the spot which is inside first; and when it is fractured, if you cure the outside, if you do not firmly secure the edge of the verge that it is not perceived, comes blackening and corruption in the verge or groin; if you must remove all that is black and corrupted, then apply honey and flour made from pomegranate peel and sometimes, then treat with other treatments until it is healed.
And if blood comes out, if you must apply the lunar cautery as follows: The cautery should be as follows: at the discharge of blood and at the corruption; and if the head of the shoulder is corrupted and retracted, if you drink or lead the patient away from the verge a bundle of wool, and the patient urinates; and when the hair has dried out from the head of the verge which have not been circumcised, or there is wound or incision, if you must then burn them with a burning instrument until the limb is loosened, and deliver the limb from all parts.
If it is an urgent matter to separate this, if you can, grasp it immediately without causing any harm to the head of the thigh or the heel; then slowly separate between the thumbs, and put a wet linen bandage on it with cold water, so that it does not slip out of place.

Circumcision is not merely an act of continuing care like other wounds; however, when we perform this work of our own will, and properly as possible, if it is necessary that we make it as mild as possible for the patient.
I say that the ancients did not teach me circumcision of the children, for they did not use it in their law, and we have learned only what we have learned through experience.
For I have seen that the greatest part of masters and doctors who practiced circumcision did so without knowledge, with force, and with a new instrument; if it happened that the testicles escaped because of two layers of skin, and by chance if one cut through these and left the other behind
Or it returns covered, and the pain is doubled, and there is the mutilation which is more than doubtful concerning the tip of the limb; and the mutilation of the bone by chance escapes the wound, and repairs the work, and many times happens that they must undergo mutilation without having had to do so, and I have seen it.
From the modification which is made with force throughout the thread I have found the benefit of the experiment, for the forces tear just as well downwards as upwards.
For when you press your hand, if it is held equally in every way, there is great tension; but if the thread is well twisted around the leather; and if the manner be as at first work, if you make the child think, if he understands, do not make him suffer more than to bind the thread around the limb only as much as is necessary, and then let him go in all the ways that you wish. Then put your hand between your hands straight, and bring the forces between your hands or from your pieces that the child will not see, no instrument; then stretch your hand at the limb and breathe or cough, and pull up as much as the head of the limb is set; then wipe away the dirt that is gathered, then bind the sign with a double thread, then bind from this side to that side as much as is necessary; and hold for two seconds at the pouch and the index finger, and press between the two lines, then release the thumb immediately and pull out the chief of the limb.

Then let the blood drain freely without restraint, for this is the wisest; and sprinkle powder on and about the wound. i.e. a bandage stuck with a yolk of egg moistened with rose oil and balsam, and leave it on until the bleeding stops.
When the limb is deformed in this way: the two bones are tense and bent, and the limb is as thick as a sleeve,
The error of deformation is when the marrow is fractured during the incision; therefore it is necessary to stretch your nail so that the wound is open; and cut equally, and if you cannot hold your nail firmly, even if you grasp it tightly, and then cut.</start_of_turn>
If they trespass for two days, and that which is from the root is swollen, if you leave it as long as the spasms subside, and the swelling is slight; if you press it as you can, and hold on to the root, it will avail you nothing.
If you press too much over and above measure, and it goes away, it will avail you nothing; cure it as we have said, while it is still sound.</start_of_turn>
because of the retention of urine.</start_of_turn>
The retention of urine is from the opilation of a stone, or of blood congealed, or of bile, or of chyle, or similar things, which we have mentioned in the previous division.
If the urine does not flow freely, and you see that the stone is in the kidney or the neck of the bladder, if it is necessary, you must bend the patient over their knees; place the hand pieces outside the back, and extend the patient's abdomen from the upper part of their back, and restrain the patient so that they do not move as much as possible; and then you must force the neck of the bladder out to the outlet of the stone, so that the urine will flow out immediately.
If it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, if it is necessary, you must administer an extraction with all the instruments which are called "siringues"; for this is the form: either of silver with a slight groove cut, like the beak of a bird; or the caine of a long and a half palm, or something similar to that.
And thus the manner of issuing urine is that you take one double thread and bind one end to a piece of wool or cotton, and pass the end through the syringe; and drain the surplus of wool and pass until you reach the end of the syringe, then join the syringe with oil or butter and vinegar of egg, and make the patient sit on one seat, and raise the bladder and the belly with oil moist and olive oil and warm water.
Then put the syringe gently into the bladder until it reaches the root of the bladder, and double the bladder downwards towards the buttocks; then drain the syringe until it reaches the bladder, and feel the patient urinate until it is empty, for this is not done except in this order save for that which is driven or which goes crooked; then withdraw the thread from all the wool and wool, and the urine follows the thread, and then draw it out, and correct the urine.
And resume the syringe until the bladder is empty, and make the patient align.
Des maladies de la vessie.
When there are urine stones or blood in the bladder, or if it is filled with pus, and you see urine and medicines boiling, if you do everything that is called a «clepsedre», which is its shape:
It is closed, and if it is pierced at two places: one at the beginning and one at the end, as you see; and you must keep the bladder steady so that the medicine is properly absorbed, if we can drive out the moisture, and evacuate as much as possible is necessary.
And when you see your medicines flowing in the bladder, put the head of the catheter into the moisture, and pull out the catheter little by little; if you pull out the moisture at the catheter, and then push it back in strongly; if the moisture enters the catheter, and comes to the bladder now, if the patient feels it
And this is the form of the subtle blister from which we clip the bladder: if it be thus:
And this is the form of the subtle blister from which we clip the bladder: if it be thus:
And if you do not have a bladder, if you take a piece of parchment, and make a circle, and pierce it round; then stretch a strong thread through these holes, and assemble the circle as if you were assembling a ball, and put inside what you see of oil and moisture and water, and bind it with the instrument; and do as you did with the bladder, pressing your hand until the moisture comes to the bladder.
From the stone.
We have already mentioned above the methods of handling stones, and their extraction with medicines; and we have spoken of the difference between a stone that is embedded as rain and all the signs, and in what case a stone must be opened according to its size; and in the bladder, and the kidney; and I shall tell you openly and briefly about them.</start_of_turn>
I say that the stone which is embedded in the bladder is oftener loose, and this is a sign that it has burst from the bladder as much as from its subtlety; and it opens gravel, and grinds the patient’s flank, and causes them to urinate frequently, and then becomes hardened; and from these bursts there is always some sediment; and the foundation is easily loosened for about three years, and is more grievous in the old, and is as common in youths as in old people; and the cure is easier for those who have a large stone than for those who have a small one.</start_of_turn
And when we come to the treatment, if it is necessary first to loosen the patient by clinking, to drive out all the pain that is in the intestines. For it never fails to obstruct the stone.
Then take the patient by the limbs, and loosen and move downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder; and it never fails to go down without some movement upwards; then make him sit between your hands apparent, and his hands be placed against his thighs, so that the bladder is totally relaxed downwards; then ask and touch accordingly.</start_of_turn>
If you feel the stone in the space, if you hurry up now to touch the stone on the stone. And if it does not prick at being touched all around, if you feel more oil from your left hand, if the patient is fat, or from your middle finger, if the patient is young and robust; then press on its foundation, and ask for the stone, and when you feel it with your middle finger, if the bladder is full; then press on your middle finger, and the stone will come out either by itself or you will see it spit out.</start_of_turn>
And instruct the minister to press the bladder with his hand, and command him to extend with his right hand the hairs above, and with his left hand grasp the skin that is below the hairs in the part where the size is taken; then insert the sponge with a clap, for thus is its form.
And place between these hairs and the foundation, do not make them go into the middle but along the left side of the nail; and be upright on the stone, and your two thumbs either downwards or towards the foundation, and take the size through if it is wide by pushing, but inside narrow, according to the quantity of the stone, do not make it too large.
By chance the press if two thumbs are on the stone or the foundation, that it press forward in the work; and the nails that are in the piece or that are angled, and margins: if they are grasped to be stiff; and if there is a piece that is soft, it is like a gland, round, from which there is little issue.
If there are angles or margins, make the size larger; and if it does not slip, it is certain that you must draw upon the tenacles which are as sharp as a file at the head, to draw out the stone if it does not escape; or you can give it an emetic, i.e. a mild instrument with a curved handle at the head; if you do not manage to engage it, it is large and will pierce, and if it is without decor, it is like straining with vitriol.
If there are more than one stone, first draw out the largest at the neck of the bladder, then draw up, then push out, and the smaller afterwards if there are more. And if it is very large, if you cover it with silk, make a larger wound. For indeed, many things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine comes back towards him more abundantly than it can be bound; but whatever you do, try to drain, or remove the tenacles, until you have drained it piecemeal.
When you have completed your work, apply incense, aloe, and dragon's blood to the wound, and hold it together, and put upon it a moist bandage of oil and wine, or of oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the burn; then raise the patient up on his heel and do not loosen the bandage until the third joint.
And when you have pulled it [the dislocated shoulder], if there is much pain in the limb from oil and water, then cure it with dynafinicon oil and balsamic oil until it is healed.
If pus comes from the wound and corrosion, and swelling of blood in the bladder, or that the urine is retained, which is known in part as without jumping with the urine: then take your dose in the wound, and expel that blood, for if it remains, it will corrupt the bladder and carry it away.</start_of_turn>
Then lift the wound gently and easily and bind it, and help in all ways that you can, until it is healed; and make sure that all the hours you treat it, that you bind the wound tightly and gather the medicines above the limb.</start_of_turn
If the stone is small and is either in the bladder or the urethra, and it is fixed there, and the urine cannot pass; if the physician does what I have said above, then one should listen to the size of this cure. I have already had proof of this.
Take hold of the instrument according to this shape and make it so that there are two angles fixed at the tip: in one hand
Take hold of the instrument according to this shape and make it so that there are two angles fixed at the tip: in one hand, take a thread and bind it around the base of the stone so that it does not slip back into the bladder; then push the instrument into the bladder lightly until it reaches the stone; and rotate the instrument in the stone back and forth until you can pierce the stone from the other side; if the stone is broken and urine comes out, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is still in the bladder. If it is broken and spurts out with the urine, and if there is blood, then the patient is sick;
If you cannot do this for any reason, take hold of the limb with one hand and with the other grasp the bone above and below, then place your thumb between the two joints, and pull forcefully, loosening the ligament, and move the blood clot which is in the wound; and cure as long as it is healed.
If you cannot do this for any reason, take hold of the limb with one hand and with the other grasp the bone above and below, then place your thumb between the two joints, and pull forcefully, loosening the ligament, and move the blood clot which is in the wound; and cure as long as it is healed.
When the bone is dislocated in women, and this happens only once, it is a serious ailment which is defended by two things: the first is that the woman is a virgin; and the second is that no woman knows who has seen her uncover herself as much as she does, even though she is chaste.
And the third method is that if by chance one cannot find a woman who knows this art of hands; and the fourth method is that if the woman's stone is more prominent than the man's, for in that case it is possible to make a deeper incision, and there is greater fear.
If necessary, if you take a mistress who is well aware of this, and prick her flesh, and if you do not find her, know that she is a cunning woman; and present her with a gift that is worthy of a woman of sense, or a woman who knows a part of the art, and command her to do what you command of her with inquiry of the stone.
and look well if the woman is a virgin: then you must push forward her breast or foundation and inquire about the stone; and if she finds it, if you constrain her breast, command her to hold her breast or with the patient, and want and press her left hand on the bladder nearby
If this be true, then command her to move from the groin to the knee of the limb entering the bladder as far as she can reach the root of the thigh; then place your thumb on the knee at the root of the thigh and find the middle of the bone which is usually hidden, and feel the bone in that part; and do not move your thumb above the knee or below, and let the size be small at first.
Then hold the limb steady in the size, if you feel the bone so twisted that the wound becomes larger than it should be, and that many times bones have been fractured in this way: for small, large, rough, smooth, long, and round bones have all been known to fracture. If the fractures resemble each other, it is clear that the bone has been dislocated.</start_of_turn>
And if it does not mend, if you put on a coarse plaster and hold it for an hour until it is dry; then return to your work, until the bone is healed, and have the instruments that I have mentioned for extracting the bone as your home will aid you in your work.
If it does not go by itself, and it is an artery that is cut, put powder on the wound and strain with sponges and bandage, and do not resume this treatment any more; leave the wound alone and do not touch it, except in the case of an accident that causes the patient’s death; then cure the wound.
When the heat of blood is calmed and the limb is relaxed, if you return to this work while the wound is still open.
from a herniated abscess
Ramice aquouse is nothing else but an assembly of moisture or white wax, which is as soft as the seeds of coriander, that contains the egg; and it is called "wax," and never is it properly in the yolk of the egg, if we take care that it is not otherwise. And it is the skin of the seed between the white wax that we have said. That does not happen by chance.
And the formation of this ramus is weak and comes from the seeds, and that matter is spread out
And never does it happen that it comes from percussion on the seeds, and this moisture has many colors: or it is pale yellow, or it is without redness, or black, or pale blue, and so on
And these are the signs of a dislocation of this assembly, for if it is white or pale as we have said, if the abscess is prolonged, that is to say as long as the figure of a fist, and does not yield to pressure, because there is moisture throughout.
And if there is moisture in the flesh itself, if the abscess is prolonged with a part of the egg, and for this reason it is thought that it is another fist;
And if the moisture is between the skin of the coions and the white surface, if you feel it well; then when you see the color of the moisture, if it is like that which is before. According to this, which follows the introduction, judge what is within.
According to this, which follows the introduction, judge what is within. And when we bind them with iron, if it be known that the patient is safe according to this, then we anoint him on his back, on something rather high, and put drops of oil on his cloth;
then we sit on his left side, and command the minister to sit on his right side, and extend the limb to the loin of the ribs like two nails of a nailboard
then take the sponge, and grasp the skin of the ribs among the ribs from the loin to below the navel, and make a complete incision straight across the skin of the ribs until the white marrow is seen, and evacuate it carefully as much as possible.
Then pierce the cavity plain with water, that is to say, a large opening, and drain all the water, and then put on your gloves, and extend the cavity upwards; and do not touch the root of the ribs, but only the cavity itself; cut straight or in pieces immediately the cost of him secretly, for if you do not cut it well it will return the water.
And if the urine spurts out from your work, if you leave it in its place when you have finished the work of the cavity; then reassemble the two bones of the ribs to their natural position, and cure it like the other wounds, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And if you find the urine corrupted by another disease, if you must tie up the veins that are suspended, doubting the discharge of blood; then cut off the limb at the whole suspension, drain the urine, and cure it like we have said.</start_of_turn>
And if the swelling is collected in three parts together, their roots which are two in number; if one part is cut like the first one equally, then wipe the blood away and put on the wound a layer of soft linen soaked in rose oil.
put on another layer of soft wool soaked in wine and oil, and put on the two joints, and put under doubled cloths, and tie it up in such a way as is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and use coarse wool like this form and assemble them by sewing in the armpit, and one of the arms should grasp from the foundation to the back, and the other from the armpit to the side; and the other two fingers grasp the two angles, and be all assembled together the restraint in the armpit loop
And never is this caustic twig of cautery sufficient in size like iron; take rather a cautery of the pointed kind, and grasp the hair of the beard, and if it is split as we have said, if the white substance which contains the venom is revealed.
If you take the cautery in this fashion, and prick that abscess as we have said, and burn with this subtle cautery.
And grasp in every way that you wish, until you have burnt through it; and keep that fire away from the urine; and soak that thing that has been burned is more salve; and keep away from discharge of blood, and more painful than the work of size;
If nothing else hinders you, or if you are forced to make an incision or evacuate blood, or any other thing, do what hinders you, following the instructions given beforehand.
If the patient is fearful and does not wish to wait for this work due to its horror, if he suspects perforation, as I have said, and you are well certain by the signs that the watery swelling has subsided,
then seat the patient down on a level surface; then pierce the abscess at the lower part with all the surrounding tissue wide open, and make the perforation deep enough so that all the pus can drain out; and if the hole is large, so that all the pain is relieved
Then put cotton on the limb and bind it, and leave only the remaining fluid to drain; then cure until the wound is healed.
If the white wool does not allow the fluid to drain from the wound, if you are to drink a penny or the instrument used to treat the hydrops, as is the custom; then enlarge the wound, and let the fluid return, and reassemble after twenty days or when convenient, and when reassembled as before, the patient will then be cured.</start_of_turn>
of the abscess of the buttocks
Wounds which in this section of the twig have fear in more than one place, for it seems to me that the pain is worth leaving them alone.
I shall tell you about the work and the signs of the incision
Therefore, I say that main and forearm come or swell, and sometimes there are coions; and this is by chance.
It is to be known by excessive rubbing and striking, which is spread with coions, or percussion;
And it is the color of an abscess like the color of honey; and there is no pain, and it is an abscess that swells.
And sometimes it is an abscess that is painful and bloody, with a foul color, and never comes from a vein, or from an inflamed vein.</start_of_turn>
When it is not from a vein, if it is known by the position of the abscess from the heat of the cautery, when you press it to your chest; you must not touch it.</start_of_turn
He who is made of swelling of a vein is known by his disposition at the expression of pain in the toes.
and can well make the size above this semblance, and above the other parts; and it is that you grasp the testicles like worms, then the egg is high, and the thread from the testicles is white silk, and deliver the yolk from all parts of the egg.
If the egg is already soaked with these threads, if it is to be known, that you must then treat the egg and hold it.
If it is exposed to air on the surface, or within the vessels, if you must deliver all that is tense, and round off the edges.
If the cartilage comes loose from the bone or remains behind, if you must grasp it all, and pull out the root, as we have said
When your work is finished, if you apply a dressing of coarse wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then bandage the wound until it is healed.
of the incision of the hip bones
This is an abscess enclosed by a covering resembling a berry, with softening of the bones. and the patient groans in pain when he moves it.
and this disease is very painful like the one mentioned above,
we will tell you about this matter, according to what the elders have said.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit in a comfortable position, on an elevation, and then suspend the support of the collar around his neck from your two hands. At the same time as you bring forward the vessels that arise from the edge, and grasp them with your master hand, and extend them forth;
then clamp to the cutting spatula wide through which the vessels are traversed, until they are uncovered,
and then pull from the cheek part, as we have said in the extraction of arteries that are in the temples;
Then I insert a needle or if there is double thread, I bind it to the first root or the head of the nail has come, and I bind it to the other root; Then I compress the swelling in the middle directly, according to the length of the bone, and I drain the corrupted moisture.
Then I cure the wound if like the others or I bandage it, so that no vessel is damaged that would bleed the contents of the wound;
for in this way there is no harm, and if all the vessels come to the head, if you must, you must drain the wound from all the vessels. If the oes does not lose its nourishment from the incision of the vessels, and if they dry and do not swell, they will not aid.
If the oes does not lose its nourishment from the incision of the vessels, and if they dry and do not swell, they will not aid. If the oes does not lose its nourishment from the incision of the vessels, and if they dry and do not swell, they will not aid.
If the oes does not lose its nourishment from the incision of the vessels, and if they dry and do not swell, they will not aid
And the signs when it is of extension downward of the scapula, if there are many and many, in long tension, and does not come immediately; And the scapulae are equal until the margin, because the scapula presses the intestines.</start_of_turn>
And the sign is when the scapula is sectioned, that it immediately causes pain at the shoulder, and the scapulae are different in position, from the edge to the skin, because of the displacement of the intestines and the hardness of the scapula.</start_of_turn>
And never does the bone move with the intestine, and is retained when it is held, and causes great pain to the patient, even when it is pressed.</start_of_turn
And in these iron cures with fear, for fear of them, it is known to escape.
And the method of this work is that if you command or patient that he embrace his intestine with his hand at the bottom of the wound, if he can return it then either hold his collar between your hands, and keep the thighs;
then extend the arm at the shoulder, and close all the skin of the flanks from end to end; Then from the depth of the wound, as much as its size allows, according to what you must do to open the wound, and whatever is necessary; do it in such a way that it does not burst.
Then pull out the fat that is below the skin, as much as the blunt part of the wound is uncovered; leave the fatty tissue uncovered from all sides.
Then insert your two fingers into that which supports the bone, between the white tissue that is under the outer skin and between the second tissue,
and pull out that which is behind the bone, and between the second tissue; and with the right hand grasp the bone of the bones, and extend the white tissue upwards with your left hand, and hold the bone to the whole of the tissue towards the size. And instruct the minister to extend the arm upwards, and loosen that which is above the bandage.
And look if there is any intestine or white fat wrapped around the bone, and if you find nothing, if the belly swells;
Then take a needle or if there is one, thick thread made of twenty threads, and pass it through the back part of the fat, which is behind the skin of the buttocks; after that the size, and then cut the hair that appears from the threads, until there are three threads left; Then gather them together one on top of the other in the form of a cross, and bind the fat, which we have said is behind the skin of the buttocks, with a strong thread of three parts; Then cover the head of the shoulder with folds of cloth, and bind them firmly in three places, so that no vessel other than those which nourish it can enter there, except for incisions. And straighten the limb according to the first limb that is long three fingers from this one, and after these three fingers leave space sufficient for the socket which is as broad as two thumbs;
And afterwards all the rest according to the curve which the ear carries; then press in the part which is as broad as the leather of the nails, as much as it does not strain, and bend, as we said before.
Then mix flaxseed with oil, and apply it to the wound, and bind it up as we have said. And never burn the fat surrounding the wound as we have said, after the incision, out of fear of blood loss.
For this often happens, and leave the limb as long as it bleeds through; and if it swells too much, if it is raised with warm water, and put on what we have said, until it stops bleeding
Then cure the wound of another way, until it is completely healed.
De hernie carnouse.
In this limb I never saw anyone who could cure it with iron.
And the old folks say that it is made just like the limb that joins the vis, in part like tying up blood vessels, after the size above lightly towards the outside;
Then cover it in the middle, and cure the abscess of what causes it, until the blood vessels are quiet; and cure it as we have said, until it is healed.
Never comes routine with pain, as we have said, and open the eyes; and do not feel any intestines as companions, and if any are present, it is enough, and repair them every hour.
and if they stay too long in this place, if you believe the wound or swelling, as long as the intestines are present;
and this happens by the stretching of the sinews which are in pain, as we have said, because they are stretched, then become softened and relaxed the eyes open.</start_of_turn>
and the cure is in the cautery, as we have mentioned before; and never by fire in this manner.
And it is that the patient lies comfortably upon his back between your hands, then grasp the limb of the routure enfleit downward as much as necessary according to the quantity of two fingers.
Then draw out the scab which is beside the skin that covers it, then take hold of the root and bring out the limb appearing from the scab.
And press toward the belly, then cut the two fingers that appear from the scab on the head of the root, and cut one and the other;
Then draw out the root, and do not cover the scab or extend the gut or anything else, as I told you in the treatment of the hernia of the intestines.
Then he treats the wound. And when you have completed the stitches, if the wound leaks and heals the wound, until it is healed.
The scab is constrained, and has no appearance in the course of treatment, and the burn is mute in this limb, and more proximate to health.
of the softening of the skin of the joints
Many times the skin of the joints is softened in households, because the bones that are inside are softened, and it is seen; and it is necessary, when one sees it being cured, to make the patient lie down on his back, and to scrape off the softened skin from the natural skin; then assemble the layers of skin with a bandage, and if you see it, close the first excess of softened skin with two or three stitches firmly; then scrape between the stitches, and cure as the other wounds, until it is healed, and cut the thread.
Dou chastrement.
The burns caused by the cautery are usually despised in our laws; however, for this reason I do not wish to speak of them in this book; and it is not necessary to do so except for two methods: one is that the owner of the burn responds when asked, and the other is that we often have to cauterize certain animals for our assistants, as with a goat or a sheep or a cat and other animals. I say therefore that cautery is performed in two ways: by traction or by incision. In the traction method, we seat the best in warm water, until the boils are softened and for a while; then we grasp them with our hand until they are set and we no longer feel them. As for the cautery of great size: it is necessary to hold the best and press the skin of the boils with our left hand; then bind the dressing and apply pressure to each wound with one hand, when they are well secured; and leave no trace of blood or any trace of blood vessel that is outside the blood vessels; and this method of cautery is milder than that which is done by traction, because at traction remains by chance no trace of the boils, because the best desires to loosen. Then cure the wound until it is healed.
des hermofrodites.
Hermofrodie est selonc deux manieres: une si est que entre les deux coions apert ausi com li figure de la nature d’une femme, ou il ait poil, et aucunes fois en cort li urine. Et li autre maniere si est en femmes, et ait sus lou poignil ausi com une verge et deux coions. Et li cure de l’ome et de la fame si est que tu copes les chars ajostees toutes, et les cure si com autres plaies; en la seconde maniere, des homes dont li urine saut par lou cuir des coions, si n’a point de cure.
Hermaphrodism is in accordance with two methods: one if between the two testes opens just like the nature of a woman, or if there is hair, and sometimes in their urine. And the other method if it is in women, and has on the navel just like a boy and two testes. And the cure of the tumor and envy if it is that you remove all the testicles, and the cure is like other wounds; in the second method, of men whose urine spurts through the skin of the testes, if there is no cure.
Tentigene is a tumor that is above the natural part, as long as it is too heavy to see; and many women have it just like a hand, and this is the cure. It is necessary that you hold the excess of the tenticle at your hand or as an ointment, and treat it lightly; and do not be too rough, for blood does not live there, and the cure is like any other cure as long as it is healthy; and there is another thing that comes out like a bag of barley, and for this reason it is called the old "madness of the mare". If you can cure it, as we have said the tenticle, and cure it as long as it is healthy.
De erratique.
If the nature of the woman is not well perceived, or if the rupture is small; it is natural by birth, or by accident from disease that comes with it; or it is caused by a sudden movement of the jaw, or a swelling of the face or of the eyes, and is made by pushing in the belly, or on the sides, or on the genitals, or whatever; and the conception, and the birth, and by chance the flowers must have. And the knowledge of this is by the regard of the dance. If the swelling appears close to the two breasts, if you are in a hurry, and the woman is behind you, spread out her legs; then the two breasts will form, as long as the swelling of the face is round, and over the swelling. Then take hold, and mix oil, and put it on the wound, and put the woman at home chest to chest, if it cannot be closed. And if the swelling is hard and thick, it is advisable that you leave it to the sponge resembling a bay leaf. If the swelling is of the jaw, if you suspend it at the navel and leave it; have medicines that stop bleeding, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, together with many eggs; then give a large dose of ointment, so that the wound cannot close. And let it be long, and give a try of dry lint; then it will be cured of other cures until it is healed. And if there is a swelling of the jaw in the belly, if you cover it according to this method, it will not be an abscess. For an abscess is not an eruption of pus in the belly.
of hemorrhoids.
Emoroids are open veins that without support are usually not accustomed; and when old become tough. And we have said previously concerning the signs and symptoms, and I shall say those which remain to cure. I say that emoroids and tough skin, when pressed into the marrow, are not felt, except with the cure by iron. Those which are at the edge of the marrow, we can feel, are those which we can cure. It is therefore necessary that you put the woman in a cold house, then hold the needle steady, grasp its root, then sprinkle on restraining medicines such as acacia and dragon’s blood and incense, and similar things; then withdraw the pieces an hour later, then put them into cold water; and if it bleeds, if she sits in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate seeds and elderberry and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and yeast, and make one application upon her back. And if it clots, that is good. If not, if it is bleeding profusely, put on a bandage at the back and has large wounds; then take lint, and moisten it with the juice of plantain or with the juice of elderberry with wine old, and make it bleed. And when the incision is healed, if the wound is oily until it is healed; and that which is called “albathir” is red, and is similar to a rough beard, if you cover it as I have said the tough skin; and then it is healed until it is healed.

And the after-effects of the marrow are many, such as chancre, pierced abscess, herpes, piles, fistulas, emoroids, and chapped abscesses, and other diseases that I mentioned in the division. It is therefore necessary that I say in this treatment the chapped abscesses that come in the marrow, which are not simply abscesses that are closed together; and if you want to know the progress of the treatment, look at the color of the abscess at the beginning and at the end of treatment. Do not be in a hurry to open the abscess, but keep it closed with a cloth bandage or silk stocking. And when the abscess is drained, if you cover the root of the abscess, at the level of the jaw or the spleen, do not remove the dressing until the bleeding has stopped. And when the abscess is healed, if it is oily until it is healed, do not remove the dressing, but leave it in place for a few days. And when the wound is healed, put a few stitches of silk or cotton thread around the edges of the wound and a layer of gauze or cotton wool over the wound and the surrounding area.
De l’enfantement.
From infancy. The midwife first learns what is the natural posture of an infant, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing down on the navel and desirous of smelling the afterbirth: then the child is born immediately; and when the infant’s feet are born according to the natural figure, and the head is delivered first, and is supported by her; and when you see these signs, if you press lightly on the abdomen, so that the child is thrust out; for when he descends on his head, if he is supported by her, and is delivered headfirst, it is because his limbs and hands have been delivered by violent delivery; and this is not natural. For it never comes except by force of the womb or the head, or the arms, or that it comes on the abdomen or afterwards, and is changed by an accident from his collar, and by other harmful figures; if the midwife is skilled in the art and has learned well in these matters, and is wary of errors and deceptions, and I will show her all the figures that she must use to aid her.
When the child is born naturally through the birth canal, and the woman gives birth, and her strength is weak, if you make her sit on a stool, or the women hold her; and as soon as she has relaxed her oil or vernix caseosa, then put her in the water between her two thighs where it is formed: And split the second toe, and bind its nail as long as the moisture which is in its core is forceful; and press the woman’s belly until the fetus descends, and if it does not descend, if you must, clench the woman with muscular spasm of fennel with oil of poppyseed; then make her vomit and expectorate of dung, and keep her mouth and nose covered for an hour: if the fetus is now gone. And if both hands are forced out, if you must, keep them loosely bound together; and if they will not enter, put the woman upon a seat, and hold her feet high; then let down the seat to the earth, and hold her, that she does not cry out; and if the hands will not enter, and the fetus is dead, if you have clasped the hands at the ankle which is before mentioned, and have pulled out the fetus, praise God equally.
And thus comes out the child from its feet. When the fetus comes out from its feet, if you can support it upwards; Then the fire burns out slowly and evenly; until it is equal.
Then take a piece of wood and stretch it out slowly and steadily.</start_of_turn>
Can it jump up just as much as it can, if the command is to grasp it, and make it spit out its seed? if it leaps up, if God wills it.</start_of_turn
If not otherwise forced, as we have said, if the limb is twisted and pulled, as long as it is in its natural position. For in such a case, it is easily loosened.
If not otherwise forced, as we have said, if the limb is twisted and pulled, as long as it is in its natural position. For in such a case, it is easily loosened. And if not otherwise forced, as we have said, if you take an upper muscle, flaxseed oil, gum mastic, and bruise all in a mortar; and put on the woman's body and drive away this swelling. Then make him sit upright in acute pain until the ribs are level;
And when it is moist from the outset, make him drink one spoonful of myrrh and put his head down, and leave him for an hour. Then make him sit on a chair, then make him cough and strain his mouth and throat, and gently grasp his abdomen, for he will now leap up. because of the issue of the child on his genitals. When the boy comes in this shape, if he puts his hands and feet together;
of the issue of the child who comes out with a large hand during I command you to mend the hand: if it cannot be mended, if you do not manage to mend it, then make the woman rise up and be on her guard;
If it does not move, if you manage it over its lip, and it lets go of the legs;
then restore the muscle that I mentioned earlier.
and if it does not yield, if you manage it over its seat, and then rest the limb; and leave it as nature intended, and make it evacuate, and command that it remain fixed until it is healed.
From the issue of the child on his neck, and he spread out his hands, and his face twisted towards his mother’s back. I believe that the child holds out his hand, then twists it back and forth, and leans forward slightly;
And when it is equal, if you put on the muscular substance of height and oil, as we have said, and then command it to move forward and backward
And when you have done this, if you make it sit on its seat, and command it to hold itself; and it will sneeze. From this manner to the very second,
From this manner to the very second, When it comes from this method to the very second, if the second toe grasps your nail, as long as moisture is drained;
and if the foot swells up on its face and neck, if the nail breaks, that it is not retained, and the foot dies.
then take out the child, as long as you have put it if it is right, and command the woman not to do anything like that again.
it must be immediately corrected. For in the work of this chapter, there is often the evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and many die. When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation.
I know this, that they are multiplied, and are severed by the sharp syfac which tears them, which is bound to the bud.
and never comes out so naturally as all at once, as we have said
If it comes out abruptly, as we have said, and the wound is as we have described, and the limb is limp and soft what it does; make it as it should be to save life. Moreover.
Moreover. Moreover, sometimes they are formed in the marrow, that is to say in children up to the age of fifteen, and are all formed in the shape of a child by the measure of their glorious butt,
and it is certain that the butt does all of this, because sometimes similar things happen. if one does as it is commanded.
From childhood death.
When you heal the woman of a dead child or womb, if as I have said in the division, and there is no escape, and you are constrained by the work of your hands; you must consider that if the woman is of sound virtue and has no accident or fear of death;
you must consider that the woman should be supported on her back, and her arms should be lowered and her legs lifted up;
And the minister shall hold the arm at a right angle, or she shall lie upon the bed if she is not treated at the child’s descent.
Then wipe the mouth of the patient with moist hemp oil mixed with alum and fenugreek seeds, and seed of flax, and then anoint his hands with these oils and these poultices. Then hold them in the basin lightly, and give her one or two ounces of wine or other liquid that she can tolerate,
and take care that the child does not rise up on his head; If the nails are forced into the eyes or in the nose or in the mouth or in the beard or pluck hair or force down costae,
If the nails are forced into the eyes or in the nose or in the mouth or in the beard or pluck hair or force down costae, and if the pupil dilates above the eyelid, if the nail is driven in or the pupil is strained and the teeth are loose;
If the nails are forced into the eyes or in the nose or in the mouth or in the beard or pluck hair or force down costae, and if the pupil dilates above the eyelid, if the nail is driven in or the pupil is strained and the teeth are loose, and you must hold the nail with your right hand, put the thumb between the two of your left hand, and support it with all your might, and drive the nail into none of these places that we have said, until it comes to the empty thing.
Then the shoulder blade is found to be another bone, or the third one if you are dealing with it, so that the extraction should be even.
Then it is extended equally by moving from side to side, so that the bone is grasped, and if necessary, the thumbs are clenched to hold it in place like this.</start_of_turn>
And if a part of it remains, if anyone should grasp with two fingers and press it in that part, and treat the other part.</start_of_turn>
And if there is still no movement, if you put this bone or higher up again, and do this until it comes out entirely.</start_of_turn>
And if one hand comes before the other, and it cannot be returned by the stretching, then you must wrap around it with your drape, until it is whole again.</start_of_turn>
then grasp it at the joint of the limb or the root, and so it must be that you do the same with the other hand, and make two thumbs.</start_of_turn>
and if the limb of the child is big and it is twisted in coming out, or if it has or chief pain assembled, If it is certain that you have displaced the spinous process between your two vertebrae, and you make the head and stretch the area, then draw out the pain. Or you can rotate it with the instrument which is called the "almidach", from which it comes with the instruments or the chapter that follows this one.</start_of_turn>
and in this way make it swell with a great natural head; and then treat for the bones as tenacious,
And if the shoulder joint suddenly dislocates and is forced, if it is fractured, while the moisture that is either there or comes out is still there;
and if it cannot be reduced, if the bone snaps into pieces with the movement that you make.
and if it is embedded in the belly or if the ribs are fractured, if you must pierce through as much as the moisture corrects.
And if the swelling is on its side, if the limb is attracted downwards, and the approach to the mouth of the wound is easier.
And if it is swollen in the belly or the wrist, it is suitable that you extract it [the swelling] with a drape wrapped around the hand. and keep the belly or the wrist, as long as the moisture which is in it is corrected
and if another limb is fractured, and the limb is dislocated, if the limb is struck by a stone or something heavy, and the limb is treated up to the mouth of the wound; Then indeed, one must anoint or grease it, and do the treatment.
and if there is moisture in the wound, it is held back by the cautery which has been done, if one cannot bear to travel, then one must bring moist and oily things along. and one must apply poultices, and soak in soft water that is moistening and soothing.
If the forearm is resting on its costal margin, and you must set it even, if necessary remind what was said concerning the living child.
If he does not recover, if his limb is torn away piece by piece, and you leave nothing of the second limb behind.</start_of_turn>
And when you have done this, if what we have said concerning abscesses comes to pass as often happens in the marshes.</start_of_turn
And if blood comes out, whether from a restricted vein or other cure.
And I saw a woman in whom a fetus had died, then consulted another concerning it, and refuted the other. After a long time, there came an abscess in the belly, and it grew so large that it burst, and began to cause great pain.</start_of_turn>
I went to seek help, and I thought for a long time, and could not soothe the wound.</start_of_turn
I put on strong dressing, and out came a bone, and after that some days another.</start_of_turn I marvel at you, for your belly has no bones.
I thought it was the bones of a dead child.
I wish for the wound to be healed, and with hands of bone, as long as the woman is in better condition; and saw the woman long tense and thus bowed down with her head;
And I have never seen this chapter except for the time when the master found an unusual thing that he had to help with.
to reset the dislocation to its place
Then comes the form of pressure, which we call books; and at this time there are two tears of blood from two veins. However, the corners are more subtle of restriction, and are made of ebony or boxwood;
And let the mouth be full of soft things, such as dates and almonds, and of long duration, a palm and a half in length. And let the two lips be supported by these same soft things, which are closed in one and the other, half a palm or more in length.
And these two supports are put in the mouth of the patient to open when the two corners are turned.
Another form, more subtle and lighter, is made of ebony or boxwood, according to the resemblance of the teeth; And thus are there again six joints in the arm, as you see, from the elbow to the wrist, two of large size.
And when you see the arm open with all its instruments, if you make the woman sit with her head low, the pieces nearby and the legs extended, then grasp the two joints together in the arm, and hold the chief of the instrument between her thighs; then open your hand over all the instruments, as if you had made the handle equally, according to the quantity that you see open the mouth of the arm, until it makes what it wants.
These instruments are all very burdensome, and their resemblance is multiplied; and when one sees them appear, the work hastens, and the houses are more numerous than before.
If one does not despair of the instrument that has not appeared, for its need is not to be excused.</start_of_turn>
When the second [tooth] is retained in infancy, if you command the patient to retain its socket, and then make her spit it out with force, and restrain your hands to the mouth and the chin.</start_of_turn and if it leaps out for this reason, well and good.</start_of_turn>
If not, take one pot and make a hole or incision, and put herbs in it that can open the mouth of the mare, like chamomile, rue, anis, camomille, cassia and centaury.
All these herbs, or some of them, whether cooked or boiled in water over the fire; then put a leech or incision in the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the mare,
and keep the hair inside the mare until the steam comes out of the mare; then make her sneeze, as we have said. If the second limb is affected by the disease. And if it remains after this treatment, and is not better, as is commanded in the dance, let her wet her left hand in oil of sesam or in alum, and then put it back in its place.</start_of_turn>
and if the second limb is affected; and when she has found it, if she grasps it and extends it forward and backward, so that the marrow does not bleed at the extraction.</start_of_turn but must move gently to and fro, and then treat; for if it comes and dries, it will go away.</start_of_turn
And if the mouth of the marrow is fractured, as we have said, for the cure we have mentioned, and fumigation of herbs.
and if it is not from all that we have said, if you keep silent;
but it is necessary that what is at the mouth of the marrow, you bind to the hip of the woman, and then close with oil tetrafarmaçon;
if she cries and is reset, and comes out forcefully; but nevertheless, when she has cried if there comes a bad odor to the stomach and the head, and bleaches the patient.
If it is necessary, indeed, to perform fumigations, take heed: neither of the ancients has ever experienced fumigation with rue herbs and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which we fumigate the woman at the time of her menses and of the second stage is thus: ...
It is like a cane, and one puts the upper part over the fire, and the hair above the fire; ...
Or on can do fumigations over charcoal, and the pitch until it is consumed, and start another.
To pierce the foundation
When a limb is born without properly perceiving its foundation, it is stamped upon by something subtle which hinders its growth. if you wish to cause it to pierce that obstacle at its root, and do not pierce it too deeply, and keep the surrounding area untouched
then put on soft padding made of wine and oil, and then the dressing until it is healed.
If you doubt that it will stay in place, if you put or pull out a splinter of lead, leave the hands still for a while, and keep the limb still as long as the patient sees the fever rise in bed.
Never comes this time from the stamping of wounds or incisions; if you must cover that stamping: if it be cured, as we have said of the splinter of lead.</start_of_turn>
of the fistula from its foundation are nodules and grow larger as they come from below the foundation, or from between the two parts of the body,
If there is a fistula or several; and when that swelling is old, if it is on the back, and is accompanied by moisture that oozes white or pale blood,
If there is a fistula or several; and when that swelling is old, if it is on the back, and is accompanied by moisture that oozes white or pale blood, they never disappear; and they are known by the fact that the patient evacuates or expels material through them, or by the fact that there is an opening or wound in the neighbourhood of the fistula when the patient evacuates.
And if there are fistulas that penetrate as far as the bladder, and halfway up the thigh; and reach as far as the joint of the hip, and even to the coccyx bone.
And thus it is known that the fistula persists at the foundation, and does not disappear: And thus it is known that the fistula persists at the foundation, and does not disappear: and that you bite your thumb or foundation, and there comes out a fine needle of spider or iron in the fistula when there is no twisting.
And if there is twisting, if there is a attempt of a sponge, or hair, as long as you feel the attempt or the hair on your thumb;
and if you do not feel it, and there is no discharge of blood, no pain, no wind or fever, as we have said. The wounds that they do not pierce through; if you hurry to cure them.
When the fistula is made through to the bladder or the urine tube, if in a leap the urine escapes, and cannot be stopped by medicines.
If it is made through to the hip joint, if there is a vein running up to the root; if there is no swelling and pain in the joint, if it is only slightly bowed, and no medicine or remedy with oil is of any use.
And in these fistula people have no other cure but toil, and the vanity of empty minds that intervene between them.
And that which is neither new nor ancient, has hope of health through iron, as I have shown
and lies between your hands on its back; and the legs are stretched out to its hips, and the hips are inclined towards the belly. then there is an attempt of an spider, or a plunge if there is discomfort, until you feel pain or the attempt comes.
If the patient feels the pain at the root, if you must drink your thumb and index finger,
If the patient feels the pain at the root, if you must drink your thumb and index finger, you must know that he has already perceived it; and either uncover the root or if you feel between your thumb and index finger the marrow or bone, then there is swelling that is persistent. if you do not uncover it immediately, it will not heal.
We can do nothing to cure it well without uncovering it; there is indeed some;
And the aid which is done with it [the fire cautery] is that if it is grasped firmly the cautery is done according to the size of the fistula, as it is said before. And the rest is burnt in the fistula, as far as it comes from the root; do this once or twice, until you are sure that these hairs must be burnt, which are like a bundle of hair
and then the cure of moist wounds is made with blunt needles, as long as the hair has not burst, and then the cure of ointment is made with oil and solder.
If it is well, that is good. But if not, it cannot be cured;
And if it [the head of the shoulder] attempts to slip in, do not force it past the root which is either the bone or the foundation; and between the root and the attempt, cover with a thick covering of hair or silk, and you will see the fistula at that which sustains the covering from breaking. If the root of the fistula has slipped forward before the attempt, and the burn afterward, until it reaches the top of the attempt;
and will be freed from the attempt, and will recover; then smear those hairs which seem like a sparrow’s feather, and there will be nothing left.
If he will not move, and if there is a wound between you and the work, if the fire cautery or medical potion is rough.
For the fire cautery joins together two bones: that is to say, the burning of these bones around the edges, the effusion of blood and the drying up of moisture.
Then the treatment of wounds full of pus, in burn or in cut, until the bones burn in the wound;
Then treat the wound of the suppurating wound with dry herbs, and these are the dry medicines.
For when it is restored, if it is healed and does not return.
And if the fistula comes up to the root of the bone, and is loosened from the flesh, if the thumb or root of the bone is grasped or pulled out, inquire about that.</start_of_turn>
If you feel the attempt, and between these is the thread or silk or cord, or it is close to piercing, if there is no greater force than the way of escape and hope, by the administration of one of the three methods:
or you cauterize it as we have said, or you bind it until it is healed, or if you wish you may do so with attempts and care as before.</start_of_turn>
And do not be too hasty, for you must cover the support that holds the foundation, and let the egestion go in the natural order. Then cure it, as we have said;
Then cure it, as we have said; by chance if it is well, or you loosen the covering and the wound is again covered after it has been cut from the foundation, or by means of a hook or other pointed instrument; Then bind up this wound which is in the wound, as you are able;
Then study to restore the wound, and to stop the fistula at the lower part of the foundation: if it is a less serious matter for the patient.
And never are fistulas cured in this way: when you bite the attempt in the fistula, and it is either too late or costs the undermining of the lower part of the foundation under the skin. if you take a perceived attempt at the head according to this form: And if you see that the thread is torn in two, and the attempt is at the root of the fistula until it is at the head
If the limb hangs low at the root of the bone, then grasp the thread of that limb which hangs down, so that you swallow the root or the foundation.
If you pull the head of the limb and reunite the joints together, and strain one against the other, and leave it hanging one or two fingers;
and restrain it never, until these hairs that are between the bones and nails are cut off.
Then cure the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not burst, if you force it to burst in every way you can, it will not be too deeply seated.
For it does not suffice to make the opening wide by force, and then cure it, as we have said, until it is sound
The form of the thorny spawl from which the fistula arises is rough and trenchant; and on must not cope with it, as you see here:
Emorrydes sont selon ce qu’il y a de plusieurs sortes: ou elles sont dans le fondement, comme du grain de résine, et s’il en a de petites et de grandes, et en cort adés sans bande. et s’il en a une ou plusieurs, et sont défuyées du fondement et du chef du fondement; mais celles qui sont défuyées si ont beaucoup de moisissure.
et sont accompagnées d’un cort adés ou d’un peu d’eau citronnée ou d’un peu de sang; et ont la couleur du corps.
And for the cure of those who have it in the foundation, if you command the patient to groan in order to depart to his chamber, while the foundations are still strong, and uncover the hair; if you hurry, and grasp it with your nails, or hold it with your finger, then grasp it at the root.</start_of_turn>
and if it comes loose, do not attempt to hold it by its moisture, but grasp it with cloth, or cotton, or a piece of chamlet.</start_of_turn and pull them from your shoulders, then grasp them, and powder over them warm powders that are in place of cautery.</start_of_turn Or thou causest them to be cauterized as it is said or in the manner of fire cautery, and afterwards thou shalt cure them of other cures while they are sound.
And if the roots cannot endure the biting, if thou clench the patient’s teeth tightly clenched with biting and rough to uncover what is or is the root, if it can endure to open openly
the patient does not feel pain, and if the thread is for the root, the cure is slight; and take them between thy nail or tweezers, and hold them together, and cure them as we have said, while they are sound, and avoid the incision with fire.
If you wish to secure the suture according to this method: take one thread, pierce it through a needle, then pass the thread through from below and remove the needle from the other side, and twist the two ends of the thread around the needle. and if it is of great size; tighten the thread firmly, then knot the thread and withdraw the needle, and secure all the others, and leave one to correct the excess of blood;
then put upon the foundation one moistened bandage in rose oil or beeswax, and put upon the foundation, and command the patient to rest;
Then leave it until it shrinks, and when it does, if the cure of soaking and other treatments are applied while it is sound.
when it is completely dry or firm There is often dryness of the bowels in this disease, and by constriction of nature, and when the disease is old and medicine is of no avail.
If you must keep it at the point of a hair or at the nail of the nail, which does not let it become moist; Then treat it until it is healed if it is necessary;
and if it cannot be soothed, if you must repeat the procedure more strongly than before, until it subsides, and be escorted. Then treat it until it is healed.
indeed Formice est une petite apparance fautree antor le cors, et va mout em parfont.
Formice is a little sign seen before the disease, and goes out of measure; and never does it cease to irritate, and is felt as if dead weight, and comes into the whole body, and more than in other parts.
And the cure is if you take a spoonful of rue or strong rue, and put that salve on the wound, until it circles round the wound throughout; then turn your hand all around the wound until you cover it throughout, and put it in place, and scrape the wound from its roots.
And if you see that he does this with a spider or a nail according to this form, and be discreet and restrain him from below:
And if you see that he does this with a spider or a nail according to this form, and be discreet and restrain him from below, do not notice, for must hold still, and must press. And if you see that he does this, if he bites forward or during the cautery.
of this form. Never make a cautery of silver or gold, or of a melted spider or flea; and never make of these small and great instruments except as they are brought.
Those who are feeble and painful in the cure of children are small.
They are small both in chest and belly, or the belly is bound according to this manner:
and there is a swelling or the belly is bound, as you see, and the limb is pierced either on one side or the other.
or the belly is bound with a bladder of silk or parchment, and the wound is pierced all around the circumference of the limb,
And there is between each hole [of the cautery] an inch [of space], then pass through these holes a strong thread of strong wire twisted ten or twelve times, or until it enters the core, and assemble the belly as if it were a nail. When the physician is inside, if the thread has in front of it a strong wire, then clinch; and that is the form of a circle:
And let neither the physician be too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clamp with oil or beeswax of an egg, or something similar, and then hold it lightly.
Then the physician grasps his thumbs together, as long as the wound is visible, and stretches the clisteer, and the patient extends his legs toward the surface.
And if the physician sees that it will burst, if the wound is deep; and if he sleeps all night long, it is better to provide greater help.</start_of_turn>
And if you clip the vein in the case of a wound of the belly, and the physician hastens to go out, if it starts again as long as it is harmless.</start_of_turn
And if there are blood clots or pus, or an abscess, if the clisteer is as subtle as for a child;
And thus is the shape of a subtle blister that appears when the skin is stretched:
and thus is the shape of a subtle blister that appears when the skin is stretched:
and thus is the shape of a subtle blister that appears when the skin is stretched: when the skin is stretched, a subtle blister will form. We have already mentioned the cure for wounds; or you may say the cure for hands and medicine, according to the completion.
I say that wounds are diverse depending on what causes them and depending on the place or the wounds are made, and how they are made.
Things done for wounds are done by cutting with a stone, or of spear, and nail, or lance, or fist, or knife, or similar things.
or they are done according to the location of the wound, such as a wound on the head, or on the shoulder, or the arm, or the belly, or the liver, or other parts of the body.
I will tell you about the treatment of simple wounds, and I will begin with wounds of the head, for the memory will come to you in this chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes or a head wound, and the bone is not broken, if you take care that it is cut with a stone or some other things, and the skin is completely torn and the wound is large, And you doubt the wound above: if you do it too soon after the wound has healed, there will be blood from the wound itself rather than from the head of the limb; and let the blood be to the part above rather than below.
And listen to the patient’s bloating from wine and fatty foods.</start_of_turn>
And if he does not see improvement, if either his meat is diminished or he drinks no wine, eats no meat;
and take out the wound, if there is swelling, cover it with a soft cloth soaked in rose oil only, or in astringent wine.
If there is no surrounding wound, if you put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not moved by air, dust, I will tell you about it later.
If the blood has moved, if you put on some sponges, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And if the wound is great like a nail and some, and the limbs do not stick together by themselves, if you join them together by stitching, as I will tell you about wounds of the belly, of stitching.</start_of_turn>
If the wound is uncovered of bone, and is split open, and holds only a little, if it breaks; then cure the wound with medicine, and restore flesh in place of skin.</start_of_turn And command the patient to eat coarse meats, such as testicles and wheat germ, as well as poultry, and similar things.
And if you find or smell decay, and it is not at the bone, if you cut it out completely, and pour out pus, then cure it.</start_of_turn>
And if there is an artery in the wound or vein, which without treatment will not stay contained by medicines, if you can ligate it with a thread; And if that does not help, if you must cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, if it is a minor cure: put on this powder which makes them adhere as well as when they were moved.
And the manner of this powder is: take incense one part; dragon’s blood two parts; and live chalk three parts, and mix them all up thoroughly.</start_of_turn> and apply the wound, and hold it firmly, until it heals well and joins together with all its blood vessels.</start_of_turn>
and then bind it well, and leave it to heal, if it does not swell; for we do not leave the medicine in until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And never do we perform this treatment alone, when we do not have the incense or blood of a dragon, but only when the wound has not moved.
And if the wound has moved from its place, even in this state, if we do not put on this powder immediately;
but put on some digestive poultices or flour-and-honey poultices, as long as they bleed profusely; then apply other treatments until it is healed.
And if the fracture of a bone comes with the wound, and it is small, if the extraction has punctures similar to fine needles;
And I will tell you later about the fractures of the skull.
of the wound of the neck.
The wound comes from the neck and it is simple, if there is no difference between it and that of the skull, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is severed.
If this is the nerve, if there is no other remedy except to leave the wound open, and do not put anything restraining, for it is night and makes the wound shrink; and do not put anything greasy on the wound, for the substance of the nerve is cold, and the continuation of the pain is with the brain, which is the most severe pain of all.</start_of_turn>
but if the medicine is strong, like warm water boiled in sweet vinegar, and mixed with rosemary oil, and vinegar boiled in sweet vinegar,  </start_of_turn and other stones of this kind, and moist compresses.</start_of_turn>
If the wound is large, if the bone and surrounding tissue are split, then treat it until it is healed.
If the wound is deep and extends through bone and is full of blood, if the opening is low or deeper, then...
If an artery is ruptured, and blood flows freely, if the bleeding is severe, and the blood vessels and fat are cauterized together...
If the rib is fractured, or the spine is bruised, and the limb is supported, so that the meat will remain in place... If the nail of the thumb rests on the chin of the throat, and do not touch the throat but return it to its natural position. Then it will strain immediately, and leave them hanging for a while, and then cure the swelling of the throat as long as it is healthy;
and if it has made an imprint in the bone, if necessary; and if there are pieces of bone, if the fractures are all broken through, and those that you cannot have, if you leave them too long, And let the issue be freed and aligned;
And if the wound is fresh, sprinkle some powder on it as I have said.</start_of_turn> And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, if the cure is as I have said in the chapter.</start_of_turn
of a wound from a lance or a knife.</start_of_turn>
If it be from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, if you see that the wound bursts with a violent gust of wind, the arrow is certainly mortal; then remove the arrow immediately.
If it is not deep and is fresh throughout its extent, if you do not put powder on it at the first hour, do not bind it up for the sake of the wound alone, for it will swell up again in proportion as it hardens and returns to its place, and frees the patient; but I put on an attractive dressing, and bind it once more.
And if you have no other remedy, put into the wound much cotton to absorb the moisture.
and keep the patient lying on the wound for two or three days, or more if there is no spasm, do not tremble the body or limbs excessively; and when you see the bones displaced, if the wound is saved. Cure la donques de tentes et d’autres cures, tant qu’il soit sanez;
Cure the swelling of boils and other cures, as long as they are healthy; if they do not heal, and if there is an abscess, keep the incisions open as long as necessary.
And if the wound is an incision of a spear or knife, and it is simple or deep, or on the front or back, if the cure of that which is before is not sufficient;
and if it is great, it is sutured; and if it is small, it is powdered, and if it is embedded in the bone, and there is a break in pieces, if you want the wound to heal, and the wounds to disappear if they are inflamed; If they are not evacuated, if he leaves it to run its course, if he alights the extraction;
If they are not evacuated, if he leaves it to run its course, if he alights the extraction, thus other wounds will also judge him as we have said.
thus other wounds will also judge him as we have said.
The displacement of the belly is great and medium and small;
From great wounds, no time for the intestines or nerves of the intestines, because of the emission of pus;
and the wound is more painful, and never is better than a small wound than a large one.</start_of_turn>
because of that, we must not puncture the intestines again and again.</start_of_turn because the intestines swell so much that they feel pain, if we puncture them again.</start_of_turn>
For this reason, it is worth mentioning every wound, for in this way we can remember the intestines in their place as well as other things.
And the discharge of the intestines from the belly is in three ways:
the three common sutures come out in the belly stitch,
and the sutures of other wounds of the body and other specific sutures are common as other wounds;
And all these things are better with a stitch in the belly, and I shall say a word and declare.
I say that when the wound is small and there is nothing wrong with the intestines, and all things must be done by one of two methods: or for the smallness of the wound, as we have said, Or for that the intestine is swollen with fruit.
When it is cold, evacuate the fruit in a moderate amount: dampen a towel or something similar with cold water only, or when it boils and pricks and stings, And the intestine was forced out as much as the belly was bony;
nevertheless did this wine restrict it, and was mute that awe soul because of swelling
And when you see the swelling depart, if moist urine of the intestine is full or high and cooked, because by this means is the entrance to all things aligned;
If it cannot enter, if you make a hole in the wound with the instrument, grasp the blood clots;
and the first treatment is to dry the wound that is the size.</start_of_turn> it should not be cut excessively without great necessity.</start_of_turn>
and this is the instrument for cutting:
If the limb hangs limp and rigid in the armpit, and cannot be pulled out, and if this be its form:
And when the wound is swollen and the intestines protrude, if it is reset according to its natural form in its own place, but if you do not, for it is worth nothing.
When the wound is wide, and it is in the lower part of the belly, if you think that you can manage the patient on their back, put their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the lower part of the belly,
If the head and the arm are higher than the lower parts, and the shoulder joint is dislocated in one of the two parts. then put the upper part of the limb higher than the lower part;
and thus you must consider the wound to be great and deep.
Small wounds cause that which appears to you.
Then hold between your hands, that is to say, place your hands under it, so that it holds all the way along its course. and close the jaws; that is the common method of stitching,
that is the common method of stitching, And take an awl or more, according to the quantity of the wound's size. Then leave the head of the wound, that is to say give it some space, and pierce with an awl or if there is need, a strong thread; and pierce the skin with the awl or needle through the fat and muscle,
then strain a double thread around the hook of three parts.</start_of_turn> and assemble the three heads of the wound together immediately,
and then leave one space and insert another hook; Then the thread will follow as if you had made the first hook. and do not stop doing this until you have made as many hooks as you desired until all the wounds are bound up;
and the hooks are softened, between soft and hard, For the subtle needles pierce all the flesh, and the too large ones if they do not penetrate me well. Therefore it is necessary that they be blunt;
neither must they pierce too deeply the fat and the skin,
for they must not break or open the wound before it has healed.
And then grasp the head of the needles, so that they do not prick the patient while sleeping. and I put tents or cloths on the head of the needles to hold them in place, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of stitching is more convenient for small wounds, For there is often a thorn or something sharp.
The second costure is common. and is that you assemble the shoulder bones together with the cartilages and the fatty tissue, with a thorn or if there is much thick thread in between; for the fire of the cautery is hot and makes the fat move.
for the fire of the cautery is hot and makes the fat move. If you leave it at the start or if you have begun it, in this manner we shall tear out the nails.
and insert between the ribs the thickness of a nut
this rib is for the body,
and I sew up a wound like that which has been there for a long time,
Who was the master of a knife, who had a wound more than half the size of his palm, and these were intestines well more than two palms wide,
and the wound was in the middle of the belly. I will return the intestines when they have been out for .xxiiij. hours.
The wound was closed after .xv. days, and the cure was applied, and it healed well.</start_of_turn>
And they said of the miracle that it had saved his life, and this was a miracle.</start_of_turn
and I did not fear death, for I was in a place where there was neither medicine nor any remedy; And the method more effective for wounds is to apply a little soot once or twice a day, and to pour honey on the wound until it is healed.
Or thus I will tell you of the three proper methods of dressing:
take the needle, and pass it under the lower part until it reaches this depth;
when it has pierced the right angle of the right, if you see that the chief is swollen or cramped or that you have pulled the needle,
And the pain comes from another side from the inside until it escapes;
And the understanding of this condition is that if you touch as the leatherworker does the leather, and once you have let go of one side of the scab, and grasp it from the other side, until the condition is fully remedied.
The second method of treatment is that of Galiens, which is done promptly,
If it is thus as if no one does it, who assemble the two parts naturally, and touch one head to the other head, in a straight line.
insert an awl or hook near the root, and make the latter only pierce through, then leave the two parts joined together; Then draw the needle and make it pierce from the lower part up to this very point, Then draw the needle and make it pierce from the lower part up to this very point, as is often done with fractures of the scapula.</start_of_turn>
Then draw the needle and make it pierce from the lower part up to this very point, in other words, through other bones that are opposite each other.</start_of_turn>
and this is the common way of treating and the most common.
If anyone doubts this word, and no one bears witness,
If anyone doubts this word, and no one bears witness,
and must suture the one needle from one side and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew wounds
and the like when the wound is inside the belly. If it is more painful to sew a wound on the belly than on others like it.
The wound is judged to be as painful as others like it:
and that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, even though it has moved, if you stop the intestine and the wound; then put on the healing powder charcoal.
if you stop the intestine and the wound; then put on the healing powder charcoal. And if the limb has moved, if you put on no support whatever, until the wound has healed; the flesh will tear, and the sinews will be loosened, and the marrow will burst. then cure the wound like the others, as long as it is healthy;
and if you have no medicines, if you put on, until it starts to swell, cotton wool, And the limb moved once again when it was supposed to be healed.
For you need no other remedy in these situations except for simple wounds.</start_of_turn>
and if you doubt that the wound will not heal properly, the main parts will suffer.</start_of_turn if you must moisten coarse linen with lukewarm oil, or with rose oil, And put the hands inward, and loosen the buttocks.
And if he feels pain or swelling in the belly, and this often happens, if the clusters of black wine swell up and the swelling comes right up to the intestines;
and the large intestines are more likely to be healed than the small ones.
The intestines which are called "jeuns" cannot heal when they are swollen. It is because of the distension of the veins and the lightness of the whole body, and the nearness of their nature to nerves.
And if the gut leaps from the wound, if you reset it behind as the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is yellow or black, if you must bind the black part, that there be no evacuation of blood, For there are veins and arteries;
then comes what is between the flesh and bone, and put the joints loose from the lower part of the wound until they are aligned when the bone is cut, and the wound closes.
because of the pain of the burn
When the intestine is round and the wound is small, if one can restore the gut in its usual place.</start_of_turn>
because I saw that some bones were fractured or bellies were pierced by a lance;
and the wound was at the side of the stomach, And became filled and formed a fistula, and in this it was the evacuation and the swelling.
I will provide care according to this and will not cease until he is healed, and will keep him warm.</start_of_turn>
And when I see him soldered, I doubt that the patient has no pain in his belly; and there is no pain, but remains in better conditions, and food and drink;
And they say that whenever there is a small wound in the intestines, it must be ligated in a moderate degree: then take forceps from great testicles, and then unite the layers of the wound.</start_of_turn> and when the forceps have passed through the opening, if you put on the two layers,
Then he puts another weight afterwards in like manner as before, until the wound is completely closed;
and closes the wound.</start_of_turn> When the chief is burned in the intestines, and there is no further discomfort to the patient,
And if one can tie the intestine with a fine thread which is cut from another intestine,
thus in part. take the head of this thread of intestine that is quite free from discharge, then tie the head of this thread to a thread of linen that is about the same size, Then pass the thread through the needle, and sew the intestine, and retain it in its course.
and this manner of stitching of flesh is not fierce except according to the way of marriage and hope.
and if the wound is great and wide, even if it is in one of the great intestines, if there is no other remedy, save only for slightness.
of fistula or that it be Wounds and incisions, when they burst, if they are called universally "fistules", and indeed when they are split and the wound has burst.
it is indeed called a fistula when the wound is tough and bloody, or when there is no pain, it is as if the pen of a bird were broken;
And never in a clear bow, and sometimes loosely; And never in a clear stance, and sometimes loosely; sometimes almost, and sometimes rather.</start_of_turn>
and I have already spoken of it in the division of wounds, that every wound that is not cleansed, and there is pus, this is only by one of the eight causes:
It is known that by small bleeding of blood or bone, or by its malice; or because there is hardness within and on the limbs, that does not allow them to grow. or because there is too much bowe; When the limb is rigid, and the matter is of poor quality; when medicine is not good in the treatment.</start_of_turn> or because the corruption is like pestilence.</start_of_turn or because the property in the region is late digestion is late and health is fleeting by nature; Or if there are veins or bones:
Or if there are veins or bones, I have already mentioned these causes, their signs, and the treatments for medicines in this division.
Or you should know that I will tell you about the cure for fistula, which is made by the work of the hands.
The wounds that cause fistula happen in all members with pain; For there are fistulas that come from great veins, and from arteries, and from nerves. or at the spleen, or in the intestine, or in the bladder, or at some of the ribs, or at the spine, or in any joint of the hands or feet;
And all the fistulas that arise from this manner are of grievous healing, and there is no other way but toil and ignorance.
and if there is no fistula that does not come out except as I have said, and you have promised healing, and you see that it is known, if you take an attempt to drain or cut, if the fistula is straight, if it is cured;
and if the fistula is twisted, if the attempt of a subtle hand to plunge, For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
and if they burst through the hands and you cannot keep them closed with sutures, if the liquid bursts through one of the holes,
because moisture is so thin from one hole to another, and fills the world;
Then when the wound is clean and your hand is still, if you know whether there are bones or nerves, and if it is firmly closed,
ask the patient well about the pain he feels when you press your hand, and where he feels it;
then you will know whether it is a bone or a nerve that is causing the problem.</start_turn> or in all these things that I have mentioned, if the pain persists as I have told you,
or in all these things that I have mentioned, if the pain persists as I have told you, And bone for the fractures and corrupted carts that are within. and then the treatment until it is healed,
and if the fistula is well deep from the right place, if you can cope with the wound, as you wish, then I put soft sponges in medicine along, and I hold them until the fistula is healed,
then I put soft sponges in medicine along, and I hold them until the fistula is healed, As long as the medicine consumes the superfluity which is decomposed at the root.
and then it puts ointment in oily substances, as long as it is clean;
and if it is not clean by this, if we must cauterize as we have said,
and if the bone is corrupted by fistula, if we must amputate it. If the vein or main nerves do not trouble you or the principal limbs, as we have said;
if the bone is discovered, and there is corruption and blackness, if the limb remains as long as the corruption is whole bone-like. then the physician should do things that will make the limb sound;
if it is not sound, and if it has gone back as before, saiches que tu n’es mie alez jusc’a font:
saiches that you must not remove until they have fallen out naturally: if you pull them out too soon and with force, they will break and cause more harm. then break off all the corruption, and then reset the limb;
and if it is now sound, that is good. If not, extract the pus that corruption has made too much, for you will not be able to recover. If there is no other remedy except to leave it to its natural course;
if there is a small broken bone, and you attempt to treat it, you will only worsen it, if the instrument is too large for the wound,
If there is any bone remaining, if the wounds are deep, do not leave any [tissue] untaken.
If moisture opposes you, and there is no fault or fear, If bone and moisture and force contend, and deliver the bones.
And if you do not remove them at once, if you place over the wound something that causes corruption, And let the hair grow until it reaches the bones,
And then if it is pricked at its root, keep the eyes still so that they do not move until they grow.
and if it is a great bone, as a limb or thigh, then it must be soothed so that the corruption is completely overcome by the hardness of the bone. Then restore the wound.
And if there is a great part of corruption, and comes almost to the bone; then cover it with silk and cover all until the corruption is gone, and then cure it until it is healed;
and I will tell you of a fistula that had one hole in the leg, If you take example and help in your work.
There once was a young man who was about thirty years old, who had pain in his leg due to something inside his body.
as long as the matter came to his leg, and he fled from a large abscess, and there was no apparent cause for opening it;
but he made more abscesses than he opened And in running out of matter, it became fistula, and there came out matter that filled the wound and moisture with blood;
And remained there for a year and a half, and there was no wise man in the art of healing it.</start_of_turn>
until I left there, and came to see the limb and the medicines which they were using to heal it. and what came out through the wound had great blood; And it became red the color of youth, and had the color of citrine.
I bound a loop in one of these holes, and then circled all the holes,
and found that one followed the other from all parts of the limb.
and I cut in one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, And the wound was corrupted and putrefied, and it went right up to the bone inside;
And I saw that which appeared to me as corrupted bone, and I cared that there was no other corruption, except for this which I held.
and I began to restore the wound with soothing medicines for a long time, but I could not mend it
and then I recommenced, and discovered the bone just as before,
And I found the corruption continuing in the bone, the marrow, and then the bone itself, and I was moved to solder the limb.
but I could not do so until I had grasped a palm of the bone, and the traitor forced me to all his might then I restored him to health; and he was healed and soldered soundly,
and did not wish to resume the work for the weakness of the patient, who was unable to endure it. And for fear of death that I shun from him. For often there is the evacuation of blood, but he remained entirely unharmed.
For often there is the evacuation of blood, but he remained entirely unharmed. and there arose from the bone a hard scale, and was of good disposition and not point of discomfort or contradiction of any kind, neither to the ailment nor to coming to that
and extend the head, so that you can tear away the corrupt flesh at the base. And uncover the flesh above the limb or you see hair, that the hair does not split the flesh. And put one cushion or a spoonful of fat over the bone to cover the corrupted flesh. And cover so much hair as one can see and feel the corruption, and cover it once more.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not open wide, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part, If you uncover the whole limb; then put on one stone weight,
If you uncover the whole limb; then put on one stone weight,
and if the swelling is in the joint, if you press the corrupted joint, and bind the bone or what is contained on the other side;
and if the swelling is in the continuation of the joints, if there is no other vein but that of cover;
If the limb is deformed or hangs awkwardly from the hand or the foot, if the pain is great in such a thing, If the limb is deformed or hangs awkwardly from the hand or the foot, if the pain is great in such a thing, then it is necessary to inquire about that dislocation; comment it happened to you. and keep the limb still in all ways possible, but do not obstruct the vein or nerve.
and that the incisions of the bones and the covering tissues are numerous, according to the size of the bones and the appearance of pain. And their greatness and their subtlety, and their magnitude and their smallness, and their hardness; And for this reason it is prudent to appear with some semblance of work in order to deceive the instrument;
and the tools that the work will show you, according to the knowledge of this art, and the testimony of the manner of the diseases; If you think the instrument which you must use is appropriate according to this, then use it.
If you think the instrument which you must use is appropriate according to this, then use it. The head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, or by pressure, or by force;
and when you will have treated the bruise with the means of medicine, and it has no benefit, If it is necessary to cover that limb up to the root or if the decay comes, if the patient escapes by this means of death, or by malice, which is greater, the default of the limb.
if the patient escapes by this means of death, or by malice, which is greater, the default of the limb. and the limb becomes black, as if burned by fire, then the decay of the limb follows in its limb. And grasp with all your might; if you are hasty,
if it is by the bite of venomous creatures, such as scorpions of the sea and vipers and the like.
if the bite is at the head of the arm, if the wound gapes open, and does not give him space to move forward.
and if it comes up to the hand, if the wound is at the joint, so that the dislocation does not reach the arm;
And if it comes to the arm, if the shoulder blade is caught; and if it passes the shoulder blade, it is death. And it is of no use to give violent treatments except for the quantity of its virtue;
and do everything as when corrosion comes or is about to come: if it comes in the first joint, if the shoulder blade follows the other joint;
and if it comes out or is about to come out, if the shoulder blade is caught entirely; And if it [the hair] rises in the leg, if it comes to the knee joint;
and if it comes from below the knee, if there is nothing else wrong but to leave the patient dead.
and you must bind up the limb above and below with a cloth or bandage. and stretch out one minister from the lower limb, and another minister from the upper limb, And you shall uncover the bone that is between the two joints at a wide span, until the bone is exposed;
then you shall grasp or draw out the bone, and put a cushion of lint on one side so that the bone does not touch the sound tissue, and bring the patient other injury and incision.
and if blood oozes when you work, if you cauterize the tissue promptly, Or thou apply certain restraining powders; then return to thy medicine until it be accompanied.
Then bind the limb firmly with a convenient bandage, and treat it until it be healed;
and I will tell you there is one at home for now:
there was a black mark that seemed like fire,
And that decay first comes from the root of the bone, as much as it possesses the whole bone.
And when the bone has seen the decay, if it covers the bone, and is sound;
it comes back to me, the decay or the root of the hand, and it comes to an end.</start_of_turn>
and I put upon it protective things after the excision of the tumor, and I cannot stop the decay.</start_of_turn
He says that I should grasp his hand and renounce all hope of regaining the matter. I also doubt that if I cut off his hand, he will not die, because the virtue of the man is weak; and he will recover quickly and return to his home, and if he covers his hand, he will be healed;
And I have heard tell of no other fire treatment except for this one, when it is necessary.
And never comes abscess in vain, and lingers for a long time that it makes great swelling of the wound. and then it bursts and breaks, and in leaping makes the wound burst, and leaves the vessel broken; and the skin which is under is also as thin as draped cloth, And do not touch me until the bone, nor the nerve, and such diseases are called "sain."
but if it is so elongated that it reaches the bone and breaks through, it is called "fistula";
and the dressing if you bind up this wound, and even when it is subtle, like a drape. And it does not matter for its corruption.
And if you are aware that the skin is scorched, and the corruption is not in its depth, and the skin is thick with hair, if the surgeon wishes to do so:
look if there are large swellings, and that the wound stinks badly, Therefore the plaster of Egyptian medicine which is thus made: Take beeswax, oil, and pitch equally, and mix them together in one vessel over the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take according to your need, and make it into water and honey, And in loosening the shoulder, and straining the head; And leave the medicine in place for an hour and a half, then strain it out while breathing.
Do this four times, until the shoulder is relaxed and the bone is well positioned.
never with lukewarm water, When this remedy is not present, and you take handfuls of mustard seeds, and drink vinegar,
then drain, and rinse, until you are certain that the swelling has subsided.
and if the patient cannot bear it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the application of mustard seeds helps, if there is a little bit of bruised blood. or thou clistirize it of honey and wine mixed, that the honey have property of softening and washing. and the wine makes the blood dry
and when thou hast done this, and dost swear that the skin is well softened, if the blistering of that which is done makes blood appear on the surface.
And it is that you take a plaster of diaphinit, and make it with rue oil and in wine. Or you can mix it with certain medicines and unguents, of which I have spoken about the properties or treat with unguents.
and if there is a small hole in the skin, and the ointment cannot enter, if a wound is opened by a sharp object, and put in a little Egyptian unguent. or au commencement basilicon, tant que soit élargiez;
or at the beginning of the burn, as soon as it is broadened; and if the wound is too large, if the seam and it leaves too much space, the clot or pus can enter.
and if the burn hole is beneath the bone, if the brim or more is lower than it should be. for when the bone is pierced, if it does not leave a margin of flesh; And if you do not wish to cover your head with your sleeves as you see, if it appears in such a way that the bow bends lowest where it is,
and if you do not wish to cover your head with your sleeves as you see. If the limb appears in a crooked manner: let the limb bend easily forward, and leave nothing of the limb; and take consolidating medicines to put out the swelling.</start_of_turn>
and extend over one and a half inches of linen that covers the whole area.</start_of_turn and then press as firmly as forces the wound towards the outside of the body, that is to say more widely than at first.</start_of_turn After that, the sweat is often thick upon another blanket according to the quantity of blood that is lost. and put on the blood loss on the wound to align the belly, and do not remove the great blanket until after once more;
and he often sets the blood loss on the wound to align the shoulder, and sometimes this is done when the wound is infected, or if there is poison or too much swelling, or if the patient is digesting or has an upset stomach.
Et prend garde si le patient sent douleur ou non, et s’il y a un apostème ou non.
And take care if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not. if the limbs that are in the chest swell up, and the patient approaches the doctor;
and then loosen the morning or the evening, and when you loosen the wound, If the limb is changed for another bandage, and the position is renewed.
And if the limb suddenly feels sick after remaining still for a while, it is likely that the swelling has become excessive.</start_of_turn> And if subtle poisons remain long after tension has ceased, if you do not promptly restore your sanity,
because there are people who are late in their application of herbs to their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
And if it bows improperly, a sudden jump from the groin, its seeds that it does not sweat out;
and if they [the seeds] slowly depart from their usual place, and are protruded, if too many medicines that are moist in substance and dry in virtue are used, if there is an effusion of diaphines, because there is a great part of vitriol; the latter is the last medicine.
take an effusion of diaphines, and do it with rose oil, and the rose of five wine is equal in substance;
Then the fat and marrow are softened; and this itself makes honey taste sweeter and thicker. when oil is not present,

and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this cure, then the flesh is corrupted, and makes an imprint on the bone, or has stiff limbs, or has swelling; If the surgeon performs the fistula cure, as we have said before.
from the abscess of the gland.
A swelling is an abscess that arises from the swelling of the pouch of the hand, or by chance arises in other places;
And when it is urgent, and we take no heed, if it comes to an abscess, it is very dangerous. Then it is necessary to hold the abscess steady and tight until it reaches the root of the tooth; and by chance it will heal entirely
and comes the corruption up to the bone, causing great pain; and the limb becomes pale and swollen.
When you have treated it as we have said in the division, and the cure does not benefit, If it is certain that you have copied it there, do all that is superfluous that is remaining from the limb. Then cauterize the wound afterwards.</start_of_turn> The cautery is very useful when the bone is sound, and the limb is painless;
and the nail approaches the marrow, and begins to prick, and the blood flows, If you suspect that I have set the bone wrongly, do not move the limb further. and grasp firmly but gently the limb above and below.</start_of_turn> and place on the remainder of the limb medicines that are warming and corrosive to dry out all.</start_of_turn
And if the corrosion is in the bone, if the head of the bone is fractured, and the marrow is forced out, for as much as the bone is corrupted, it cannot be healed.
and if you see the bone fractured, if the head of the bone is broken as it is said before, then you must cure it as long as it is healed;
and if it is inflamed, and bloody, and if it causes great pain, if you must make it well first; Then take the hook of the sponge and cut across from below.
And guard that the cut does not reach up to the area below the hook, because the patient would feel too much pain;
and if there is bleeding, put something above which will soothe the pain.
Two joints that arise in the hands of certain people by chance are always fleshy. and by chance there is a part where there is bone, and never a nail.</start_of_turn>

The following text is a medieval medical treatise written in Old French, around the 12th-13th centuries.
The veins are large veins enclosed with fatty matter filled with black bile, which comes with many members of dark colour.
and more often in those who walk and work and carry burdens, than in others.
It is therefore necessary that you do not administer any purgatives of col, and then the remainder of the balsam.
Iron is cured in two ways: one with vinegar, and the other by burning the black blood. And thus if you tie up the vein and pull it out forcefully.
Then if you bind up the vein and pull it out forcefully. The size of this method is as follows: first pull out the hot water bag forcefully, until the bulge is no longer discernible, then stretch the limb of the patient from under the armpit down to the part below the knee; then hold the vein in one, two, or three loops, of a large size,
Then believe and command the black blood out of your hand, from the thumb to the little finger, as many times as the patient can endure; for as much as he can suffer.
And then hold it [the hand] firm, and command him to grasp a piece of meat with his black nail;
Repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and comfort the patient.
The nourishment of the limb is as follows: open the patient’s limb, if there is hair, Then he puts in the poultice or bath, and the limb becomes warm and red, and swells the veins.
If there is no bath available, if he heats the area with fire, and then holds it over the vein for a long time at the shoulder or in the lower part at the ankle;
Then he should cover the skin with fat, and massage the vein carefully from the chest downwards, until it swells up when touched.
And you will see it red and black, and when it comes out, the skin looks like a pale thread.
Then stretch the limb upwards, until it is freed from the skin, and then insert the thumb gently.
Then stretch the limb upwards, until it is freed from the skin, and then insert the thumb gently. Then support the skin over the vein until it appears, Then stretch the limb upwards, until it is freed from the skin, and then insert the thumb gently. Then support the limb at the root, as you have done before, and insert the thumb at another place, as you have done before.
Then stretch the limb upwards, until it is freed from the skin, and then insert the thumb gently. Then support the limb at the root, or several if necessary, and then insert the thumb at the end,
Then the trace and keep juice up to the second size; then draw out size by size, until it is all gone, then finish.
and if you do not pull it out and lift it, if there is a strong double thread at all its ends, tie and pull, and there will be blood at the root, and turn your hand from one side to the other, until it is gone. and keep that it does not swell, for if it swells, if we cannot pull or lift it, there will be harm to the patient;
When you have finished treating it, if you take out the foreign body from the wound, soak the limb in wine and rose oil; and cure it until it is healed.
When the limb is contracted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, So you must grasp it firmly but do not cover it; and treat it as we have said before.
So you must grasp it firmly but do not cover it; and treat it as we have said before. The form of iron from which the shoulder is made is curved, and do not cut through it, but only grasp the vein;
And it is of great concern, for if it were subtle, it would close the vein; but let it be large as we have said, and this is the form:
Of the civil vein.
This vein is enclosed in the limb, in hot parts or where there are no herbs or trees, and in the earth where there is no moisture;
and sometimes in another place except in the limb, and this comes from the corruption that comes from the decomposition that comes from the skin,
If it comes from within the body serpent-like and towards, grasp between leather and bone.
If there is a sign of swelling in this vein if there comes into the limb a great swelling, then it will swell and the vein will burst like the root of a plant.
When the limb opens, if you must cover it that you wrap around one third of its circumference with cloth, up to three fingers’ breadth, and the nail,
et laisse le plonc pendant a la jambe, et totes les fois qu’il en ist point au defuer, si l’envoloupe entor le plonc, et la nowe; and leave the scab on the limb, and every time it points towards the heel, if the surrounding tissue covers the scab, and the new growth. for if you cover it, if it returns inwards, and causes swelling and inflammation or pain, and disease;
because of that it must be treated throughout and throughout until it is completely healed, and nothing remains or remains stiff.
et est aucune fois ceste voinne quant elle est traite de cinq paumes de longueur, ou de dix. and never is this vein when treated with five fists of length, or ten.
when it is full; and either empty its contents or bring medicines inside so that there is no swelling, then cure as with abscesses.
and never is this vein like hands wide open, and even when it opens in the armpit, or at the elbow, And it comes out from the wound, and as soon as it leaps up; cure it then as we have said before.
And it comes out from the wound, and as soon as it leaps up; cure it then as we have said before.
And it comes out from the wound, and as soon as it leaps up; cure it then as we have said before
And it comes out from the wound, and as soon as it leaps up; cure it then as we have said before. And he feels very well aware of every limb, as soon as he feels the skin or it moves, and leaps up fiercely.
And he is plagued by the swelling of humors, as when they approach and become serpents and worms and lice or belly-ache;
and he doubts his malice, for when he goes through the chest and climbs to the head, and comes to the oil, then it returns by chance, and destroys the oil; and this has happened many times.
When you see it cured and treated, if it cannot be forced until it goes away:
if so, then you must tie up the limb firmly and support it with a strong thread that is tightly bound.</start_of_turn>
then pull up and treat it, and if it is pierced by the bone, and you do not find it, then burn it with fire until it dies.</start_of_turn
And the greatest harm that it makes is when it contaminates the oil, as we have said.
And if you see it coming or near the oil, immediately grasp its bristles and hold it down firmly.</start_of_turn>
and must provide the patient with nourishment of various medicines to expel the harmful humors from the body.</start_of_turn>
and must abstain from eating rotten meat.</start_of_turn
Of the pain that comes from wind-swelling This disease is called in our land "vakirir," and is a pain that comes in the joints of the limbs, and thus it moves from limb to limb; and I have seen that which I tell you.
I was called to a sick woman, and saw her arm swollen, and found a small swelling in the armpit of her arm;
And thus afterwards, the vises mount like a worm at the shoulder. more tense than anything else, like living silver when it breaks from its root
the pain departs from that root and settles in the shoulder,
and then afterwards corrected throughout the limb, until it comes to the other arm;
Then he told me that it twisted back towards the body, just as I saw it.
I wondered what he meant by that, because I had never seen such a disease in this way before. However, I must say that I do not know what to do in such a case, when pain in one limb is transferred to another but I do not know it myself, as I have seen it in a woman;
And I thought that it was for this reason that the woman had dry skin and exposed veins. and for this reason appeared that cold wind was restrained;
and did not appear to me in accordance with this reason for those who are fond of them, and who have moist skin and covered veins.
When you see the cure for this ailment, and the patient feels that pain, if it appears to you as we have said, If the limb above and below is affected, and then supports above as this wind opposes the limb, it is necessary. then burn the limb; and if you do not see it at your eyes,
if the limb is relieved of these winds, like foul pills, and slippery pills, and other similar things.
From patches.
The towels are varied, according to their appearance and according to the nature of the wound or the pain they cause.
There are various towels, some with large points, some with small points, some with bristles, and some with buttons. some with corners, and some with long handles, and some with fragments. or in the great limb it is pricked; ou en membre de dessous qui est plus proche du corps.
If the brain, head, liver, heart, arm, hand, intestine, bladder, and other members. When one suspects in any of these members, and the sign of death, which I will tell you later, will teach you: you must know that you must avoid the extraction of this stone, because death follows in many cases. and when the sign is not clear, do not trust the stone, for it does not always leave its mark, if it be broken, it will cure the wound.
And the sign of a fractured skull when the arrow pierces the bone, and jumps up the syfac which is above the skull, is when scraping and swelling and turning and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile; and sometimes without a wound of the nose or the ear; and sometimes it causes the loss of speech and voice; and sometimes with a white moist wound resembling blood clots, and also with a reddish swelling like burn;
And if this sign shows you, if you persist in your treatment, draw out the arrow if it is not entangled.
The sign of the arrow when it is pierced or hooked is that it is close to the left breast, and feels just as if it were stuck in something hard, do not make it empty. And by chance the arrow moves just like a worm, and in dark blood without, comes cold and cold sweat, and fainting: its limbs then sense doubt that death approaches.
And the sign of a wound that never heals is only without pus coming from the wound, and the swelling increases, and the patient’s complexion changes, and he sighs deeply and vomits profusely.
If the arrow tip remains in the covering of the wound, if it is removed, there is great pain and swelling, and deep sighing; and the limb moves abnormally
If the arrow tip is broken or in the stomach, by chance no sign of indigestible meat from the wound.
If the arrow tip is broken or in the stomach, and there is no sign of feces in the intestines, if there is no hope for recovery, do not attempt to extract the arrow.
And if the bladder stone passes into the bladder, and the urine spurts out and comes out forcefully, and the patient feels great pain: the wound is mortal.
The other limb, if it is fractured and the collarbone and the jaw and the shoulder and the elbow and the wrist and the forearm and the leg, and the like, is only saved by numerous precautions. When the bladder stone is in the nerve or the artery, and it is not venomous, as I have told you before, for in this case you must do something else.</start_of_turn>
There is one home remedy for this, that is a bladder stone which comes out in the armpit or in the groin. I grasped it, and on the other side I pulled out the fat of the ear, and it was sane without harm.
And pulled out a splinter that was lodged in the fat of the ear from the earwax and the splinter was whole, and only the point towards the head was visible, and was as long as a thumb, at all times facing towards the ear; the pain was gone, and there was no further discomfort.
And draw an arrow from the throat to the ear, and lo and behold, the arrow was Arabic at the ear:
And I saw the bristles, and understood as I drew it out, and lo and behold, the bristles were intact.
And drew an arrow at home, that was lying under the chin or belly, and thought it was dead;
and then that it passed three days, if it did not change its position; I cut on the bowstring, and the tendon, and the sinew, without any mishap.
And if thus be the case that a bowstring hangs or lies close to the wound, and the wound is deep;
then I must remove the bowstring from within it, and do not alter its natural position, without causing any damage to its natural works.
And thus another man, who had a wound in his face, and was stitched up;
and suffered great pain; and there were other symptoms besides.</start_of_turn>
And there was a wound in the king's face, which was very painful.</start_of_turn and was declining to the right side; and the wound was completely closed up.</start_of_turn
I flee being called to the cure after it was set for two days. If I find the wound much injured.
I wish to have it at all a subtle attempt, and I do not feel it myself; and there is no longer any sensation of pain or tingling in the nearby area. I thought that it was the tip of an arrow
I place upon the limb a plaster that is both adhesive and digestive, so that it does not swell. and I notice the limb is relieved of the wound.
and I notice the limb is relieved of the wound. I place the dressing again on the limb, and rest the wound securely, and keep the patient still for a long time,
until it feels the wound no longer causes pain; and he tells me so. I put the corrosive medicine on the wound by hand every day, until it was healed.
and held the edges still, feeling the tip of the arrow that was protruding from the flesh; then I closed the wound with that corrosive medicine, until the arrow tip became visible to me;
and remained there for about three months,
Then expand if the wound allows me to bind the thumbs, and my hand from one side to the other, and I cannot desist;
therefore I will continue to toil and devise methods of treatment, until I take hold of it, that is to say, when the thumbs are well bound, as soon as its form appears at the end of this chapter, as long as I hold it, and will restore the wound.
And they judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it immediately, and the wound was sutured, and the patient was completely healed.
Or did you say the quality of the extraction of some arrows?</start_of_turn> if you put your remedy on what I do not understand, because the books do not teach me all;
but you know masters better than me about many great things, and about what is present and lacking. Trueve neuf œuvre, et neuf instrument, au descendant des choses étrangères qui surviennent en cet art.
True nine works, and nine instruments, at the descent of foreign things which happen in this art. or by liquid or they enter, or in some other way;
and that which leaps forth because of liquid or enters, is the sacket which has been transfixed in flesh, and leaps forth never more.
And if it does not come out now, let it remain until the chariot is carried round, and rejoice in its escape.
And if it is stuck in the bone and cannot come out, if you leave it alone for some days, and move it every day;
And then it will come out, and if it does not, if you pierce around all around with a subtle instrument, as long as the limb is swollen, and then extract it.
If the scab has become stuck within the flesh and cannot be seen, if you attempt to pull it out with all your might; and if you feel it, if the thread has no convenient cover;
and if you do not manage to pull it out easily, and if the scab has gone deep; And there is no bone, nerve, or vein, if the wound is as large as the ailment. If you pull out the arrow and there is an ear in the wound, hold it so that it stays put.
If you pull out the arrow and there is an ear in the wound, hold it so that it stays put. if the bone that is pierced by the arrow is fractured from the muscle that you pull out, and break or split the ears of the arrow, as much as you can pull it out;
and break or split the ears of the arrow, as much as you can pull it out; And subtilize well that you do not break the splinter, but rather grasp it more firmly.
And if you do not do it once, if the limb remains bent inward, then grasp it firmly, for the extraction will bring relief.</start_of_turn> And if bleeding opposes you, if you accompany what we have said concerning the treatment in this chapter;
and take care of the incision of the nerve and the vein, and put in place as you must draw out the splinter without peril.</start_of_turn
Or thrust or tear, or firmly or mildly; and set the patient according to the shape he was when the arrow struck him. for this is the greatest help that can be, and if you do not know how, if you do not know what it shows you, follow what it signs to you.</start_of_turn>
The arrow that comes from another place, or it opens nothing of it, or the skin is swollen in that place if it is seen or felt at once.</start_of_turn
Thus do thus, until the nails can take hold, and then take it out: if the wound has burst now.</start_of_turn>
And if it is held in the bone, if you round your hand around it until it enters the bone, and widen the bone, then draw it out.
And if it cannot be drawn out, if you leave it hooked, and then begin the extraction again until it comes out forcefully.
and if there is a splinter of bone, if it is grasped by the forceps, hold it tightly;
and if there is a chip of bone, and you see an instrument has slipped, if it has slipped from the forceps, If the point of the arrow enters the socket of the instrument; and then draw forth forcefully,
If the arrow is firmly lodged in the socket, draw out with force, for if the point of the instrument remains embedded, it will ease the extraction.
If the arrow is surrounded, if you must, remove all surrounding tissue or the venom has spread, if you delay, then cure the wound as you deem appropriate.
If the splinter or piece of bone lies close to the skin on the belly, the breast or the side, and it is near, cover over it with your hand, if you can.
Cover the wound and the nerve, and then extract the foreign body, and then close the wound, if necessary and keep the wound clean until it is healed.
The shapes of the nails with which we treat the saiettes are similar to the beak of an oyster, and thus be the form:
And there are many ways: great, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the splinter.
From common veins do blood often flow. From common veins do blood often flow.
From common veins do blood often flow. From common veins do blood often flow. And thus with veins that are in the armpits of the eyes, which are called "aspire", and the vein that is at the brow; and the vein that is at the root of the nose; and the two armpits which are either close to the collarbone or under the arm and the veins that are on the sides of the mouth, which are called "augeherich". And thus veins that are swollen to the length.
The swollen veins that we commonly see are two in each arm:
one is the cephalic vein, which is in the left armpit, and is called the great vein; and the smallest is called the brachial, which is composed of the cephalic and axillary veins. And they call it the vein of the head, and if it is or is not stretched along the coast, And they call it the vein of the head, and if it is or is not stretched along the coast, and it is that one from which we often see, that opens visibly on the abdomen.
And the saving vein is the one that is between the thumb and the index finger, and if it is injured;
And in the limb or the heel are two veins: one if it is let go of the corbicula of the pocket of the left cost, And in the limb or the heel are two veins: one if it is let go of the corbicula of the pocket of the left cost, and the second is at the ankle of the right cost; and the vein which is called "nesse", which is in the ankle of the other cost.
And in the other limb are two veins besides those.
The blood of the veins that are behind the ears helps to remove old blood clots, and to expel foreign bodies. And the quality of the patient, as I have told you, is that you must rejoice at the head of the patient.
And the quality of the patient, as I have told you, is that you must rejoice at the head of the patient. and rejoice at the root of the vein or the vessel is rough; then stretch the patient’s neck with a hook. until the veins open behind the ears depend from the head: then do what is necessary, and if you feel the pulse of the bowels, if that be a sign of an embolism;
Then take the lancet, and pierce by weight the vein up to the bone, then hold your hand over the upper part of the vein, Then take the lancet, and pierce by weight the vein up to the bone, then hold your hand over the upper part of the vein, and grasp and loosen the skin and the vein well. It should be enough to pierce through, and make blood spurt out until you see;
Then take the lancet, and pierce by weight the vein up to the bone, then hold your hand over the upper part of the vein, and grasp and loosen the skin and the vein well. It should be enough to pierce through, and make blood spurt out until you see; then strain and ligate it, until it is healed.
And I have already said the incision and the cautery or first book.
The blood of the two temples, if it is like an ancient emigration, if it is soothed, and oily, and accustomed to swelling, and at the root of the tears it has pus;
and the quality of the physician if it is as I say. and the patient is groaning, as long as the two veins open widely; And he feels the pulse of his thumb, and then he seals it with his index finger.
then he puts his index finger on the vein at the top of his thumb, and tightens the lancet against it. and he does the same with the vein as with the others, and pulls out the blood according to the need;
then he removes the patient, and places his thumb on the vein for an hour, and then puts on cotton.
Then the sinew forms, and you must leave it as long as it remains whole; and we have spoken of it above concerning its formation and extraction, or the beginning of the book.
The blood of the front vein is worth as much as that of the cephalic vein; it has diseases of the ancient face, and migraine, and redness.</start_of_turn>
and if the patient strains his neck by twisting, until the vein bursts. then take the instrument which is called the "forceps," which is like this:
And put the point on the vein, and hold your hand firm, or something else, and let blood flow out according to the quantity you see. Then loosen the patient’s collar and bind the vein until it is firm and never again be opened with a wide flame.</start_of_turn>
However, I advise that the flame be neither too great nor too small; and the latter is better, for the bone is close, and by chance breaks the flame when it is subtle.</start_of_turn
The blood of the three veins which are in three cubits of length helps to close the wound, and to staunch the bleeding, and to give color, and to restore the face; there are diseases of the face.</start_of_turn
And if the patient strains his neck by turning his head from side to side, as before;
Then the same, and if the blood boils through, a space like a long flame and a broad space, for there is no marrow.</start_of_turn>
And if the flame is subtle, by chance if it breaks; then make an opening of the blood, as much as you are able, and then bind it up, and bind it well.</start_of_turn
The blood of the vein does not worth as much as water, and for sode, it is forced out, and for diseases of the face, If there is swelling and redness that comes to the face, and even when it is old;
and the quality of the blood if the patient stretches his neck, then strain his hand towards his left hand. take the fire slowly and long, and put it into the space between the two nostrils, for the vein does not open easily, and it will not open now;
And do not allow me to depart too soon, but stay until the blood has stopped flowing; then bind it for the night, for it is moist and will restore itself.
The blood of the veins is aided by the cautery of fire in the swelling of the veins, in the beginning of swelling, in many diseases, in haemorrhoids, in corns, in herpes, and in tumours.
When the patient’s limb is affected by the fire, the blood is driven out of its vessel by the swelling at its base. And let the master be above the head of the patient, and the patient sit on a chair.
Then let the vein be long and widely opened, and hold the blood vessel firmly, or as much as necessary;
then make the other part in the other vein, and loosen the thread, and strain all the veins moderately, so that the patient is not strangled; and leave it until morning, when the wound is healed.
Of the blood of the veins The blood of the veins from the arms above helps to clot in the mouth, and to corruption of gums, and wounds of the limbs, and dullness and pain.
And the quality of the blood is to make the patient sit before you, and restrain his neck as I have said; then open the vein, and look at the two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, And they are known by this, that they are black, and because they have small veins running black inside them. Therefore one must hold both of them still; and if you do not know them and are in doubt,
Therefore one must hold both of them still; and if you do not know them and are in doubt, if the greatest part of the chest has a swelling, and also makes two veins below and above, because this is a similar remedy.
From the veins of the tongue The blood of veins that are swollen with the tongue is of help after the blood of the cephalic vein, and this is at the widening of the throat, and has diseases of the eye, and has diseases of the mouth.
and the color of the blood is such that if the patient lies between your hands before the sun, and stretches out the tongue, and looks towards every rib, he sees a black vein
the blood does indeed flow from one side to the other, and does not rise too high, because these are the arteries.
The veins often suffer from wounds from which we commonly communicate are sound in two ways:
or if they are pierced with any sharp object, such as a flame burning brightly or a subtle olive-shaped thorn as with cuts from trenchant knives, and is called "anesil." and are wide and subtle according to the size and extent of the veins. The flame burning brightly if famous, and is wide as you see:
And must needs be to open the great veins filled with visible blood, which contain great blood and disorder. and this is the form of the olive flame.
and is more pointed, and is for the healing of the small veins, or where there is little yellow blood.
The blood of the basilisk, which is one of these veins, helps with diseases such as nausea of the throat, and cough, and pain in the belly;
And it is proper for the healer to remain calm, and to seize the artery which is below. If he seizes the artery and blood spurts out, if the healer is cautious, as I have said before. and must not be rash with the fire, but must be patient like an ass.
and if the burn does not clearly manifest itself, then you must believe that you have drawn out too much, and bind another one; or do you wish no rain from it, or do you keep in its place the vein filled in the arm: it opens immediately. and the vessel at the flame becomes silent, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
And if you see that the limb is moving, if you must stretch out the arm, touch the limb as long as you recognize the pulse; then sign the limb is dislocated, and then stretch out the arm, and hold the vein at the flame silent.</start_of_turn
And beware that you do not pierce the artery when you see the limb swell, for it is the artery: stop immediately.
And if you see it swell high like the urine of a child, and it is neither red nor limp, know that it is not an artery: stop immediately. hastenedly hold your hand over the swelling, and place your thumb along its length, then open your hand if it does not stick, for many times it has happened to me.
keep the limb still, and leave it alone; do not move the patient unnecessarily. And be careful, for there is doubt and fear, and many die.
If it is not stained and it pains, and the medicine is not present, if the artery bursts because the head is retracting, staunch it without delay.
Take a sponge of cotton wool, and put it on, and take half of it and put it on well until the other half.
If it is not stained, that is good; but if it is, as we have said, powder that stops blood.
The bleeding will not be completely stopped in many cases because of the smallness of the wound and the position of the limb.
The blood of the vein comes to aid in the treatment of blood clots that are in the chief under the jaw, and in the sides of the body. because it is composed of the basil and cephalic veins, as we have said
it is useful because it fills the cavity below the jaw, and if it is not enough, it finds the nerve, it swells up and the patient is either stifled or by chance cannot recover;
And this nerve opens many times, and if it does not open in some homes due to its subtlety, it is certain that you must remove its sensitivity from the instrument that numbs it; and take away the sensitivity of the nerve from your hand.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, if it is long enough.
The blood from the cephalic vein helps, that it pulls blood towards the head, and helps the veins;
For the blood of the left hand is not useful, because it is too far from the cephalic vein.
Whatever, it is better to inquire gently at first, and do not grieve if it does not succeed the first time, and we start again; and by chance it swells up with some people, when it does not succeed the first time, but do not grieve.</start_of_turn> The quality of the blood is according to your thoughts.</start_of_turn>
The first thing you must know about health is that blood must be conserved in order to maintain health.</start_of_turn
And to prevent future ailments; and the blood be drawn from one of the two veins which are or ought to be: namely, the cephalic, facial, or basilar; and one must administer the nourishment at the commencement of vomiting, and after meals, when the sign of repletion appears;
and one must administer the nourishment the first or second hour, after twelve or twenty-four hours.
The blood that is administered for diseases has no definite measure, but when necessary is in proportion to the degree of urgency in all hours and at all times.
and it is not permitted to give blood to children under the age of 123, nor to women who have been menstruating for more than four months up until the seventh month Blood should not be given to those who have passed 60 years of age
And when anyone feels faint, in whatever way, if it is known that they have a lesser fistula, If there is a mouth of madness retained, so that the veins do not draw intestines from the excessive humors borne by the principal members;
if there is a mouth of madness retained, so that the veins do not draw intestines from the excessive humors borne by the principal members, do not allow too much meat, neither that which is rotten, for it is fierce, nor hydrops.
and if you wish to be cured after a violent passion, vomiting, and discomfort of the belly, and multiple trips to the bath, and sleeplessness, and weeping and groaning, and all the goodness, or by some weapon or poison;
then subtile the humors, if you are able, with food and drinks and medicines, if you are able to afford them;
Then enter the bath, if nothing hinders, to subtilize the blood.
and keep the vein open from the root up to the third part, as we have said before
and take care of the work, of the point, of luxury, and of other things like that;
and be bound and joined, and let the blood be higher than it should be, and wipe the hands once or twice.
Then it is strange that the limb hangs limply downwards, for when it is too tight or loose, it cannot be corrected without;
and then the hand grasps the limb, until the veins swell and are felt.</start_of_turn>
then moisten the skin with a little oil, and put the thumb of your left hand on that vein below the limb so that the limb becomes stronger.</start_of_turn so that the vein does not break and cause injury.</start_of_turn> For there are veins that run as quickly as strings to the physician, and if some of them are filled with windiness, if when one puts on the flame, if one takes it away again, and cannot open the vein, then one is in this case.</start_of_turn>
and if it bursts the vein, if the wound is too great, because of this one must advise the physician in these matters.</start_of_turn>
And if the vein bursts the first time, that is good; but if not, one must repeat the process again until the swelling subsides.
And if the limb is inflamed and the patient is dejected, let him rest for a day or two, and do not bind the arm. Then, in such a case, there will be swelling; do not enter or bathe, and then restart the bleeding when it stops
If the wound is small, or if there is doubt that there will be enough blood to staunch the wound, do not hesitate to cauterize the wound directly over the flame;
and the work must be done carefully, even if the limb is inflamed; for this often happens when the wound is small.
If you see the limb swollen, do not immediately renew the bleeding, but apply a pad of lint soaked in oil, because it softens the blood and is held in this limb by the oil.
and in this way administer the oil-soaked lint to staunch the flow of blood, so that the blood vessels may remain closed.</start_of_turn>
this also makes the limb tremble and swell, when it is applied to the limb; if it is left on for too long, it will split apart.</start_of_turn>
and if there comes a large abscess, which has happened many times, even when the vein is only slightly damaged, or the incision is small, If you hurry, put on the wet sponge and a little charcoal on the wound, and hold it for an hour.
And remember that you must do this after the evacuation of blood from the vein, and if it remains in place after a few days, no blackness or greenness, if it does not harm me; and if you see it, put nothing of aloe or mastic resin in juice of calamus, mustard, or the like.
And often there is swelling and appearance of blood in the armpit: put your hand there, and if you feel the limb soft under the compression of the hand, if that is the bad appearance. Leave me alone; do not place anything further on that which we have already said, for by chance in court without an artery; but make it thus: apply pressure dry to endure the wound, then treat it with another remedy, until it is healed.
And take each wound according to the quantity of its virtue, and of the color of the wound.</start_of_turn>
For if it is dark without, if you leave it as long as it is red; and if you see it large, if you leave it as long as it is subtle; and if it is too thick, if you leave it cool.</start_of_turn
And it is proper for the blunt and strong, and for those who have the mastery of blood extraction, to make the wound larger and the flame wider;
and for the weak, do the opposite, make it healthier rather than worse, and must do so by cutting across, not by pricking.
and this method of bleeding is useful for the evacuation of blood and the compression of nerves, and is worth more than if the blood were long but not wide.
And for him whose body needs blood, it is proper to give soft bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is exhausted, two or three times.
And if it is of cold complexion, if you mix beforehand with blood clotted in olive oil, or in aromatic olive oil with spices, if like pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves, and fragrant oil.
And if it swells with blood, after the issue of moisture of blood, if it is expedient that it be treated with charcoal, and fragrant oil subtile.
and use other things that we have said in the division or chapter of fainting, for the evacuation of the vein.
And if it sees the arm going pale again, and is well another time, if expedient, when it is full of great blood, that it recover itself and recover itself, according to the quantity of its continuous virtue.
And whoever has seen his arm swollen after the first bleeding, and has stiffness, if he is well, should wait at least thirteen hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever has seen himself well in other parts, if he must be well again, should wait at least two days or three days.
For there is much blood in the limb that is already swollen, which causes fever; if you can drain away a great quantity, and expand the opening as much as it bleeds; Then you must not drain out the blood more than is necessary, otherwise it will not heal. And this often occurs when the patient is negligent;
and you must not think that I am blind when you see him loosen his arm, and do the same thing a second time, for the wound is closed, and you must press firmly upon it. if it is crooked, extend the arm widely, because that would be bad;
but leave it as long as it remains stable a second time; or you should touch the tip of the flame, until the blood that is frozen at the wound comes out, And put upon it a little of oil and press lightly.
And if the vein has fled, if you leave it and do not restrain me, until the swelling is gone.
And if necessary is to draw out blood a second time, if the same in this limb or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the arm is saved in place of the vein of the head for this reason that it is composed.
And thus with the blood, if the patient grasps his hand in warm water, so long as the foam is red;
then it must be bound firmly, so that the vein opens easily, and let it remain so for a while.</start_of_turn>
and let the hand remain in warm water until the blood has clotted sufficiently;
but if it swells up, do not remove the hand from the water, for more is risked thereby.</start_of_turn>
And the blood of this vein is more precious than all the others, for there is no artery or nerve.
The blood of the right forearm is worth for all diseases of the liver, and that is the manner:
strain the hand, and immerse it in hot water, until the vein is freed, if we see it. and if the limb is sound throughout, and you grasp it with all your might, if it does not grieve you;
And do not fear too much, for the nerves are all loosened from their sheath.
Then reattach the limb quickly, if it is not frozen in the wound, and do not move it.</start_of_turn>
And when you have treated the blood as a skilled physician, if you put oil and lint on the wound to stop bleeding, and do this diligently.</start_of_turn
The blood in the left hand is worth the disease of a mouse, and do everything as I have told you regarding the wound.</start_of_turn
The blood of the armpit is worth for all diseases that are in the chest, The blood of the armpit is worth for all diseases that are in the chest, such as maladies of the marrow, retention of flowers, diseases of the reins, and ulcers and old wounds, and similar diseases.
And the quality of this blood is that if the patient has been suffering from acute pain in the chest and has rubbed over the belly until it turns pale, and the belly is pale, and there is discharge of urine from below the joint of the arm; and the veins are swollen from the elbow downwards with much urine.
Healthy the joint is neither too dry nor too wet, but in the middle.
And if you keep it healthy on the bone, if you ward off the nerves that are dry, and keep it moist like when you are grasping; and let the flame be gentle.</start_of_turn>
And if it cannot be moved without pain, if you reset the bone in the water, and let the vein drain well.</start_of_turn
And if you must do it a second time, because the first attempt was salty; Do not doubt the nerve, as we have said, and do the same on the other side equally.
The groin of the sciatic nerve is at the ankle of fire, and its blood is worth the pain of the hip, when it is for blood that has clotted.</start_of_turn>
And its quality of blood is if the patient lies or sits, and is strained below the ankle three times two, twisting.</start_of_turn
for otherwise it does not open; and if it does open, if the same happens in all the ways that you can, and through the body. It is better to leave the hair as it is, for it is strong and easily replaced by hand.
It is better to leave the hair as it is, for it is strong and easily replaced by hand. If you do not manage it, if some rain falls from the sky or the wind blows, towards the little toe, and you are careful of the nerves;
then do as much as you can to stop the bleeding, and then loosen the ligature, and put on cotton wool; it is now healed.
Vacuum therapy.

And for this reason, I do not fear it, as when we draw blood from a vein. And therefore I do not fear it, as when we draw blood from a vein; and it is not to be administered with any fire or heat, in any disease that comes from congestion, until all the humors are evacuated.</start_of_turn>
And if by necessity of a disease it is necessary to administer it, or by custom, if the medicine is given at the beginning of the month or at the end, and if you mix it with honey and every ten days.
because there are some who, when they must vomit, have a heavy head;
And if such ones have swelling and redness on their face, and on their head, and at the neck, and under the eyes;
and those who have blood in their mouths, and have lost their tongues, and vomit blood. and if such ones think, and see by blood and sweat and urine and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and indeed when it is wet and moist, we command the patient to abstain from food for two hours.
The blood of the physician helps with the pain of the head … that comes with these eyes, and it cannot be stopped until after the evacuation of all the lymph.
except when this emptying is in place of the cephalic blood,
except when it is used by someone with a cold complexion or who has chatharre, for this causes them great suffering;
and for this reason it must be used cautiously, only in those who have or suffer from cold fevers.
And if he who is well is made aware of the danger, he must promptly put the ventouse one place further down on account of the fear of danger.
The suction cup is at the nape of the neck instead of the blood vessels, and for this reason it is worth expanding to the utmost extent. and concerning the fissure of the windpipe, and the swelling, and the distension;
and must be pressed, for if it is held too tightly, it causes obstruction of the throat or the stomach or the chest.
The windsings cause as much pain in the chest as at the root of the teeth, and swelling, nausea, and strangulation, and pain at the base of the teeth.

The winds of the spleen are a disease that comes from heat and fullness.
The winds of the spleen are just as much a cause of disease as two veins of the arms, because it draws blood from these large veins;
and commands the patient not to fear too much pain, because it is normal, and knows nerves and arteries.
The wound on the buttocks is so severe that it causes swelling of the underlying tissue, and diseases of the bones; it is therefore necessary that the suction should be large and strong, and have a good grasp; and in case it should slip, it will cause great damage.
The wounds of the thighs are so painful that they draw blood from all parts of the body, cause ancient pains of the groin, and swelling of the belly and testicles; and lead to the loosening of bones; and are in consequence of these three sophenes and two dislocations, and all these things loosen the body after a long time, and cause vomiting in various positions.
The way to apply the suction is to put it on empty first, and then gradually add tension, and put it on firmly, and move it equally, and do not stop doing this until you see the flesh red and swollen, and see the colour of the blood; then let go, and put the suction back on, and take care of the position of the body, for there are some who have a bad temper and are clumsy: if you should only wound once, you will cause great wounds and deep wounds; and do it cautiously.
If it is not large, it can be wounded three times: the first time to open the great vein.
If it is not large, it can be wounded three times: the first time to open the great vein. And if its veins swell with blood, it is sufficient to do so once.</start_of_turn>
If its veins swell with blood, if we repeat this too often; and if its flesh is thick, if it is perceived to be pierced, then it must be left alone.</start_of_turn>
and it is appropriate for those who have thick skin and tough flesh, who have wide pores, to apply poultices of essential oils that are aperitif and dissolving.</start_of_turn If it is thus, with oil of violet, or sweet almond oil, or oil of squash seed;

and it is advisable to give no meat at all during a draft, neither pork nor poultry, before or afterwards, in order to comfort the main parts of the body. or be discreet about it, but do not let anyone know who is sick;
The wounds which are made to bleed are those which are made upon the liver, and upon the spleen, and under the heel, and upon the belly and the bowels and the veins and the anus, for in these members there is no wound which does not suffer from bleeding.
and they are made only to draw blood from a limb to a limb, for if we put them on the limbs when we do not need to draw blood; because of the viscosity which is in the limb, as when we put compresses on the belly and the bowels to make the limb easier.
and it removes the pain, when there is swelling or a fracture, for it removes by its attractive virtue the swelling, or expels the fracture from its place;
And thus he must elevate it when one places it upon the liver and upon the spleen when there is retained wind.
These winds are administered empty so soon as they are required; and never are they administered together with fire, and never are they plain with cold water.
if there are diseases of the pleura, and in such a manner we fill the wound with hot water, or water, or where there are herbs that cover this.
The form of the wound administered with fire is as follows:
And there were two palms and a half of barley and there was either cost the entrance to a thousand with a little hole, like when pushing out an arrow.
Or it be from rain, sweat before if it does not bleed the patient at the putting on the limb.
and there was in the middle a twig of thorn or iron, to put on a bandage wound,
and there were great and small according to the maladies and the degree of those who take them;
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
And one must put this swelling on the limb:
grip the bandage of silk or linen, and put it through the hole that is in the middle of the swelling, If the burn is at the bottom of the cup and does not burn the patient.
Then put it on the limb and support it as we have said; if you see that the vapor is going up, take away the cup immediately.
and hold the dressing as before, and do it often, if you must.
In the ventouse, when it is administered for a pleural effusion, at all times, there is no bulge or opening, and is administered only when it is filled with liquid, and is placed on the limb only for a short time;
And thus is the shape:
The veins are not to be tied down except in members where it is impossible to apply a tourniquet because of their small size, such as the liver and the spleen, and similar things. and in the bones stripped of flesh, as in the case of bone or marrow, and other similar things;
and the quality of the liquid if it is that when you find veins that are soft and smooth in sensation, take them;
And put a nut in boiling water, until they are soft, and do not have anything in their stomachs. Then either wash the vein and the belly, then rub the limb until it is red, and put on the bandage.</start_of_turn>
When they are full and warm, and soft, if it is possible to put on a suction cup, put it on, for this is better afterwards.</start_of_turn>
If this is not possible, if you lift the limb easily, and then with water, moist well, and then press it.</start_of_turn
And if the limb is too late after the bath of cold water, if much, i.e. a cloth of linen in cold water, put on, until the limb is stretched out;
And if the limb is too long, if put on broken glass or nails, and similar things, until it is stretched out.
or you take half of a pea and leave it on the limb until it burns, if it is stopped now;
and if you have more pain, take other baths.
And if the wounds do not take hold, if you rub the limb with fresh blood, or if you insert a needle into it until the wound is closed, and then keep them in place, as long as they feel the blood flowing; otherwise they will burst open.
and when you see that they are bleeding, if you sprinkle powder on a wound of aloe and wool gauze, or charcoal, if they will now be quiet.
This is the end of the text.
This chapter is frequently necessary in the art of medicine, and is restoration of fracture and displacement.
Listen well, dear son, for this chapter is not found in any of the ancient books, nor is it mentioned in any letter
because in our land I have never found anyone who has known it;
I know of nothing about it, except what I have learned from the ancient books, or from having studied it myself, by experience, and from observing it in my life
And thus I have described in this chapter what is contained in it, and I have abbreviated at the end, and I have made clear the forms of the instruments which are mentioned, as I have done in the preceding chapters.
It is therefore necessary that we say or prologue of this book contains the sum of the word and the chapters or the learned men put their understanding into it, and remain on the truth, so that those who are proved to know learn this noble art and learn from others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twist or swelling comes to any, if you must quickly heal the patient on one side and on the other, if nothing else hinders, if weakness of the limb, or infancy, or old age;
If the head of the shoulder is not too taut or too loose; and eat cold broth, such as cold juices, and cheese and herbs, and do not drink wine, eat no fatty foods, and do not eat too much meat which fills the veins of blood; until you have certainty of complete healing, neither swelling of the limb. If the patient returns to normal before the first sign of recovery, he must be given a fresh order.
And when the bones are broken and begin to heal, if it is known that the patient must not be given meat that causes great swelling, or if there is viscosity, as with flour mixed with water, and rye, and peas, and beans, and fish, and wine, and other things like these. For part of the swelling subsides when the bone is more solid and the fracture is more stable.
And know that bones that are fractured in various ways do not mend well, neither by themselves nor by soldering according to their nature because of the dryness of the limbs; neither are those which are too brittle, like bones of small children.
But there is no cure, hold tight to the fractured bone, that is, strong tension which has occurred and unites the limb together, until it is firm as it was before; do not move it at all, and for this reason it is recommended to nourish with coarse food, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
And know that fractures are of various kinds in many ways.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow. For there are breakages that go to the marrow, and others by cutting, as with the size of a pen for writing.
For there are breakages that go to the marrow, and others by cutting, as with the size of a pen for writing. And if there is a breakage with a wound, and a breakage with a small tear.
And at the shoulder blade there is its engine, and its own instrument in restoring, according to what it remembers from its place.
and is known by the breaking of the bone by that which its blood is clotted, and opens well by force, and some by pressure of the hand.
and when there is no swelling nor pain, the patient does not feel great pain, if there is no break;
but it can well have swelling, or fracture, or small break. If it is not possible for me to do anything but move the hand, but put on medicines that come after this, and then hold it now discreetly.
If the swelling that is bursting goes downwards, and is the junction of these two parts of the joint, it must now be put back in place evenly, so that the abscesses remain alive;
and if the abscesses come, if you leave them without care, as long as the abscesses are calmed; then put it gently and steadily in place, and the swelling that has burst will be more easily restored than if it had been pulled out or fractured; and then hold it now discreetly.
And if there are broken bones within the bone, if they extend from the thumb to the wrist, or to the hand, or if it is a small limb, or to the elbow, or to the wrist;
put the limb in its natural position, so that when the fractured parts of the limb are unbound, if you rejoin them at their natural level, and keep that in your work does not cause the patient any further pain or injury.
and well support the fractured bones according to the best shapes.
And he feels well in the hand if it seems to him that it is not well: if the swelling is beautiful, and does not constrain him too much, do not press so much as they do who make it come about by their work at incisions and contractions of the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is fixed, if the patient is very painful that he does not move it, neither watching nor sleeping, neither turning nor in any other way; keep it very steady that he does not feel any pain. For when he feels no pain, if it is not at a point, and you command him to put himself in a posture where he feels no pain;
For when he feels no pain, if it is not at a point, and you command him to put himself in a posture where he feels no pain; and keep him steady that he does not suffer further pain when you restore him.</start_of_turn>
and that you consider the limb to be broken as I have told you.</start_of_turn>
The limb is broken in various sizes, shapes and forms.</start_of_turn>
For in such small limbs, as arms and legs and the like: if you cover them with soft linen cloths and blankets;
For in such great limbs, as hips and thighs: if you cover them with a broad and hard cloth, because the large cloth embraces the whole great limb and restricts it everywhere, so that there is no bulge.
Then tie loosely around the limb, twice or thrice according to the size of the limb, and hold the hand one inch above the break and strain less, than the break itself breaks and lets go one inch of the break;
and soften the cloth somewhat, so that you take a great part of the limb again, then take another cloth, and turn the dressing around the limb;
Then draw towards the lower part of the break, and hold moderately, not too strong nor too weak, as we said earlier.
Then put between the layers of skin some strips of linen or cloth, so that they are all even, and then bind all around with thread, and then put your stitches well made above, if there is no abscess or swelling.</start_of_turn>
And if there is an abscess or swelling, if put above something soothing the abscess burn, and which strengthens the swelling, and leave it so for several days.</start_of_turn
Then strain above your stitches, and let them be half the width of a broad needle resting steadily, or of thread from which we make knots, or of hemp ropes, and let them be as follows:
But it must be known that when one sets the bone in place which has a fracture, it must be a larger and wider break than the others.
and be of equal length as it ought to be for the limb in general or for its size.</start_of_turn>
then is strained upon the bones just as you did at the first hour, and then bind it loosely with a thread as before the fracture;
more is tight is bound, the less; and it must be known that the thread must be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and must be of linen wool.</start_of_turn>
For if the threads are thick, as I often see fools do who bind their wounds with linen thread, it is a great error, for the thread will not be even if it is too fine, and it will hold only if there is less space between the stitches.
And if the patient is bruised by the threads after the stripping in the flesh, if you put soap on them, I put coarse linen or coarse cloth on them, so that they do not bleed.</start_of_turn>
When the wound is with a wound-cleaner and the bone is fractured, I will speak of the cure for it later.</start_of_turn>
And so, if it cannot be forced out by hand, grasp the broken limb first thing. For when the limb is large, it cannot be forced out by hand except after five or seven days, or more according to the severity of the wound; for the wound often comes out before the bone is healed.</start_of_turn>
and thus, with this old method of packing, to restore fracture, dislocation, and torsion: take flour that is held fast as the walls of a mill, and mix it with abundant eggs, and make this confection, not too fine nor too coarse, and use it. This is the common method of restoring the fracture in many situations, and even among women and young children, for it is neither too tight nor too loose.</start_of_turn
Another method of packing that restores the fracture and dislocation and torsion: take three barley, linseed, laurel, asafoetida, gum arabic, mugwort, and mix them with an egg; mix mirra and aloes with a third of an egg; mix alechil with eight eggs; and grind them all together; if the patient’s complexion is hot, use this packing, for it is of good composition and restores the broken bones quickly, and is worth more than many homes.</start_of_turn>
Other means of supporting that is worth torsion: take mugwort and vismut, mix with vinegar three times; mirret and aloe, mix with vinegar eight times three; acaice five times three; arnica ten times three, and grind well, and confit with water or plenty of eggs, and administer.
Other means of supporting that is worth torsion: take mugwort and vismut, mix with vinegar three times; mirret and aloe, mix with vinegar eight times three; acaice five times three; arnica ten times three, and grind well, and confit with water or plenty of eggs, and administer.
Other means of supporting that is worth torsion: take dried fig tree leaves and terrestrial poppy leaves, grind together, and make a plaster.
Other means of restoring the fracture of the bone and removing the remaining abscess. Take root of vismalve, chamomile, violets flowers, wheat flour, one part of rue; grind and mix with wine, and if the limb is swollen, mix with moist coriander water, or water alone, and use.
Other means of setting is more violent for the first one, when the abscess hardens at the restoration of the limb. Take root of vismalve, flaxseed, balsam, melilot, violets and chamomile flowers, all in equal parts; grind and mix with salt water, or sweet water, or wine, according to the heat of the limb and its rest.
Hippocrates in his book does not put anything on the broken limb to restore it except some wax and oil, and nothing else, and he says that it should be between two not too soft not too hard.
And it seems Galen suggests that we must put something dry and warm on the limb to restore it, such as mirre and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another way of dressing that is useful for wound and pain: take mugwort and chopped onions or fennel, and balsam, and mix them evenly, and grind them, and make a dressing of them.</start_of_turn>
And then loosen a little afterwards, and take care that the patient does not feel any pain, nor has any movement of his limb; if you do not loosen it by hand for a while.</start_of_turn
If pain comes to the limb, or swelling or itching, if you rush and loosen it, and put the limb in place now; take a lighter bandage, a sponge of moist sea-moss, and immerse in water, and lift the limb up, until the itching stops and the pain is calmed. Then let the limb rest for an hour, and put on dry cloth, soaked in water or rose oil, and tie on a bandage, until you are certain of the healing of the wound
Rest the inflamed limb, and if there is pain, then rejoin the bandage and a little support, and do not bind too tightly; and take care until it is healed.
If you see swelling, redness, pain, and swelling around a bone, and if the pain persists, you must support and bind it firmly, just as you did the first time.
If it does not happen in the limb what we have said, if it does not loosen up within two or three or five or seven days; do not leave it for twenty days, as we have seen, until the swelling has gone down, and approach the closing of the wound slowly.</start_of_turn>
Therefore more restraint than before, and soak the meat, as I have said before; and if you see the limb dry out more than usual, do not attempt to pull out the swelling; Arose, alors, que tu le deslies, qu’il fasse chaud de l’eau chaude, toutes les fois que tu le fais, et ce soit chez quiconque tiers, et fais-la susciter un peu la corde.
When you loosen it, then, that it makes warm water, every time you do it, and this be it with any third person, make it stir up a little the thread. For by this work, indeed, it often happens that it returns to its place the limb, and this is bad, and if the work is rough, and I see nothing else but to leave it and do it violently.</start_of_turn>
of various ways of breaking. Many are the ways of fractures, and various figures, and the causes are diverse.
For there are fractures caused by the percussion of a spear, and the collar of the bone is fractured throughout to the syfosis which is the socket of the bone, as if made by a chisel or fist; and for this reason it is called this kind of fracture "haichure".
Or if the spear pierces the bone from the outside inwards, and is called this kind of fracture "absolue"; and is the wound of these great or small fractures.
And if there is embedded percussion, or fracture or dislocation of the bone, or fracture of the nail or other similar things.
And if there is a burst fracture, which approaches the gut that is beside the bone, or it is on the bone, and is this wound great or small.
And if there is a wound that is closed in the bone as subtly as a hairpin, and the fracture is small, and for this reason it is called a "capillary" fracture.
And if there is a wound made or by cutting with a knife, or by thorn, or by anything similar, and it lets a piece of bone go down into the gut, and the limb becomes as limp as if it were hung over a cauldron; if there is something between the bones.
And this often happens with soft bones or those of children;
And there are many such breaks in these ways that small pieces are detached from them as in stars; and I will speak of them in detail.
And we know of all these breaks by the loosening above them, by the incisions of the tents, and by the corrupt flesh that is above.
The like of hair is known by that which when one has discovered the bone, and has wiped over it, if the black break is opened.
In the treatment of the break, take care of the patient’s ailments, and if you see no bad accident, such as vomiting of bile, emission of understanding, extension, and swelling, and fever, and the eyes watering and reddening, and other similar things in greater or lesser degree, if it does not sense without doubt.
And if you do not see any imminent mishap, and you hope for health, if so, begin the treatment.
And when the swelling first comes to you, and it is in the armpit, if so, you must remove the bone in front of the wrist from the joint that you must put in place.</start_of_turn>
And if it is in this state, if you hasten to remove the bone in front of the elbow, so that the bone of the limb is corrupted, then comes the accident that we have said.</start_of_turn>
And if the bone breaks as far as to cover the brain, if so, you must make an incision in the wound so that you can see: and take hold of the patient’s head and uncover the bone in every way that you can, and on the figure of the wound more roughly than you can.</start_of_turn
And if blood comes out with the uncovering of the bone, or with an abscess, hold fast to what is useful and fill the wound with soft cloth soaked in rose oil. And keep the abscess quiet until the bone is finally stable, and be sure there is no further bleeding; then begin to close the wound. This is done in two ways: the first way is if the wound is narrow at the front, and this is the form:
And then there is another wound that is greater than the first.
And so if you have various sized swellings, some are thin and others are thick, and they are pointed or iron-like; and on their lower parts, do not touch the head.
And if the bone is thick and tough, if you must pierce through, even if you administer swellings with poultices, do not make them go beyond the test of the bone; and must have beneath the point a margin or circle, which does not allow the point to pass beyond the bone; and you must do this several times, for if pieces of bone come to lie in the place of the thickness of the bone, because of the poultices you must give for the test. And this is the form of the two methods of poultices.
The quality for piercing through the brittle bone is that you put on one poultice over the bone, and twist your two hands until you feel that the bone is pierced; then put on another poultice in another place a little later, and do the same all around; then close the incisions of the space between the perforations, and do this more subtly than you could, and lightly, as we have said, until you have brought the bone to your hand, or to any other instrument that you have like nails, pincers; and keep your hand away from the brain and the jaw.
And when you have grasped the bone firmly, and treated, if it is possible, reset the apurture which is loosened from the bone to all other instruments that resemble an incisor, but it must be more tense and flexible than the other incisor.
And if it leaves nothing of the small bones, no nails, if the bones are slightly fractured; then cure the wound with sutures and bandages as we have said.</start_of_turn>
And another method of treatment is like the Galen method, which is more useful; and the load is very strong, and that is his word.</start_of_turn> It is necessary first that you uncover a part of the bone, either by fracture or by displacement of muscle, so that when you have uncovered that part, you must place the thumb of your injured finger against the flesh, as it is formed:
Do not cut from one side only, and if the part is rough in the marrow, if you cut towards the bone; then fix with a little mallet above, so that you can slightly bend the bone all around, and take care of the membrane that is below.
if it is tough against the bone, if the bone is slightly bent, because we must well sense the pain and fear.
And if the bone breaks but does not pierce the skin, the bone is simply cut through from above; and there are small pieces remaining. If you wish to remove the rough edges, you must have various quantities of the blunt rasp available, so as to smooth each piece according to the work and the figure of the break.
If there are before great rasps, and afterwards more subtle, and you do not cease doing this until it is well done.</start_of_turn>
In some other capillary and subtle breaks, it is necessary to provide the cause according to its situation; and this is something that is not easily learned by anyone who has not thoroughly studied this art.</start_of_turn>
And if the face is discovered, take one drape of linen, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it on the wound. Then take another drape of linen doubled in half or in quarters, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first drape; and do this more gently than you please, that you do not damage the face, then administer from above another linen, and do not bind it more tightly than is necessary to hold the wound steady only
and leave it thus for one or two hours, until the swelling of the abscess is diminished, then take it off, and administer medicines such as root of chamomile, flour of barley, incense powder, and herbs; and from these things make a powder, and put it on the wound, and administer accordingly appropriate medicines with a pleasant taste.
And beware that the wound be perfectly closed, that thou leave it neither open nor reassembled with a bow, for when a bow is reassembled upon the head of the cerebrum, if it be crooked and firm, it brings great harm to the patient; for when one sets upon it any biting thing, if it is not held down by something else.
Take heed, therefore, if no other mishap befalls the patient, as we have said, if there be doubt concerning it.
And if no other force comes forth from the medicine which we have set upon, that some part of virtue has, if you must take, a part of honey, and two parts of rose oil and glue one drapel; and put it upon the surface. Then comes the treatment in the manner of cures that it is allowed, as long as it is sane.
Then comes the treatment in the manner of cures that it is allowed, as long as it is sane.
And if one of the two parts is broken, if it is possible, to drink a little wine or extract from the bone, and put equal pressure on this fracture within your index finger and thumb, as long as it does not return to its natural figure. and do it gently, and beware that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the limb, and cannot come from below, if you can, put the limb even with the top of a thick stick.
And if the fracture is three-fourths of the way up, if you make another, and hurry to restore the limb first, if you can;
if this is not done, after the seventh or eighth day, when the swelling of the limb has subsided, then you must try to bandage the limb, if the fracture is in the limb itself
Or you must break it again somewhere else, if the fracture is there; and be as strong as you can in your attempts to fill the hole in the limb.
And they say no restorer must moisten the tents in the burrow, and must die each one for himself. It does not seem to me that this is good, but it must be that they are moistened in the making of an egg-bread and flour; then leave the tent until the bone is firm and the cartilages are hardened.
Never put feathers of a goose instead of tents, and if there is any soft drape about, and if you keep the pincer, and blow on the patient among them; or do as you will see.</start_of_turn>
And if pus comes out while you are working, if you put some lint or cotton soaked in rose oil, or in some linseed oil.
And if the afterpains do not come, if you put on a plaster by force, of hempseed flour, and incense powder, confirmed with the yolk of an egg, then put on soft bandages, and do not bind tightly;
And if the fracture does not break through, and it is broken into many pieces, if you have available instruments, then draw out the fragments, and suture the wound, and treat with healing herbs, and oil, as with plasters and bandages available.
And if there is no swelling in the wound, if you can cure with stitches, and put on cold compresses, as long as it is necessary.
Of the route of the mandible.
When the mandible is routed downwards, and there is no wound, and the fracture is only slight, and is not broken thoroughly, except for the curvature inwards, if one knows it lightly.
It is necessary, if the fracture is in the outer part, to bite down with the thumb of the affected hand in the mouth of the patient; and if the fracture is in the left mandible, if you take the thumb of the right hand, and grasp the fracture lightly, and hold it apart with the other hand, and keep it even.
And if the fracture of the mandible is displaced in .ij., if it is necessary to administer extension of .ij. parts, as long as they are even.
If movement of the teeth causes pain, or a fracture, if they are strained by a thread of gold or silver or silk, then put a broken jaw cerate on and put over it a double drape; and put over the drape a large staple well made, or a piece of leather equal in length and width to the jaw, and bind it to the muscle as you please, and command the patient to rest and eat lean meat.
If you see that the figure is deformed, if the bone is fractured at the third part, and then reset it to its place; then put on a plaster cast, of pounded powder with much egg or oatmeal, after you have set the cerate; and put on the plaster clean linen, and if the plaster is loose, and the patient’s condition does not worsen, leave it as it is until it heals; many times it heals in two weeks.
And if the patient has a wound that comes open, if we have already said many times what we have said.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, award that no part of the bone is fractured; if slight of the bone has escaped, cover it with something that covers it.
And if the wound is severe, if the swelling has gone up with flame as you desire.</start_of_turn>
And when you have united all these parts, and there is no longer any displacement, if the wound is large, put on some dressings that cover it, in order to prevent suppuration, as long as it is necessary.</start_of_turn>
forcefully</start_of_turn> The strong force breaks several times before, over the shoulder, and if it breaks in two manners: when it is broken and loosened in four places, and there are fragments, and that is the lightest to restore; or if there is a break with a wound.
And if the break is when the wound faces downwards, take two assistants, so that one holds the limb where the force breaks; and the other extends the neck towards the part; then set the break even, so that the form is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor swelling
And if you must extend further, put under the shoulder of the patient a round ball of lead or linen, and be large as you need; and stretch and hold the forcele, and strain the ball with your hand, so that you set the break even, as it should be.
If you do not manage to support the head of the shoulder, when it comes out of place, if you must know, the patient lies supine on his belly, and place the shoulder blade between the nipples, and keep the minister there until the bone of the shoulder is raised.
Then address the fracture to your side, and if you find debris there, if you must know, make an incision there; and force out the pieces gently, and if the bones cannot join together by any means, if the socket is at one of the incisors you have; but that you place between the shoulder blade and the breast bone this instrument to keep the wound open.
It appears like a spoon, and is not crooked, and should be as wide as it seems necessary, according to the size of the bone and the position of the work; and has two holes, as you see, and one is large, and the other is small, as is the course of the wound that you made when you treated the bones;
And when you are assured of the afterburn, if the wound is small, or if you doubt the afterburn, if you use a bandage and pins according to their quantity.
And if the afterburn comes, if it is moist, apply oil of roses, rue and wine, and put on top.</start_of_turn>
The stiffness of the bone, when it has wounds and is swollen, is that you put on the bone the plaster of the meal of wheat flour and egg yolk, and put on stockings loosely, and put a splinter below the armpit if you must.</start_of_turn Then take a very great bandage of a palm of a broad size, and put two layers of drapeil over the wound and cover it; then take a needle of the thinnest kind of two sizes broad and long, and encircle that bandage, so that the head of the bandage is pendant. Then put the needle on the bulge, and turn the bandage on the collar, and drain the liquid from the wound, and drain the wound from the painful side; and hold the edges apart, and when you see that the ligature holds the bulge steadily, and you clearly see that the needle does not move from the broken bone, if you reward generously, and if you restrain them.</start_of_turn>
Then make the patient lie on his back, and put under him one little pillow to support the wound; if you align the break of the arm with the alignment of the shoulder, or you bind the arm to the collar, and do not release it until it is well healed, for about twenty days.
Then resume the traction, if you see that it is necessary, and hold and leave it thus until it is restored; and it is restored in about twenty-six days, and in less time to any home.

And if a piece of the bone bends forward, and does not yield at all, if it persists, and the bone, make do with the forceps to subdue the abscess at its source.

The bone is never broken in the middle, but this often happens; but it often breaks from excessive force. And when it is broken in two, if it declines to yield, and the patient feels great pain, and has no other remedy, then vomiting blood, and opening the wound in the broken bone, and the like.
And the restoration is that if the patient lies soven on his back, and puts one cushion between the scapulae, then press the scapulae and assemble the ribs of the two costae with your hands, and gently put everything in its place as it should be; then put on bandages and bandage the outside of the bone with fine salt, or some other soft matter, and cover with a cloth, and bind the whole thing around the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the patient slowly on his back, and strain gently, and praise for a whole hour when it is loosened, and if it relaxes, strain again; and if it seems to loosen, because of corrosion or because of inflammation that comes from the bone, or pain or swelling, if you are in a hurry, loosen it, and scrape the dressing, and treat what caused the wound; then reinforce the dressing, and strain until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the bones.
Bones that break in the chest do not come forth except after a great swelling behind the back, and at the head downwards; and they do not yield forth except for that which makes them slippery; and one feels them well at the inquiry as two.
And the restoration is that you put the fracture in its place, as it should be. And then put on the dressing and bind it with a bandage, if you have need of it
And if the fracture of the bones is downward towards the belly, if it causes great pain, and swelling, like blood, for the bone points the belly; and there is vomiting, and all together there is great loss of blood, which is a grievous matter, and many have died from it.
And if it is said that it is necessary to administer foods that swell the belly, to push back the wind.
We do not do this, for after eating hot food, which is harmful, does not go away. If it comes, let it be so.
And they say that one should not put compresses on the body to dry it, for this is like reason; however, there is doubt that the compress will not draw out the moisture from the body due to its weakness.
And they say that of nowhere must cover the limb with greasy wool, and put on tenses between the ribs in order to measure equally the hour round, then either cure with the treatment of pleurisin, meat and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot bear from the bone that points to the rib, and there is doubt to the patient, if you must cut above the broken rib, and you must put in instruments to hold the flesh; then you must break the bone gently, and drain slightly, and then suture the two layers of the wound, if it is large, and cure with sponges, until it is healed. And if an abscess comes, if you put on greasy cloths soaked in rose oil, and put on the limb; and cure while the limb remains above the abscess, and do not stay on the rib or it must, until it is healed.
of the fracture of the collarbone.
Never comes a sudden break of bones in the neck, or that it rains; and the same with the spine. And when this happens to no avail, and you know not whether it will be healed or not, if you take heed when you see its hands limp and fleeing and dying, and cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, if you do not feel it. Such is death in many positions, and if you move them and feel well when you strain and point, such is that the joint of the bone is saved, and that the patient will be healed, if we put in cure.</start_of_turn>
And when such things happen to the spine, and you know not whether it will be healed or not, if you take heed when you see its pieces are softened, and when an accident happens that is in the hands or on the back, with a violent wind and vomiting without volition; and when it is bound on its belly, vomiting without volition. And when it is bound on its back and it sees blood flowing, if it cannot move. Such is death: if it does not work diligently in its cure.</start_of_turn>
And if such an accident does not occur, it is the lighter thing.
And if such an accident does not occur, it is the lighter thing. If there is swelling at the apex, put on rose oil or oil of nutmeg on the spine; until it is calmed. Then put on one of the comforting and drying patches, and bind it with a thread, and command the patient to rest; and do not sleep on that part where there is pain, until it is healed.</start_of_turn> And if any bone is fractured, it is necessary to cover over the wound with a bandage; and then to unite the two ends of the wound, if it is large, with a splint, and cure it with ointment that is healing, until it is healed; and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "fracture of the heel", if it is in your left hand, put it equal to the right hand in your pocket, and put the bandage and the splint on, if you need them; then strain it, and if there are bones that are loosened, keep it still, and unite them, and cure the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Of the fracture of the thigh bone.
When the thigh bone is fractured, and if there is no sign of improvement even after a long time, and the limb is drooping downwards, and there is pain at the root, and swelling around that which breaks
And the restoration is that you extend your hand above the fracture, until you reach the fracture; and keep the limb in such a way that the fracture is properly aligned; and if the fracture is only at the shoulder, put it in its natural position, until it is perfectly healed
And if the fracture is long or is drooping downwards, make the patient sit up on his belly, until the restoration of the fracture is visible. When you have placed the limb even, if you place upon the socket a peg of wood or bone, and hold the flesh still, if it does not move; then use the hand of the patient to support the cost, as long as the limb is even.
And instruct the patient to rest on his side, or on his back
If swelling comes, if it does not touch, until the swelling has subsided, and place what we have said before; and then return to the restoration, and hold it as it should be, if there is no other mishap; and this is the method.
De la brisure de l’ajutoire.
From the dislocation of the shoulder
And thus take two fingers of the hand and grasp the limb above the socket; then hold the patient above a seat; then gently bend the arm over the fist, as far as it can go without causing pain; and put under the fist a cushion or something similar; then put the thumbs of both hands together, so that the dislocation returns as it should.
And the other method is that you support the patient on his heel, and bind the arm to his collar, and command two assistants to hold what is above the dislocation with their hands, and the other to hold below all the bones, and stretch the skin to the part.
If the extraction is too violent, strain the limb.i. the bones that are close to the elbow and on the elbow itself. Extend the thumbs of the attendants to their sides. If the elbow is close to the shoulder, put in li. the middle bone from the shoulder and the other towards the elbow. If the elbow is towards the wrist, put in li. the lighter bone, with effort, as long as the elbow is level on both sides. Then put the bone back in its place if possible, and strain, if necessary, for the wound does not come out.
If the wound comes out again, do not strain for more than three days. Put on a thick bandage of linen and oil of roses until the wound is quiet; then strain, and the way to strain is to put in the dressing under the elbow, then reassemble the arm on the splint, and put your hand on the shoulder or the chest; put on the bandage and strain on the splint and the arm, so that the arm is in its place, without anything hindering it, or without breaking the bones.
If you doubt that the bone is not moving, use splints, and put under the bone a splint that is wider and stronger than the others, and have between the splints a space of two finger-widths, so that one splint passes over the elbow two finger-widths beyond the other; then strain on the splints, as I have said at the beginning of this chapter, more strongly and less loosely
If you see the shoulder blade slipping and the limb is drawn out of its place, as we have said, while restoring the limb, if you doubt the completeness of the cautery, let it adhere until the seventh day, as we have said; then watch for seven days to see if swelling or pain does not arise in the limb, or if the limb does not regain its natural movement. If the pain persists, as we have said.
If no such thing happens, if more than two days have passed, and the patient is lying on his back with his hands on his stomach; put the limb in a cushion made of even wool, and watch for an hour or two to see if the limb is still crooked or if the ligaments are slack. If the pain persists, as we have said.
And if the fracture of the arm has happened, you must first of all set the limb in its place, and keep it still in this way for as long as necessary; and you must take care that the limb does not move too much, for this would cause more damage.  And you must feed the patient well during this time, and give him medicine for the pain.
The arm consists of three bones, which are called the "humerus" and the "ulna." One is small and is like a nail that supports the pouch; and the other is large and is like a socket, towards the little finger. By chance the large humerus alone breaks, or the small, and by chance both together break.
When the small humerus breaks, the restoration is easy, and the healing; but when the large breaks, if the healing is bad, it is more painful than when they break together. If only the small humerus breaks, if the limb is slightly extended, and made even
And if it is the large humerus that breaks, if the limb is strained more strongly; and it is stretched over the thumb, and holds the pouch of the hand higher than the other, and the small should be lower than the other two, and either the patient should be crossed over on itself, or the thumb should be in front of it higher, than the patient suffers no pain; then extend the limb slowly from the shoulder to the wrist, or to the elbow, and another assistant to the other side. And then set the limb in its natural position, according to its best form.
If it breaks into pieces, if you put some [material] into its place, and if there is none that prick [it] now, you will not be able to restore it to its place, even if you leave it there and the bone as we have said before.
If it breaks into pieces, as I have mentioned in the previous chapter; take the treatment.</start_of_turn>
If at the commencement of the restoration blood comes out through the incisions, if you glue [it] with a bandage of cerote made from rose oil and white wax, which should not be too thick or too thin; and tie [it] with a bandage above the wound so that the blood vessels are not irritated. Then put the bone back in place and put the bandage back in its place. Pour on puts the plaster, with a great deal of egg-white, because one must put the pins in; put in the pins that are more numerous at the fracture and a little wider than the others; and that the wound must have enough pins to hold it in place. The pins should be of flaxseed, neither too thick nor too thin, as I have said. And leave the bandage moist and soft, not too hard or too brittle; and the thread that is used to tie it should be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as I have said. Reward the limb and the surrounding area after a few days.</start_of_turn> If new troubles arise in the limb, as for example itching that arises in the limb, you must raise the limb with warm water, until the itching subsides; and then let the limb rest still. And then repeat the stretching, and if the tendons are softened and the bones loosen, and similar things, if necessary.
If you take care that the swelling does not come back to the limb, because it is too tight, you must soften it somewhat, and leave it alone for some days, until the swelling goes down, and then strain it.</start_of_turn>
And if none of these things that we have said help the patient, if not loosening them for twenty days or even longer, then you must hold the patient’s hands to his chest, and keep his chest even, and prevent him from moving or eating, and let him sleep on his back; and give him nourishment every thirty days or so, according to the compositions and constitutions of the virtues.</start_of_turn>
From the break of the wrist
From the break of the wrist, there are often breaks at the base of the thumb and index finger. It happens often that there is only blood flow left in many cases.</start_of_turn>
And when the bone of the wrist is broken or bruised, if it is suspected that the patient has suffered a fracture, one must hold the hand steady and keep it straight in front of them; then place the hand on the extended cloth and extend the broken bones, and put them in their proper place; and put on the dressing and bandage, if there is no swelling, and put on a splint according to the degree of displacement; and be covered with a bandage.</start_of_turn
And if the break is at the edge of the limb towards the belly of the bone, make a loop of bandage and command the patient to stretch it over their broken limb; then tighten with a long bandage, and put on a splint as large as the limb, and tighten it as much as it is convenient.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is on the side, then you must put a splint on the top and another on the bottom, so that the hand is fully extended; then bind it tightly around the hand and pack the linen between the two.
If the fracture does not arise from either side, if it is on the pouch, if it is equal, as it should be; and strain it with the splint, and if you see that it does not move, put a right-angle splint below to raise the fracture, and do not move it; or if the fracture is elsewhere, as on the index finger or any other, if it is equal, and bind it with two strong threads that follow; or bind them together tightly, as much as you can, or put on a splint, as with a pouch; and take care in restoring and positioning the burnt area, and secure what comes from it, as I have said.
of the broken limb.
The bones of the thigh are often fractured, and one can see it when it turns forward and backward; and the restoration is when it is bound with a thread above the fracture and another below. And the patient lies on his face, then extends his limbs equally; and it is when the fracture is in the marrow of the bone
And if the fracture is close to the head of the thigh, if either the upper ligament towards the heel or the lower ligament of the fracture is stretched; and in the same way if it is close to the knee, and then either the lower ligament of the knee or the upper extension; then put the thumb of the hand over the bone equal to its natural position, and then put the bandage, and bind it, if there is no displacement.
And if there is a boil above, if you leave it calm and return to your work and your treatment; the dressing is made in a rough manner. It is necessary that you wrap around the swelling, that is, a bandage twice or thrice, and in this way keep the excess blood in check, then twist the limb until the nails reach the root of the nail; and hold there for a while a thread about a league long between the hip and the limb, leaving the groin bare, and bring the thread to the top of the limb; then twist on the limb and on the hip the bandage, and put on the outer bandage, and put a pin on the bone of the limb; then use the eighth between the limb and the hip of coarse cloth to make equal the tension, and start to tie two or three knots on the bandage; and the more you go up the swelling, and the less you strain; then when you have put in two or three threads that you have left between the limb and the hip, and have put in two pins that are below, then withdraw the thread from the top of the limb, as long as you see that it comes out from below; and the strain, if it does not move from its place, then leave it be, and do not come to any other swelling or bruise or anything similar.
And if there is swelling, if it bursts, and addresses what has come, as we have said many times; and if there are pieces of bone that prick, it is necessary to remove them; and if we are unable to do so, it is necessary to cut the limb open, and drain; and cure as we have said, as long as it is healthy.
And never is the limb broken in this case when it is set, as in the shoulder and arm; however, in the restoration made thereupon, do not be afraid to make the patient suffer.
And if the limb is set in the space of one or two days, or less or more, according to the variety of temperaments.
of the street of genoil
There are often breaks in the street of genoil, but it rains many times. And if it breaks, it is not more than a tear, or a hole, and there is pain, and this is well known.
And if restoration is to be made, put the round end back into its place, until it is firmly assembled; then place the plug and insert a round pin, if you have need of it, and strain it as it should be strained; then restore all the other arrangements that we have mentioned before, such as cautery and the like; if you put into practice each of the precautions that we have mentioned, as long as it is necessary.

As for the breaking of the limb which has two bones, one of them is called the "muscle" and the other the "fossa"; and there is every chance of breaking it as it comes to the arm, and for this reason the restoration is made in exactly the same way as for the arm, and the work is exactly the same.
And if two bones are fractured together, the limb is twisted in every part.
And if a bone is fractured in two, the limb is twisted forward
And if a great bone is fractured, if one feels great pain and sees it well fractured; and the limb is twisted. Therefore bring extension, and set it even, and bind the limbs evenly; but nevertheless, if the fracture is severe, and there are many pieces, that the extension is less and lighter; and adjust accordingly to your skill.
And when you have finished your work, if you take .ij. strips of coarse wool that cover the limb from one side to the other, and be as long as the limb from the knee to the foot; then wrap in .ij. layer of lint from under and over, and bind firmly in the middle; and with this binding the limb will not slip forward or backward, and that is good; and no one should administer any other bandage that is as long as the limb, and if there is swelling, and put the limb in position to prevent movement, and do this at the fracture or wound; and move each joint of the limb to see if there is any displacement or other accident; if there is, cure it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of bones that is inside.
At the ankle there is no fracture, but in bones that are inside there is no fracture ever and two must be left, and there is only certainty in many situations.
And if there is a fracture in these bones, and you see these bones pressing against each other, if you put so much pain on the limb that it would be as if it were flying towards you, and then put your limb on the ground, where the bones are lifted up, then press the limb until it returns to its place; then put the dressing and bandage on, and put a little bandage under the belly of the limb, and bind the limb steadily, and cover it with a cloth or other things as you deem necessary.
And when two or three days have passed, if you loosen the limb, because you will find the bones equal, whether they are fractured or dislocated.
If there are two breaks, if you restore them as we have said, do two things with the hand. Then put at the break end a splint of the length of two fingers, and make it wider; then put on the thumb that I have mentioned, and strain it immediately. If there are three or more breaks, break each one and put on at each break an splint according to its quantity, enveloped in a layer of linen, and strain the thumb from the break. Keep the thumb resting on the chief of the thumb over the belly of the thumb as long as it holds it well.
Remember also the other things I have said concerning other breaks; and secure each accident as it should be secured.</start_of_turn>
of the fracture of the clavicle bone</start_of_turn>
When the bone of a woman is broken, if she sits enlarged, then lean her forward; and hold her by the back; then fill the belly with cotton, and put as much on it as on a stone; then pull out the woman, and keep her back and front; and then jump the cotton, until it reaches the entrance of the belly, and bring back the bone with the stone; and when she vomits, if the stone is in the cotton, and when she has vomited, she will recover; and such is the case for thirty days or more: if the fracture is restored, and you see it, take a bladder of elderberry, and tie a string to the navel, and pour all the bladder into the belly; then blow up the string as much as the bladder is emptied: the belly will return the fracture; then fill it with cotton, and leave it so for a few days, until it is healed.
When the bone of the shoulder of a man or a woman is broken, if it is restored as we have said concerning the bone of the thigh; and these fractures which are not obvious are seen only by him who has studied them and used them, and who has read my book. For the fracture signifies in many cases the right way of restoration: otherwise.
In the groin, when it is broken, take a gooseberry and put it in the groin; then wrap it around with a bandage, and leave it for two or three days, and it will be healed quickly.
From a break with wound.
It is necessary for one who has suffered a fracture with wound, even if it is great, if like the bone of the thigh or shoulder or similar, that he be sound now, if as we have said the wounds testify to it.
And if the wound is healed, if the vitriol remain, if you have nothing else, then resume the restoration of the fracture in this way, or that, if the pus comes out.
And if pus comes out, if you leave the restoration until tomorrow, while the pus is calmed, and do not touch neither a third nor a quarter, for you will risk coming to a bad accident.
And if the bone breaks open is appears above the joint discovered, then you must know that you must hold it firmly in your hands, slightly extended.
And if the extension does not appear to you to hold it equally in your hands, if the handle of this instrument which is of iron, which is three or four fingers long, and the width is according to the quantity of the wound; for this reason it must be grasped that it grasps three or four fingers, according to what is necessary in the bruise of the wound; and let it be round and have a large head, so that it does not press against the compression on the limb at your work, and be firm before, and large from the middle forward.
It is called a "palainche" because it must be known that when the limb is crooked the bone must be placed above the apparent head of the bone; and once it has been placed, it must be even so that one side encounters the other. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot well take hold of the bone, if you must cope with the head of the bone, as long as the instrument has possession of it.
If you cannot restore the bone as we have said, if you have grasped with a curable instrument, such as an incision or hook, at your will; then remove that which remains embedded in the bone, leaving only the rough fragments and small pieces of marrow.
When the bone is restored, and the patient experiences great pain afterwards, it is because it is not in its natural position. If you do nothing, it will swell. I.e. cover it with black vinegar and keep it covered; do not put any cerote or other material on the wound as this will cause putrefaction and corruption. Then administer medications as soon as the bone is restored, and leave the wound uncovered, covering only the surrounding area according to the size of the wound. Be careful not to strain the wound with breaking. Many times this has been the cause of death among fools, who have caused death or damage to many patients.
If the wound is small or large, and you doubt that there is any serious underlying cause, as we have said, and you experience pain, if it is not necessary to administer medications; but cover loosely around the wound with a thick cloth, and bind. And when you see afterwards, i.e. after an hour or two, that the swelling has increased at the wound, if the bone that you placed over the wound has become soft, and there is blood coming from the wound, put on healing ointment for wounds, such as tetracycline and the like.
And it must be that you draw the limb three times a day, in the morning and in the evening, until it is soldered and healed.
And it must be that the limb be put back in place gently as if it had never been dislocated
And if it recurs, and cannot be soldered but returns to its place, with slight pieces of bone, for it must be that you wish to treat the wound with care, and remove all these detached pieces that cause this pain
And if there is a fistula or other corruption of the limb, if it must be cured, according to what is said in the previous chapter. And when the bone is broken, and opened on the limb, as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder, and other similar bones of the great limbs, if it is not treated, for often death comes from this; but leave it until it has bled for about twenty or thirty days, and then cure the wound if you wish; or leave it alone.
Hair that comes out from the beard.
Hair that comes out from the beard comes out often after the heat of the bath, even when it is close to the joint, and it is a helpful sign to see the figure of the limb; and by chance it cannot make the limb move naturally.</start_of_turn>
Take care therefore that it should not slip: if you administer astringent medicines, such as aloes, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocoll, acacia, and similar things, make sure that you do not take any of these things, or all together, and mix them with a stiff wine or with much egg or with vinegar; and put them on the wound in bandage, and strain it well, and do not move it from hand to hand until it is healed; and then dislocate it, and do it again, until the nodulation is bony; or you strain on a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it can harden all the swellings under the limbs; and if the nodulation has already hardened like stone, it is necessary to break it, if the swelling under the limb is great, and make the excess visible; or do not remove it until it is bony, and cure it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
When the fracture is restored, and the limb is weak and limp, if there is any fault: because it was too tightly bound and could not be loosened; or because there is too much binding, and it cannot move smoothly; or because of numerous ligatures; or because of too great a movement, not in its entirety; or because there is much blood in the limb, if it is weak.
And the cure is that you make the patient move about, and tighten the limb, until the swelling is diminished in him; and give him baths, and make him comfortable and cheerful; then put on a bandage over the limb, so that the bandage will draw out the great swelling, and the blood flows steadily, until the limb is restored to its natural position; and bring back to its usual shape.
After the disease, the limb is twisted.
When the limb is twisted after restoration, and the bone is fractured open, and the limb is deformed, although it has returned to its natural position: if one does not believe the fools who say that the limb must be fractured anew, and many have had this done in our land; this work is blamed, and there follows great evils, and by chance death; although if the swelling and torture are fresh, if one believes they have arisen from warm water, or soft herbs are cooked, like ivy leaves, root, and melilot, and similar things; and it makes one apply a soft dressing, like good aquaintance, and take the nourishment of ivy, and confirm with butter of geline or oil of sesame, and apply the dressing on; or one takes fat figs, and grinds them with horse dung, and similar medicines that appease the swelling.
And never is the bone fractured by continuous rubbing with moist hands. And let there be provided movement for the limb during the night.
And if the dislocation is swollen and hardened, like a stone, and requires iron, it is necessary to cover the wound with a bandage, making an incision slightly deeper; and to put padding and a support in the cure.
And thus begins the book of dislocations.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, which prevents it from moving, and the limb is misaligned, causing the patient great pain and injury
When dislocation comes to no avail, if you must now restore its place.
For if it is late, if the limb is swollen, and by chance when it is reset there are points on the limb; for this reason one must not move it while it is swollen: many times this has brought on vomiting and other pains.
Whenever this happens, if you make the patient more comfortable, then let him rest, until the swelling subsides; then raise the limb high and with oil, and gently massage it, and cure each limb as it comes into its place.
I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the shoulder to the foot
Des mandibules.
The teeth are loosened and the jaws are dislocated in two ways: when they are united by the root of the teeth; or when they are entirely loosened and hang towards the chin, and cause the saliva to flow from the mouth that it cannot hold it, cannot close its mouth, and engulfs its tongue with speech.
When the dislocation is small, if it returns by itself several times
and if it is entire and accompanied, it is necessary that you immediately reset it, and do not delay;
And in such manner that the minister grasps the head of the patient and beholds one of his hands at the root of the dislocation of the mandible within the mouth, if the dislocation is of three parts; and the other hand must be thrust out, to make them even; and command the patient to soften his mandibles and move them from all sides.
And behold the mark be equal, until it returns to its place
And if it returns crooked, even though the two mandibles are together, if they arose from hot oil, as long as they remain lightly; do not attempt to force it back, as we have said
And when they are returned equally, and the patient’s mouth is closed with a gentle touch, if you put on moist cloths in a circle made of rose oil and wax, then bind them loosely with linen.
And the patient lies on his back, and his arms are placed between two cushions, so that they do not move forward or backward, do not attempt to pull them out, but gently seize the meat, until the pain is eased, and keep the jaws closed;
Then eat slowly and gently, and do not work too hard to open your mouth to eat or drink, until the jaw is well closed and healed.
And if the two mandibles do not manage to be put back in their place at a single hour, and are not firmly converted to their roots, if in comes fever and customary nausea, and by chance vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, know that it is a loss; and many times death is the consequence, in eight days.</start_of_turn>

The snare does not know how to unhook from its cost, and is devalued once it is released, and one can feel it.</start_of_turn
Et li restauration si est que li malaides gise sovin sor son dos, et estende ses bras; et puis presse le leu forment a ta palme, et elle revenra; puis met sus l’emplaustre et lou bendeil, et l’estraint.
And if the patient lies supine on his back and extends his arms; then press the limb towards your palm, and it will return; then put on the dressing and bandage, and restrain it;
And thus the dislocation is returned, when it is dislocated from its place.
From the dislocation of the shoulder.
The shoulder is dislocated only by two means: firstly, when it slips from the socket downwards; and secondly, when it slips from the head downwards; and sometimes from the upper part, and this is bad.
It does not slip behind the shoulder, nor does it slip from the nerves; and it often slips downwards towards the socket, just as is the case with those who have too little flesh; for those who have enough flesh, it slips with pain and returns with pain.
And sometimes there happens to be a fracture or dislocation, and if the shoulder is bruised with a hard blow, it is dislocated by that.
It is obvious. You must be certain that the dislocation has been completely remedied; only then should you begin the treatment.
Dislocation is known when it is tilted towards the rump, and it distinguishes between the affected shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find between their divergence an obvious difference.</start_of_turn> and at the head of the shoulder there is a socket, and the ball of the shoulder touches the head of the shoulder, as if it were a bow; and the patient is unable to move his arm to its place, or to move in any way.</start_of_turn
and also, if it is displaced upwards, if it is not hidden, because you can see it clearly;
And this method of dislocation is not without force to restore it when it is new, or when the limb is diseased.
And the way is that the physician holds the painful limb high up, then puts his thumbs under the armpit, and holds the joint forcefully high up; and the physician holds the limb and stretches it high up, because of this it comes out immediately.</start_of_turn>
And if it does not come out as we have said before, if it is to be known that the patient should be bathed in warm water; and the physician must give nourishment soothing and comforting, as for example decoction of alum and fennel and honeycomb in water, and must be given;
Then either rest the patient on his back, and put under the armpit a cushion of linen equal, not too soft nor too hard, then put the hand of the limb on the cushion, and hold the shoulder joint firmly, and treat the painful limb.
And another minister holds the patient's head firmly in place, so that it does not move downwards; when the dislocation has returned immediately, and if you see that it remains fixed in this manner,
and if it is that you make it known, that is to say, that which is greater than the patient; and be firm on the side of the cost, and hold the shoulder away from the patient's buttock, and keep the buttock high, so that the patient hangs down from the armpit. and another minister grasps the patient's arm downwards towards the abdomen. And if the patient is too light, if you put anything heavy with him, the dislocation will return immediately.
And in another way, we must hold the arm firmly: like a nail long in the earth, from which the bone is as round as a ball, neither too thick nor too thin. Then put some soft dressing on the patient, but that it should have a soft drape over, and that the patient should sit at a long distance; then extend the hand forward from the other side, and the joint will return to its place without pain
and if it does not return by all these things that we have said, if you do this cure: take one thumb and two fingers of good size, which has the head round to enter into the socket, according to this form:
Then lie upon the head of the shoulder, draped with a cloth that will not irritate the patient, then put his hands on the patient's buttocks; extend your arms over the patient's long arm, and hold the shoulder at the arm's root, and put your arm on the wrist of the hand, and put the hand on the first space of an elbow of a large size, and extend the lower hands, or leave the forearm hanging down on the other side: the shoulder is now in its place.
And when it is in its place, in whatever way, if you put his buttocks on a sphere of wool equal in size, then put the shoulder pad firmly with a powder of wheat, with incense and balm of egg, on the entire shoulder and around, then strain from the buttocks immediately, and turn the limb over the shoulder, and embrace the hand at its collar, and keep the hands immobile.</start_of_turn>
And it is necessary that he keep moving, as long as the limb is comfortable, because it will heal better; and then move more after five or six days, and move it; and if it is firm and is not softened, if it is healed.</start_of_turn
If the dislocation is forced from its place by moisture, or for some other reason, if you must administer cauteries to the two pierced parts, if it is placed before or alongside the cauteries.
If you do all this, and it lasts for seventeen days, and the dislocation does not hold, and cannot raise the upper arm, then know that the nerves of the shoulder are compressed or stretched or softened; and that the dislocation will never heal in its place.</start_of_turn>
The dislocation that is towards the elbow, and the arms, or behind, if it is done by impulse, and extension of the hands, and another support is administered; and it is cured as long as it is sound.</start_of_turn
And if after healing the limb grieves and becomes stiff, if the patient uses the limb many times, even though the pain is relieved, it returns to its original state.

And it must be known that if it is possible to restore it again as before, when the limb is relaxed, grasp the hand with your two hands and spread the arms apart, and bend the fingers according to the pain of the joint, forward and backward, and hold the joint together with your thumbs and index fingers until it returns to its place.</start_of_turn>
And if the dislocation is in front, if it returns when you double your hand over your hand, and press from the root of the bone that is loosened.</start_of_turn
And if it does not return to its place, administer strong extension; and if two ministers extend the arm and hold it by two ministers, if it does not move during extension, then turn the arm from the shoulder downwards; then cover it with a long and wide bandage.
When you see the limb at the joint, if it lacks any oil to soften the joint, then support the limb firmly until it recovers; then it returns naturally
When it is in its place, if you put on dry compresses with an egg yolk, and the limb becomes strained, and you bend the arm at the shoulder of the patient, and leave it for some days, then take it off.
If the joint is firmly fixed in its place, if you detach the limb and leave it; if you see that the joint does not hold firmly, recommence the displacement and reattach the limb, and leave it thus for some days, until it is firmly set; then detach it.
If there is pain after the joint is repositioned, and it moves, bathe and rub the area thoroughly, and press until the pain is gone; or put a poultice of fat mutton grease on the joint, then leave it for a day and a night, then remove the poultice and let the limb move naturally When it sweats, wipe the joint gently, then put the poultice back on, and then enter or bathe; and do this two or three times, until it is healed; and if you see that it is better, put on warm salves soaked in butter, and strain on it; if it returns to its natural position.
The dislocation of the hand
The dislocation of the hand has loosened, and the return is slight, more so than in other joints, so it must be forcibly returned to its place immediately, while it is still loose, and even if there is swelling or if there is a wound.
And thus you must hold the painful limb over a table, and extend the limb, and look that it is even, until it has reached its place.
However, you must ensure that it is properly aligned; then place the painful hand back on the table with its palm facing upwards, and hold it in place. If the dislocation is at the back of the hand, make the patient rest their hand face down on the table, and their gaze rest their hand on the appearance of the joint. If it returns, that is well.
If this does not occur, if the strain of soothing supports postoperatively remains, and you leave it in its place, let it resume its natural position.</start_of_turn>
And if it cannot bear it, and you do not wish to set it after a certain number of days, the joint will become immobile.</start_of_turn
neither must he be forced to do anything except to keep the hand still, and must not be strained in any way; for if the nerves are severed or the veins are cut, nothing else is of any use.</start_of_turn>
And when the hand is at rest, if you place upon the place mentioned above, then strain and leave for five days, then loosen and leave thus.
If it does not move well, and if there is no pain, if there is warm fluid, and you rub it until it is healed
of the dislocation of the arm bones.
Never are the arm bones dislocated forward or backward or to the front or the back.
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated, and it returns to its place, support the shoulder firmly, and then slowly move the limb back to its original position.
When it has remained for three days, and then it is made even; and do not bind it, as we have said, and do not move it, and bind it again; do this often, until it is tight.
And do the same in the case where the arm is dislocated from the shoulder, and do as you have done before, until it is healed; and do the same in the case where it is dislocated from another part.
Because of the loosening of the scapula from the back.
When the scapula of the shoulder or the collarbone is loosened, or if there are several dislocations, and there is no remedy, for the patient's life is hurried.</start_of_turn>
And the sign is that the spurting of blood seems to flow in the opposite direction, and it cannot be held, and many times it makes the limb limp or the knees or arms or the toes limp.</start_of_turn
And many times the scapula moves three parts; the one that moves at the back is called "gilbosite".
The cure is that if the swelling comes from infancy, and there is no remedy or cure for it.
And that which comes from a wound or percussion or similar things, they say the old doctors used great words for the cure, but there is no great benefit from them.</start_of_turn>
but I have abridged it according to my intention, and I have formed instruments in various ways.</start_of_turn>
I say that in the swelling that comes before, there is no remedy or salvation;
And thus too, when it comes directly in these costs, and it cannot be cured except by that which comes from behind, as I have said.
And thus too, when it comes directly in these costs, and it cannot be cured except by that which comes from behind, as I have said. For the patient must keep his face entirely straight, and must endure the pain without blinking.
Then take the thumb of the hand and hold the head of the shoulder firmly in the earth, and take another and place it below the patient’s armpits, and bind another around the waist of the patient, and another around the thighs, and another around the calves, and another around the ankles.
And two assistants should know the ropes, one at the head and the other at the feet, among the three thumbs;
And let the eyelids be well closed, as we have said, and look intently with your palms placed upon the spine, until it returns.
If it does not return by this remedy, take two fingers of length, and press the base of the thumb downwards, and the patient should be on the side, and support the head of the thumb downwards, then put the middle of the thumb upon the spine; and put the palms of your eyes upon the other head of the thumb, and press firmly, until it returns to its place; and if you see that it is turning at the wrist, do it at the nut that turns at the hand.
And take four thumbs at the chief of the patient’s arm of a great hand, and over the other two, and have between each thumb a sleeve and a bandage, a palm of spice of length;
And in each basin there is one opening, or the net turns round, and the basins are firmly fixed in the earth, so that they do not move; and between each two basins there are one turning, so that the line turning returns, and there are in two turnings two small basins of a palm's length, in order to return the net.
Then the line which is between the buttocks towards the head of the net, and the other line towards the pieces towards the other net, and between these basins the minister turns his net all around the line, and the master puts the thorn even as we have said.</start_of_turn>
And when it is even, put upon dry desiccant with abundance of eggs, and then press, and then hold in place with a tablet of two fingers long, that prevents the swelling of the marrow and the sensitive part of the spine, and then bind with a line, as we have said, and use the patient’s natural nourishment secretly until he is healed.</start_of_turn
And if nothing else comes to pass at the end of treatment, if it is necessary, administer soothing and calming medicines, as we have said above; and never give a dose of lead.
And never let there appear at the back of the spine a swelling, for that is a dislocation; and it is the bone that breaks, for in no way must we presume: by chance death will come.
hip dislocation
The hip joint and shoulder joint never dislocate except for dislocations alone, never if like other joints; and the joint of the thigh is damaged in three parts: front and back, and front and back; the more inward it is, the more it is damaged in front and back.
And if it is known that the dislocation has occurred within the limb, when one joins the diseased limb with the tendon, if it is longer and the diseased knee is greater than the sound knee, and the diseased limb cannot bend as much as the sound limb at the knee; And thus is the cause of this displacement from the apophysis of the bone, for in this case the head of the humerus comes out of its place.
And the sign of this displacement is that these accidents are contrary to those mentioned above.
And the sign of this displacement is that if the limb is well placed according to the completion, although it is not doubled at the knee with pain, if one sees that it is done too violently, it cannot be done immediately and is delayed, it retains the urine, swells the belly, and when it walks, it passes over the heel.
And the sign of that which has behind, if it cannot expand its knee, cannot double, and is that limb shorter than the other, and the ankle is softened, and the head of the thigh is displaced from its socket.
If this semblance of dislocation recurs, if it is an old dislocation and does not move according to its setting, if there is no remedy; then I advise you to have suspicion.</start_of_turn>
And in this case where the dislocation is fresh, and there are three ways of dislocation, if you hurry that you return the joint, and stretch it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; by chance if it returns, and there is no need for any other remedy.</start_of_turn
And if it does not return in this manner, if you must, appear with great force, and grasp the limb firmly with two hands, or with one hand as you deem fit on the joint itself. And another minister should extend his hand downwards somewhat as though grasping his heels with his toes, then grasp it with a strong thread on the hip; and another holds the head of the limb.</start_of_turn>
And extend upwards and downwards together until the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remain suspended.</start_of_turn>
This method of extension is common in three out of four cases. If the dislocation has returned, as we have said, that is good.
If this is not the case, it is necessary to take care of the semblance. When the dislocation is recurrent, it is necessary to place the limb above the costal cartilage, then place the limb over the root of the scapula, and the limb which is below the angle, and stretch the limb upwards towards the angle, and downwards towards the forcele.
Then take another assistant and embrace the large limb of the painful shoulder, and stretch it out towards the front: if it returns to its place now; and this method of dislocation is less laborious than the others.
And if you do not manage to secure it in this manner as we have said, if you must, bind the two feet of the patient together with a strong thread over the two toes and over the two knees, and let the limb be extended two inches more than the others.
Then let it hang from the head of a staff, or on the ground two arms’ length; and command the minister to grasp the head of the shoulder, and let another minister be suspended with the patient, who graspes the shoulder, for the joint has now returned soundly.</start_of_turn>
And when the dislocation is driven out, if the patient lies down as we have said in the one with swelling, and grasp .i. thread on the limb properly, and on the heel also.</start_of_turn
Then put the thumbs, one at the shoulder and the other at the elbow, and then grasp one thumb between the thighs of the patient, squeezing it lightly. Then spread out moist towels around the patient, so that he does not bleed, and extend your thumbs ministering to him, and look with your eyes that his hand is in its proper place regarding the dislocation.</start_of_turn>
If it returns, that is good. But if not, put on a board there and press on it as we have said in the spasm, and let the patient rest on the solid side.</start_of_turn>
And when the dislocation is forward, if you must extend the limb gently, as I have said; and put your eyes on the pain of the shoulder of the patient, and press on the other hand, and extend it towards the groin.</start_of_turn
And if the dislocation is urgent, if it is not possible to extend the patient, do not lift him up from the earth, but rather that he remain as he is, as if he had fallen from a height; as we have said previously concerning the injuries to the joints of the armpits. And either be lying on his face, and the limb is extended as we have said before, and must press on the joint at the table;
And will be at rest when the patient extends his legs, and they will be equal; then join the buttocks, and put the support, and strain with a bandage, so that the shoulder is not moved;
And if it rests for two or three days, then loosen it and place the bandage upon it; and if you see that they are even, if strained as before, leave them for two days. Then loosen it and make it bleed gently until the limb is comfortable.
And if it rests for two or three days, then loosen it and place the bandage upon it; and if you see that they are even, if strained as before, leave them for two days. Then loosen it and make it bleed gently until the limb is comfortable.
The shoulder joint is dislocated in two ways: front to back and front to back; and do not strain it forward.
And the sign is that if you command the patient to bend their limb at the knee, and they do not touch their knee, discharge the urine that is in their bladder.
and restore them all if you make the patient sit upright, and extend their limb if they can, and place your hand on their face, and put their heel on your palms.
then take their knee in your palms, and pull between your shoulders, then bend their legs together; and another minister extends their heel, as long as the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that they have properly bent their knee lightly.
and put the dressing on, and air the limb to the knee, and bind them firmly together for two or three days, then take it off; and do not let the patient move until the limb is comfortable.
If the limb is not at a point, if an extension is administered strongly, as we said in the treatment of the hernia, until it is healed.
Until it is healed.
Never is the shoulder dislocated, and never is it completely loosened, and always inward and downward.
And the sign is that the limb is fleeing, and hangs before the part where it is loosened:
When the limb is slightly moved, it should be gently stretched out with the hands when it is only slightly swollen.
When it is completely dry, if you must force the patient to sit upright, and hold his foot firmly by the ankle;
Then take hold of the limb with your right hand, and then with your left hand twice, and then stretch it upwards, and keep it well stretched out;
Do this twice as we have said, pressing and pulling the limb; if it comes back, that is good; if not, repeat the procedure, for it will come back.
If it cannot return spontaneously, if you make the patient sit on his back on the earth, and put one foot firmly on the earth between his thighs, and hold the blanket around him, so that he does not move the patient.
Then hold the patient’s thigh, and another attendant extends the limb at his hands or feet, which is placed on the collar of the limb; Then extend the thumbs of both attendants equally, and hold the dressing either between the patient’s thighs to retain the patient when it is stretched.
Then put the eyes equally on the dislocation at his hands, and another attendant grasps the limb at the shoulder, and the dislocation will return immediately.
And when it reaches a point, put on the plaster and stamp on it, and the strain forms, and tie the limb to the leg, and guard the nerves that are above the ankle behind, so that the ligature is not too tight.
Then leave it for one or two days, and if the ligature becomes loose, strain it; then unfasten it a third or a fourth time, and tell the patient to move around for three days. and if he goes forward with this, it is not certain that it will not become worse again.
If the afterbirth remains in the vagina, as we have already said, until it is sound.
If the afterbirth remains in the vagina, as we have already said, until it is sound.
When the afterbirth is discharged, if one believes it diligently, it is a light matter.
If the dislocation is not at the back of the shoulder, if one believes it diligently, one must sit the patient either on the left or right side of the bed, and put the limb on what is open of these joints, then press on the limb until it returns to its place;
And when they are even, and there is nothing open, if you put some salt on the root of a thistle and hold it against the shoulder for three days, then the strain will subside, and you should leave it for two days, and then remove it; and then rest it until it is healed.</p>
And when they are even, and there is nothing open, if you put some salt on the root of a thistle and hold it against the shoulder for three days, then the strain will subside, and you should leave it for two days, and then remove it; and then rest it until it is healed.</p
When there is both a wound and a dislocation, and it has been restored, many times it has happened that the patient has died.</p
If you are not confident in your skill in healing, and if you are not learned in the art and have not used it for a long time, and if you are not merciful and compassionate and punctual, do not attempt it;
If you do not expect to bring about salvation at the outset, hold the patient’s hand and leave him to God, for if you see no hope of health; and when you see hope, if you now reset the limb, even though the abscess persists;
and when the limb is set, if you administer calming things around the burn, and cure the wound, as it should be, with desiccated ointment.
And if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and minor bones are fractured, if the bones, do as we have said in simple ailments;
And if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and minor bones are fractured, if the bones, do as we have said in simple ailments; and take heed not to enter into fear, as I have said, for this is worth much to you according to your Creator, and for the salvation of your soul and your body. Amen.
