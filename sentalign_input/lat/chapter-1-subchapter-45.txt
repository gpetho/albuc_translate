On the method of cauterizing for hernias.
Chapter 47.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or fatty tissue descends to the testicle, and it is in the early stage, then you must instruct the patient to refrain from eating for a day.
And he should use laxatives, so that stool may pass from his abdomen.
Then let him sit on his back in your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the fatty tissue or intestine emerges or becomes visible.
Then, reduce it with your fingers, and mark under the rupture over the pubic bone with ink, using a symbol whose end resembles half a circle facing the upper body.
Then heat the cautery in the fire, in this shape, until it turns white and sparks.
Then return the intestine or fatty tissue to its cavity.
Then let the assistant place his hand over the area so the intestine does not exit: and now you spread the patient's legs, place a cushion under him, with one assistant holding his legs and another on his chest holding his hands.
Then place the cautery over the marked spot, holding your hand with the cautery upright.
And hold it there until you reach the bone with it; or repeat another time, if you have not reached the bone on the first attempt.
And carefully watch for the exit of the intestine at the time of your cauterization, lest you burn it, and cause either death or severe harm to the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your procedure will not be effective.
And the cautery for children must be fine, according to their size.
Then treat it with other ointments, until it heals.
And the patient should lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And his nourishment should be regulated during his recovery period to keep his bowels soft, so the intestine does not exit during strain or evacuation.
Then, when he wishes to get up after forty days, apply a properly made bandage, and he should wear it for another forty days.
And he should avoid labor, overeating and drinking, and loud voices.
For when he follows this regimen, he will be healed completely.
And I will describe the treatment of ruptures with incision in its own chapter.
But when ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen, and are in the early stages, and you wish to prevent their growth, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let the area burned be about a third of it.
Then treat it with what we have mentioned, and it will not grow further.
And some of the ancients have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, in this shape.
After marking it with ink, a line is drawn transversely on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
And place your hand in the middle with a key-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
