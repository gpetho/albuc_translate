of urinary retention
Urinary retention is due to blockage by a stone, or by clotted blood, or by swelling, or by dead flesh, or by similar things, which we have mentioned in the division; and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone that is stuck in the neck of the bladder, then the patient must be bent over his knees; and his feet should be placed on his back, and he should stretch his belly from above his back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is forced to expel the stone upwards, which releases the urine; and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called "syringe," which has this form: it should be of thin silver, lightly capped, like the feather of a bird; and the tube should be a palm and a half long, and thin at the end.
And the method of releasing the urine is that you take a double thread, and tie a small piece of wool or cotton to the end, and insert the end of the thread into the syringe; and cut off the excess wool and push it to the end of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and sprinkle the bladder and penis with warm oil and olive oil and lukewarm water; then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the base of the penis, then bend the penis over towards the belly; then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient will feel it reach the empty space, and this is not done according to this order except because the duct through which it goes is twisted; then pull the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine will follow the wool, then pull it out, and let the urine flow; and repeat with the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
