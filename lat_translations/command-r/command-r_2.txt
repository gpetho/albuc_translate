Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed for you, my sons, this book, which is the ultimate book of knowledge in medicine with its complement, and having reached the end of it through its expositions and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise, which is part of surgical operation, namely surgery by hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery by hand has been neglected in our region and in our time: until perhaps its knowledge is lost and its trace is cut off; and there remain only small descriptions of it in the books of the ancients, which have been changed by other hands; and they suffer error and hesitation, until their intentions are obscured and their insight is weakened: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise concerning it according to the way of expositions, declarations, and abridgments; and that I should come to the forms of cautery tools and other instruments of surgery: as this is done through adding declarations and by expediting what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good practitioner of this kind of surgery is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, as described by Galen, until he knows the limbs' benefits, their shapes, and their connections and separations; and has knowledge of bones, nerves, sinews, and their number, their exits, pulsating veins, quiet veins, and their places.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for this, Hippocrates said that names are many with names, but few with deeds; and especially so in the art of hand-surgery.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have indeed spoken about it in the introduction to this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since those who are not knowledgeable about what we have said regarding anatomy will inevitably fall into error, which leads to the death of people; as I have seen many of them, trained in this science, boast about it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened is that I saw a foolish doctor cut into a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck and he struck some arteries in her neck; therefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who presumed to extract a stone from an old man, and the stone was big.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He reached for it and extracted it with a piece of bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself had already been called to extract it; and considering the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, I saw that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who was taking a fee from one of the Dukes of our land for his medical services; and it so happened that a black eunuch who belonged to him suffered a fracture in his leg near the heel bone: and this physician hastened with his ignorance, bound up the fracture above the wound with swathes, splints tightly binding them on with a strong ligature, and he gave no breathing space to the wound.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he released him according to his own wishes.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	After a few days he let him go and ordered him not to remove the bandages; so he remained thus until an abscess had formed on his leg, foot and reached death's door.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was called to him and I hastened to release his ligaments; and there followed calmness and he escaped from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the injury was already too advanced in his limb; and I could not reverse it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, the injury ceased to progress further into his limb until it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who perforated a cancerous abscess; and it became ulcerated after days until its evil was magnified against its owner.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	This is because when a cancer is purely from melancholy humour, then it ought not to be approached with iron at all unless it is in a limb that can tolerate having the whole of it cut away.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for that reason, O sons, you need to know that operations with the hand are divided into two categories: namely, an operation associated with safety; and an operation which carries danger in many of its aspects.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have raised the point in every place throughout this book where an operation comes up which inspires terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	It is necessary for you to beware of that and avoid it so that fools do not find a way to talk about it and bring dishonour upon it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	So take the measure with care and protection; treat your patients with ease and confidence; and follow a better way leading to salvation and laudable succession by God's grace; and cast aside terrible illnesses difficult of cure; and lift from yourselves that which makes you afraid, so that hesitation does not enter into your faith or your benefit.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	It is indeed more conducive to your glory, and elevates you higher in this world, and ultimately to your greatness.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said so in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat an illness badly, lest you be called bad doctors.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have now divided this treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter one.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On cauterization with fire and sharp medicinal instruments, catalogued and arranged from head to toe, along with the forms of cauterizing tools and equipment, and everything else that is required for this operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On cutting open, boring through, bloodletting and blisters, wounds; extracting arrows and the like; catalogued and arranged along with forms of instruments used for these procedures.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, dislocations, treating twisted injuries and the like; catalogued and arranged from head to toe with forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	Albucasis's Book of Surgery.
Pars I.	Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the advantages and disadvantages of cauterization; which constitutions it suits, when to do it; whether with an iron or gold instrument.
Caput I.	Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before reminding you of the procedure with him, it is necessary to say something about the advantages and disadvantages of this treatment; which constitutions it suits.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say, therefore, that discourse on the quality of cauterization and its harm is a lengthy and subtle matter, knowledge, and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	There also spoke to him a multitude of wise men, and they disagreed about it; for my part, I have had enough from their speeches, fearing the lengthiness of them.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say, therefore, that cauterization suits universally every constitution which is with matter and without matter: except for two constitutions, which are the warm constitution without matter, and the dry constitution without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, they disagreed about the warm and dry constitutions with matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some said that cauterization is beneficial in these cases.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite, namely that cauterization is not suitable for an illness which arises from heat and dryness; because the nature of fire is hot; and it is inappropriate to treat a hot and dry illness with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And the one who said the opposite argued that cauterization is beneficial for every hot and dry illness which occurs in human bodies; because when you compare a human body and its moisture to the constitution of fire, you find the human body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And for my part, I say by his argument; because experience has already proven this to me on several occasions.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, one should not proceed with this unless he is already proven and practiced in the final exercise of cauterization, and has understood the variety of human constitutions, and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, their causes, circumstances, and duration.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From other complexions, there should be no fear upon you: especially in cold and humid illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For indeed all physicians have agreed on them: and they did not dissent from assisting with cauterization on these.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, my sons, that from the secrecy of cure by means of cauterization with fire, and its superiority over cauterization with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member which is cauterized: and it harms no other member connected with it, save with a small harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which extends from the members: and perhaps it causes to happen in the member a difficult-to-heal illness, and perhaps kills (the patient).
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it exceeds (what is necessary).
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now indeed that has become known to us through experimentation, because of the length of our service and study with this art, and our stance upon the truth of things: and I am absolved from the length (of this discourse).
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not for the fact that it is not permitted to my book to bring you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodily expulsions, by which it expels illnesses with a philosophical demonstrative discourse, which would sharpen your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, my sons, that they themselves disagree about the time when it is appropriate to perform a cautery, and suggest that spring is the better season.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that a cautery is appropriate at any time: for the accidental harm because of the time is submerged in the benefit which is drawn with the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cauterization is for pains arising from necessary, strong, urgent pains that cannot tolerate delay; for this reason because it is feared that a worse evil may occur which is greater than a small harm that goes untreated due to time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it enter your minds, O sons, that which is not held in contempt by the masses and foolish physicians, namely, that for an illness that is healed through cauterization, there is not always a relapse; and they consider this as a consequence, but the matter is not as they think: because cauterization is nothing other than a type of medicine which alters the complexion and dries up the moist humors which are the cause why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, the cautery is superior to medicine for its speed of healing, and the power of its operation, and the strength of its dominion; and it is possible that illness may return at some point in time depending on the complexion of the patient, and where the illness is located, and their own constitution; and what has accumulated in their body through the aggregation of excesses there; and what they have acquired for themselves through diet and similar causes unless the illness which requires cauterization.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Subtle illness in a limb due to few excesses and humors, such as toothache cautery, because of pain, and similar cases, it is possible that the pain may not return.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this occurs rarely.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the talk of the common people is again wrong; that cauterization is the last resort of medicine is a correct statement, not in the way they intend it; for they believe that there is no cure which can be combined with medicine or anything else after the application of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The truth is the opposite of that, and the intent is that cauterization, which is the last resort in medicine, is not so unless we have administered other treatments for a particular illness but they were ineffective; then as a final measure we administer cauterization, and it works. Thus, in this sense, cauterization can be considered the ultimate medical treatment, contrary to popular understanding among laymen and many foolish physicians.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron; they said this only due to the equality of gold and the high regard for its substance, and they claimed that a cauterized site does not produce pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	However, this is not always the case; I have proven it myself and found that cauterization with gold does not prevent pus formation in certain bodily tissues more so than other metals.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization with gold is good, and better than iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you heat the gold cautery in fire, it is difficult to determine when it reaches the desired temperature due to the melting point of gold; and if you apply too much heat, it will liquefy and turn into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	The artist falls short due to this issue; therefore, cautery with iron is quicker and more convenient for us to use in practice, which is the right approach.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	I have organized this chapter on cautery according to different sections; I have arranged them from head to toe so that the reader can easily find what they are looking for.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	On how to cauterize the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here cauterization is applicable for the control of moisture and coolness in the brain; these are two causes of frequent headaches, and profuse discharges from the head into the regions of eyes and ears, and excessive sleepiness, toothache, sore throat; and universally all diseases that occur due to cold, such as paralysis, and sodae, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ailments.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is as follows: you should instruct the patient to first evacuate their head by cleansing it with three or four nights of purgative medicine, according to the strength of the patient and his age and habits.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then have him sit between your hands in a square position so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of their nose between their eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with an unburnt cautery iron.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then fire the olive oil cautery which has this form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place the iron on the marked spot, gradually lowering your hand until it is constricted, and you turn the iron round and round.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly and examine the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that an area the size of a bean or a quantity of rue has been burnt off the bone then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat with your hand the same iron, or with another from the same if it gets cold: until the bones that I told you are visible.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the dressing in it, and place it on the site: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the dressing soaked in butter on top of it, and leave it in place until the fire blister is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with the four-herb ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They already said that the longer a wound stays open, the more it discharges pus: which is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone: and the cautery should be held in place until something thick from the bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then scrape after what has been burnt of the bone, then it should be treated.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to reach with the cautery until an imprint of the foot of a teapot is made in the bone, so that the bone falls out which becomes like the mold of a kirate: or an instrument that women put infused almond oil into: and they estimate that vapors exhale from this place, and leave the wound open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated until it consolidates.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, however, these two types of cautery do not seem suitable except for certain people according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And in my view it is better to leave it with his health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head is weakened due to the dissolution of its natural continuity; as we have witnessed with other body parts; especially when the patient's head is naturally weak; and I find the first kind of cauterization safer and better, so that is what I use; thus let us proceed with it for the sake of healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	On how to cauterize the head in cases of general headache.
Caput III.	Head three.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a prolonged chronic headache occurs all over the head; and it persists with the patient; and they have used hyeris, cochiis, caputpurgiis, oils, and emplastra.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized once with the cautery that we described and none of those things help; then consider this.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the patient's head is of a strong natural constitution and not weak, but they experience severe cold; then cauterize with another small cautery underneath it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over the entire horn of its head with a cautery, but do not let it pass through the skin and expose bone in the quantity that we described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with one cautery on the occipital bone of its head, in the place which is called vas; and this is the spot where the windpipe is placed; and raise your cautery here, but do not expose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the patient will find relief from that severe pain which is different from the pain of all other cauterizations of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this the Cautery of its place; and it must be a cautery which is thinner for cauterizing the horns of the head and the occipital bone than the one used for cauterizing the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Regarding the method of cauterization for headaches, both with burning medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and numbness occur on one side of the head, or when the pain extends to the eye, and it is evacuated with cleansing medicines for the head, and the rest of the treatment that I mentioned in the divisions of diseases does not help: then cauterization is performed on it in two ways: either cauterization with burning medicine; or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	Cauterization with burning medicine is as follows: take one brick and scrape it, then cut off its ends on both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then split the painful area at an appropriate time with a wide bloodletting instrument until there is a place beneath the skin where the brick fits.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Insert it into the space under the skin until it is hidden; then secure it over the brick with a suitably tight bandage and leave it for fifteen hours before removing it, taking out the brick, and leaving the wound to rest for two or three days afterwards. Once pus forms at the site, treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do it with some burning medicines that I wrote about in the twelfth treatise on Caustic Medicines, you may.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization with iron is as follows:
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	A hot cautery of this shape should be used.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	It is called a "clavelis", because the shape of its head resembles that of a nail, with some curvature and a small prominence at its centre.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it over the site and hold your hand; you turn the blade gradually with speed; and let what is cauterized in depth of skin be like half its length.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand so that the artery below is not cauterized, otherwise a bleeding will occur.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the dressing in salt water and place it over the site for three days; thereafter apply a dressing with butter; later dress it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this half of the skull with the second blade-like end of the Cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And excavate from the incsion of the artery on this half of the skull, not that ancient one specifically.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	§ On the method of cauterizing an ancient half of the skull.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When treating a half of the skull, with what we said in the previous treatment and what we mentioned in our classification of diseases, if the treatment does not work: and you see from the disease that it is not sufficient for what we have said about the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire, then you must use the fiery blade-cautery until it becomes white after marking over the painful site with a line whose length is half of a finger, or close to this: and lift your hand once, and press on it until you cut the artery, and arrive at the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However it is necessary for you to avoid the continuation of the jaw which moves during chewing, so that the side or nerve moving it are not burnt, otherwise a spasm will happen.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And it should be above the wound, and take care of the flow of blood from the severed artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For its severance is feared, especially by him who does not know what he is doing and is neither studious nor experienced; and he abandons the operation with it in the first place.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with the reminder of the treatment of accidental bleeding from an artery according to its own manner and in this book's place.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see that the illness is not sufficient for this cautery, and you see the patient's body bearing the cautery on the top of the head, as we described, take care of the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, apply the cautery we mentioned in the chapter on artery extraction using a cautery with two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cauterization is better and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	Regarding the method of cauterizing for ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When there is ear pain due to cold and it is treated with solutions and the remaining treatment we mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cautery by fire: and this is what is called a Point, whose form is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then make points with it after its heating around the whole ear as it turns; or around either one if there is pain simultaneously in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And move away with the cautery from the root of the ear slightly after you have marked the places with encaustic: and let there be ten points of the cautery on each ear, and almost that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On how to cauterize in tortures.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	A torture which is cured by cauterization occurs only from the types which happen because of phlegm, as we said in our classifications of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And the deviation of this cautery is due to desiccation or nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of torture with eels and enemas and gargles but it doesn't help the patient then you must cauterize him three times: once at the root of the ear, second just below the ear lobe, third where the two lips join together.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur unless it happens to the part which appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the shape of this cautery is that you burn it with a cautery on the extreme upper edge of the ear near its horn slightly, and another under the lobe; each to be as long as one's thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And remove your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burnt.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the shape of the cautery and it belongs to the knife type which has been mentioned above; however, its thickness isn't very fine as you can see, there should be a little bit more thickness than what's needed for a knife.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound with what has been mentioned above until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	The method of cauterization for old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When old apoplexy is treated, and you treat it with what we have said, but your treatment does not take effect and the patient has no fever, then cauterize them with four cauteries over each corner of their head, one on the middle of the head as we mentioned, and another at the back of the head, depending on which occurred; the method of the cautery should be according to what was previously said.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	It is also cauterized with the cautery over the stomach bone, which is more effective.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat it with what was previously said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	The method of cauterization for forgetfulness.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	The patient should be given large draughts of fresh water to drink first, and then purgative pills that clean the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then completely shave the patient's head, and apply to their neck a plaster made with mustard described in the treatise on plasters; do this several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For this is the method of cauterization; and do it in the same way as I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore it heals with that treatment, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then give them three cauteries at the back of their head that extend downwards from the top of the head to just below the eye level; and leave a digit's width between each cautery.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cauteries with what was previously said.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you wish to add an extension and the patient can tolerate it, then make a cautery mark in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish to add an extension, then cauterize it above the two corners.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat it until it is healed; let the cautery be anointed with oil according to the form that has been set forth.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	On the method of cauterizing for paralysis and softening.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary that you proceed with the cleaning of the head using leeches, and with what we have said above.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then scrape the patient's head; afterward cauterize it with a cautery mark on the middle of the head, and a cautery mark above each corner of the head, and a cautery mark at the back, and three marks over the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however you need to soften a bodily illness with many of these [cauterizations], and the patient can tolerate it, and the sickness is strong; then cauterize it with four cauteries over the vertebrae of the back, and the last one with a cautery until it burns through most of his skin, and lift your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then treat it until it is healed; and thus anoint the cautery with oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	On the method of cauterizing for epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic is not cauterized unless it is an epileptic whose epilepsy arises from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	You should therefore clean his brain first with leeches and with the other treatment that we have mentioned in this section; when the patient is large or can tolerate taking medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If it is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then a gargle and chewing cleansers for the brain are administered many days beforehand with the right choice of foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then you shave his head, then cauterize it with one cautery iron in the middle of the head, as previously described in this way: and another cautery iron on his occipital bone, and over every horn of his head a cautery iron.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If the patient is strong and able to tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cautery irons that I mentioned for someone with paralysis, and apply a softening agent to the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the iron be olive-oil heated according to the method described earlier.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	If however the patient is a child, then place a fine iron, according to this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	On the method of cautery for melancholia.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the cause of melancholia is corrupted humours, and thick phlegm, then cauterize with the irons that we described for someone with paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholia is an excess of black bile towards melancholia, and the patient's body is moist, then give him in his drink something that cleanses his brain, as described earlier in this book: then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a decently-made linen pad like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place this on the middle of the head: and let the patient be held from every side while sitting upright.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then bring forward an ointment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	It is better to use old butter from sheep's milk.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	Heat it over a gently warming fire to the measure that it can be tolerated by the finger when inserted inside.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then squeeze it out on his head in the middle, and leave it there until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this to the sick person once every week, along with the rest of his good diet, until he is cured.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small points on him, apart from the part where you are holding your hand with the cauterizer; let it be fragrant.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then put on it a poultice soaked in butter, or in hen's fat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	On the way of cauterizing downward to the eye with water.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When it is declared to you that water has come out of the eye through signs, which I mentioned above, then begin and make the sick person drink with something that will purify his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And guard him from all moisture, and make him sit in the bath, fasting for a few days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then order him to scrape his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize it over the two temples with two cauterizers, if there is a beginning of water coming out of both eyes at once; or from one side, if there is a beginning of water in one eye; and cut off all veins and arteries that are under the skin with the cauterizer; and let the cauterizers be as long as the width of the temples; and beware of blood flow.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything coming out of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the wisdom that is in extracting arteries, cutting them, and being cautious of blood flow.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under two bones, with two final cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	On the method of cauterizing in ancient tears.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old and persistent: and they are on the veins and arteries that are visible on the outside of the head, it is verified that this is due to excess cold phlegm; then cauterize with a cautery as I described at the beginning regarding descending moisture, a cautery in the middle of the head, two cauterizations over each temple, and two cauterizations on the neck below two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you need additional treatment, then cauterize it on each side of the eye carefully, at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	On the method of cauterizing nasal odor.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it with what we have said regarding division, and the treatment is not effective; then proceed quickly, and give him a drink of infirmochia three nights in a row: then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized cautery, using olive oil.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with a claw-like cautery with two cauterizations over each eyebrow under the hair slightly.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And take care to avoid the artery, so as not to cut it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	This is the form of Clauelis cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	On the method of cauterizing a softened eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of an eye is softened by disease or moisture, then it should be cauterized with a single cautery, using this crescent-shaped cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above both eyebrows with two small cauteries on each side; and let them be stretched from the two temples; and let the length of every cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not remove your hand with the cautery, but rather according to the quantity that the third eyelid is burnt.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of the cautery for this method of lunar cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the method of cauterizing an eyelid with ingrown hairs that irritate the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery for this is according to two methods: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with caustic medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	But in the case of a fire cautery, instruct the patient beforehand to remove their hairs, if they are among those who do so, until they are extended and equalized.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If however they irritate him at their root, then compress his eyes with cloth so that they do not move until they are burnt.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore they are burnt and equalized, then place the patient's head in your lap; next mark over the eyelids of his eyes with the cautery iron, a sign that is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the sign be close to the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a poultice soaked in egg white: or in psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply a cauterizer with this form.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the shape you marked out slowly with many passes until the skin surface is burned away, revealing a figure like that of a myrtle leaf entirely visible.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of your work's success is: if you see the eyelid already closing and hairs rising near the eye wound.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore raise your hand then: and leave him for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place over it a poultice with butter until the scab is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any of the hairs grow back after this time and the eyelid softens again then repeat the cauterization over that spot as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	But if the hairs are on the lower lid then cauterize it until they rise up to their proper place and level so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the method of cauterizing with burning medicine in this case:
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is as if you advise the patient to let his hairs grow until they are long enough and levelled so that they do not prick the eye.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a myrtle leaf shape out of paper.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from well-known soap and from quicklime an ounce weight of each one or something like that then grind them together finely and do so swiftly so they don't get cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then cut out a piece from it in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over one eyelid or both.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a poultice soaked in egg white; make sure the patient's head rests in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	Put your index finger on the medicine and press it down lightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	Move it around every time the patient feels a stinging sensation from the medicine, because its sting is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	So while you persist with this stinging sensation that he feels, then let go of the medicine and move it around using your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	Once the stinging sensation subsides, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	Then examine whether you see the eyelid swell up like it does when exposed to fire or a small incision; if so, that is good. If not, then apply more medicine on the area where the medicine has not been applied and has no mark until your procedure is even and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place on it a poultice with butter until the burnt skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	After that, treat it with diaphony ointment or another, until the wound heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	During your procedure you must pay special attention to the final check to ensure that none of the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after a few days and something gets stuck in the eye from hairs, then reapply the medicine to that area of the eyelid that softened as you did initially.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him until he is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	This is the shape of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And you should know that human eyes vary in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	So let your consideration be accordingly: the path of righteousness is not hidden from him who has a zeal for this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	On the method of cauterizing a tear duct.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, as we said in the classification of diseases, and your treatment does not bring about a cure: then it is necessary that you cauterize it in this manner.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and have an assistant hold his head with their hands so that it does not move or shake.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place a cautery of the form described below, soaked in egg white or psyllium mucilage, on his eye; then apply fire to the cautery.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	It should be a tube like the shape of an eagle's-feather quill from one end to where it is applied as a cautery; and if you wish for it to penetrate all the way through, or upwards, then make sure that side is open.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However this tube is better for your purpose.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then squeeze the fistula if it is open and extract any blood from it; dry it out thoroughly. If it isn't open then open it and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place on it a very hot cautery iron.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand with it for a moment near the cautery iron away from the eye, towards the side of the nose, so that your hand does not stray or disturb the patient; and place the cautery iron on the fat above the eye, and burn it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you reach with your cautery iron right up to the bone, it will be fine.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, should you need to; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then apply a poultice with butter, and treat it with drying ointment until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	But if forty days pass by and it does not heal: then apply over it a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what was said in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cautery for fistula, which some have previously described.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Pay attention to the place of the fistula, and find it; then put into this fissure a fine probe, that is, a slender cannula, whose form is as follows.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it an amount of molten lead weighing one drachma, and hold your hand with the cannula firmly, and do not let the patient move at all, so that he does not jump or bring the molten lead to his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place on the patient's eye a poultice soaked in egg white or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For the lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with an astonishing healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula heals with what we have said about cauterization and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal opening and redirect the fistula towards the course of the nose, as it will come to its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	The method of cauterizing labial fissures.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	There are many times when there are labial fissures, which are called 'piles', especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When you treat these fissures as we have said in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not work, then use a small knife-shaped cautery with fire according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let its depth be according to the thinness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place it, being ignited, quickly into the very fissures until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a caustic until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	The method of cauterizing an oral fistula.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When there is an abscess at the root of the gums or on the palate or at the roots of the teeth: then it makes pus and breaks open; afterwards it heals and runs with pus and becomes a fistula; then you treat it and the treatment does not work, then one must use a cautery according to its size that can fit into the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then introduce the ignited one into the hole of the fistula and hold your hand there until the heated iron reaches its depth and end: do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat the wound afterwards with what we have said regarding treatment until it heals.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore pus is cut off and heals, then that will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place, and remove the corrupted bone according to what comes into its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	The way of cauterizing gums and softened teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum softens due to dampness and teeth loosen, and you treat it with medicines but without success: then place the patient's head on your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then apply the cautery with fire, which will be formed as follows: place a tube over the tooth and insert the hot iron into it quickly; hold your hand there for a while until you feel that the patient senses heat of the fire has reached down to the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	Then lift your hand; afterwards repeat the cautery several times, according to what you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then the patient should fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it there for an hour; then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the loose tooth is strengthened, the softened gum tightened, and the corrupted dampness dried up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	The way of cauterizing for pain of teeth.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is due to cold, either there is coldness or worms inside it and treatment with medicines does not take effect; then cautery on the tooth is carried out in two ways: by applying an ointment or by means of fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	When using a cautery with butter, take fresh butter and boil it in an iron spoon or a small pot.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then get a cloth and wrap it around the end of the probe.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then dip the probe into the boiled butter and quickly place it on the painful tooth; hold it there until it cools down. Repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, dip wool or a cloth into cold butter and place it on the aching tooth; put a red-hot iron on top of this until the heat reaches deep into the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cautery method using fire involves attaching an iron or brass tube to the probe.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	If there is any thickness on its surface, make sure the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then apply the fire cautery, which has a round shape; place it on that tooth and hold your hand there until the cautery cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either that same day or the next.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And the patient should fill his mouth with good butter while keeping it pressed against the mark of the cautery for an hour; after that, he may spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whichever end you wish as possible; and this is the shape of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	On the method of cauterizing styes.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When styes are caused by phlegm and cold humours, and they do not respond to treatment with medicines, and you wish to digest them quickly: then use a concave cautery, the form of which is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	With two tight ends so that the smoke emerges from the cautery at one end; and place it, heated, on the stye once, or twice if necessary, until you reach the depth of the stye.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the stye is small, then adjust the cautery according to its size.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and apply to it a poultice soaked in butter until that which was burnt by the fire is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with tooth ointment until the shape of the tube is restored.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	On the method of cauterizing hoarseness of voice and tightness of breath.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When humours overwhelm the windpipe and especially when it is accompanied by a cold constitution, then the patient ought first to be treated with dissolving medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it at night at the root of the throat in a hollow place; and take care not to reach with the cautery into the throat or onto the skin except for one bit of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery at the joint of the neck on its last vertebra; and let this cautery be a nail-shaped one according to the model described previously.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what preceded, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	...Concerning the way of cauterizing lung disease and cough...
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When the cough and lung disease are due to cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or wasting disease, nor is it an old complaint: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in hollow, soft places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with the other cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let it be a hollow tube-shaped cautery as previously described.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish your cauterization to be by pricking with a cautery, which is called a 'Point', of the form previously described for earache pricks; and let the points be from thirty to almost forty in number.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what preceded until it is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let there be a three-pronged cautery of this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Why is the cauterization mitigated when you do with it by turn three cauteries?
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	Concerning the way of cauterizing shoulder tickling after dislocations...
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture and is not put back into place within an hour after its displacement, until it becomes accustomed to returning, then displaced by a slight motion which occurs as we have just witnessed, you should first reduce the dislocation...
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	The patient should then lie down on their back, or on their healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin that is inside the upper part of the armpit with your left hand's fingers: and if the joint is dislocated towards the inside.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then take a cautery, which has two bars.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the cauterization figure will appear with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three bars, which results in a figure of six cauteries; and the bars are made as thin as possible.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of the three-bar cautery.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one more is added to this method, resulting in eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place on the cautery crushed onions with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the patient adhere to rest so that no limb is moved until they are comfortable.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upwards, which rarely happens, then cauterize it on the shoulder with a clavicle-shaped cautery, or by puncturing multiple times with cauteries.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is made firm, moisture is removed, and the patient recovers health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	On the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When there is coldness and excessive moisture in the stomach, which has not yet been eliminated from its constitution, and catarrhs frequently form as a result of this condition, and frequent treatments are applied without benefit; then the patient must lie down on his back with legs and arms extended.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then causticate with three caustics: with a sub-conch caustic of the size of one finger on the clavicle; and two caustics below at both sides, each the size of a single caustic, until the figure of the caustics forms a triangle.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And extend [the cauterizations] so that they do not join each other; when the caustics begin to discharge pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the caustic be two-thirds [of the thickness] of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the figure of the caustics be according to this shape, without addition; and if you wish to caustic with a large caustic in the middle of the stomach, according to this shape: then let the caustic that is used for this procedure be one shaped like a circle, according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is causticated by having the area around it pricked with a small pointed instrument which has been heated red-hot; and [the process] may be done as follows: first mark on the stomach an area according to whatever size you wish, using the encaustic iron; then causticize this marked spot with a causticizing iron; afterwards treat [it] with the treatment that preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	On how to causticize a cold spleen.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When there is pain in the spleen due to coldness and moisture, or due to a thick wind, which has not yet been eliminated by its natural superfluous discharge; and the patient is treated with what we have said above, but without improvement: then he must lie down on his neck; then mark three cauterizations according to this figure and size using an encaustic iron, below the spleen from the hypocondriae where it reaches the length of a man's elbow. The distance between each caustic should be equal in width to one finger; while each caustic should have the same length as the body of the patient. Do not press your hand too hard with the causticizing iron.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And its amount that is burnt from the thickness of the skin, half the amount not added: and let it be a patient standing on his own feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, having already stretched out his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the shape of the cauterization.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And indeed it is possible for you to carry out these cauterizations with a knife-like cautery when you have skill and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard against proceeding too far in the cauterization and burning through all the thickness of the skin so that what is burnt is the whole body and it reaches the entrails, for there the skin is thin; know this therefore.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	Paragraph about the method of cauterizing hepatic abscesses.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it becomes apparent and you wish to know whether the abscess is in the liver's flesh or its membrane, then if it is in the liver's flesh there will be pain but no sharpness, while if it is in the liver's membrane with the pain comes a fierce degree of acuteness. And you see now that its cure has tired out his physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is therefore necessary for the patient to lie prone with his neck bent backwards.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Next trace the shape of the abscess with an encasutry; next take a fiery cautery that resembles a spoke.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	Cauterize it with one such cautery until all the skin is burnt and it reaches the subcutaneous tissue, until all pus emerges; then cure it as for discharging abscesses, until it is cured.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	One should not use this type of cauterization unless one's study in the art of medicine is prolonged and these illnesses have been encountered several times through the hands of that person, then indeed may they dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But as for letting her go, in my opinion, it is better for me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	§ On the method of cauterization in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that a cautery with the roots of Aristolochia for cold pleurisy should be done in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you should take from the roots of dry long Aristolochia one root longer than the others which can be found among them and is as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil, and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one large cautery at the place where the fork of the neck is joined to it and two small ones slightly sloping downwards towards that side which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two more on that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs sloping a little towards the back, another at the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three more behind the back; one at that which is between the two scapulae, and two on the sides of the chest lower down, one being between the two scapulae.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you must not press your hand with the cautery but let it be held open on the skin without pressure.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some of the ancients have said that there are those who use an iron cautery similar to a radius; they light it and insert it inside towards that which is between the ribs until they reach with it the abscess, and pus comes out as we have said for liver abscesses.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation, when cauterization is performed out of fear, either the patient dies immediately or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	On the method of cauterizing spleen head 32.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat spleen illness, as we said before from the treatment section of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then a cautery on it is performed according to three methods, which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is to make three or four cauteries in a row along the spleen's length following the shape of the liver cautery described before.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And there should be an interval between each two cauteries equal to the size of one finger or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And the method of the cautery should be as we described before for liver cauterization equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with the cautery; let the patient lie on his back supine.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method for the cauterization is to hold the two pronged cautery with fire that we described in the dislocation of shoulder chapter: and lift up the skin which is over the spleen where the patient's left elbow reaches; your lifting should be along the body width such that the cauteries fall on the body length.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert the two burning prongs until you penetrate through skin from the other side; then extract the cautery; thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you want to cauterize with another three pronged cautery.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then treat the cautery after you let it release its puss for many days; this is more effective than any other treatment described before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On the method of cauterizing for dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery should not fall on dropsy unless it is suitable for the patient.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat dropsy with the methods of treatment that we have described earlier, and if the treatment does not help, then it is necessary for you to cauterize the patient with four cauteries around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another on the liver, one on the spleen, two between the vertebrae at the back, and one each in a direct line from the breast and stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be almost equal to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the open cautery to discharge pus over a long period.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not discharge the patient from treatment after the cautery with it: which ought to have two intentions applied, and recovery will be quick with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery with which the belly is to be cauterized should be that of a key, according as its form may have been; and that of the one with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according as its form may have been.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the method of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When blisters fill with yellow water in a dropsical patient, you ought to cauterize over the back of the foot at night, which is between the little finger and ring finger; then raise your hand holding the cautery, without twisting it; next lift your hand; and do not repeat this treatment at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	It [the wound] should be washed with lemon water and a caustic should be applied in this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two caustics on the two legs, one in each leg, and make a caustic with the knife-like end of the caustic instrument; and let the caustic be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another lower down, about mid-leg. And make two caustics over the whole hip region: then leave the open caustic without any treatment for a long time so that some water oozes out from it; then treat it with what we have mentioned above.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Paragraph sign. Chapter: On the method of caustication for hernia.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the hernia has resulted from cold and moisture, weakening the retaining and digestive powers which are located in the stomach and intestines; when it is treated with methods of treatment but does not heal; and you see that the patient can bear a caustic of excessive power: then causticate on his stomach itself according to what was said earlier about causticating on the stomach with a circular cautery, and four thin cauteries around the navel, with a fine nail-shaped instrument, plus one large caustic above the alhosos or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moisture and the patient can bear it, then causticate on the spine with a single caustic and one over all of the flanks; and perhaps add two small cauteries above the stomach near the navel.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	It is an effective treatment when its benefits do not go astray [ie: it does what it says on the tin].
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Paragraph sign. Chapter: On the method of caustication for haemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus or just one that is formed from thick fluids and cold or corrupted moistures, and treatment with what has been said above does not work; then cauterize it with three cauteries on the lower vertebra of the back below the waistline to a small triangular shape and another underneath the navel almost as large as two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think his stomach is being cooled down and food is not digesting properly, and you see the face breaking out in spots then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery according to what has been said before; another one above the Epar (gall bladder) of that person, another over their Spleneum (spleen), along with a clavicle cautery: and leave the open cautery for some time; afterwards cure them until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	The method of cauterizing hemorrhoids after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise the hemorrhoids then light up a cautery that is similar in size to a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the lit cautery into the excised hemorrhoid; and your last hand should reach to where the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows; do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore the hemorrhoids be many then cauterize each one with a cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Afterwards cure them with what works for them from the ointments until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize them with a large cautery over the Alcatin (bladder) then it is more beneficial as a final treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	The method of cauterizing a fistula in ano.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the incision and operation that we have described in its proper place, and is afraid of it, he is perhaps cured with a cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore it happens to someone that they get a fistula, and it becomes old, pus runs out of it, and corrupted moistness.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is therefore appropriate to examine it with a thin probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the depth of it with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then light up a cauterization iron, which is similar in size (to the fistula).
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then introduce the heated iron into the fistula itself, and (introduce it) as much as the probe entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cauterization over it, until they burn all those corrupted bodies (i.e., pus and moistness), once or twice or three times according to the amount that you need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And take care to avoid burning the nerve, if it is there or a large vein; or if the fistula enters into the body of the bladder, or the body of the intestine, then take care to avoid these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do it (i.e., cauterization) unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place becomes sealed, and substances separate from it (i.e., dry out), and remain like that for a long time; then know that it is now entirely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	If it does not cut away the material from it, then know that it is penetrating or there is a rotten bone deep inside, or something like this happens among those [instances]: whose recollection will come to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterizing kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When there is pain in the kidneys due to cold or heavy wind and it diminishes because of weak constitution, you must cauterize them over almethenem on top of the kidneys themselves with a clavicle-shaped cautery previously mentioned.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time at the very almeidatu.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why will three lines appear.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore, the last one will be more helpful.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing bladders.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture until the patient is unable to retain urine, you must then cauterize it on the lower part of suminis over the bladder where hair starts growing with a cautery from the right side of suminis and another one from its left; this cauterization should be as long as the width of a thumb; and cauterize with a cautery of the lower back or two cauteries if needed: and use the clavicle-shaped cautery previously mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing wombs.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and it is prevented from conception, and her menses are corrupted, and their onset is delayed, and she experiences pain around the time of their arrival, then she ought to be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said in vesical cauterization, and one cautery below the back on the buttock, or two cauteries; and let the cautery be a clavicle.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	The method of cauterizing an ankle when it is dislocated: you should incise between the tendons, and insert the iron between them, so that the flesh may be opened with a chisel. It must then be cauterized from below, not from above; otherwise there will ensue much loss of blood and tissue mortification, and perhaps gangrene may follow.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42: On the cauterization of the uterus for sterility, when conception does not take place because it is too narrow or tight. If we judge that this condition exists in a woman who has been married for some time without bearing children (which is often the case with virgins), and if her husband desires to have offspring, she should be cauterized on the navel. And let there be three cauteries around it, one above it between the breasts, another below, in the pubic area; two at each side near the hips. All these ought to be of medium size.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous moistures are poured out onto the ankle bone, and become the cause of its exiting from its place: and its sign is that the leg is extended over the other when they are compared together, and the site of the dislocation is found to be empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary that the sick person be cauterized over the ankle bone with a similar round cautery; after you have marked with the encaustic around the ankle bone as it turns, and so that the ankle itself falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of that shape which preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	But if you do not have this cautery available, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of all the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat him until he recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the way of cauterizing for sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the hip joint and its cause is coldness and dampness; and when treating the patient with what we have said in our division (of causes), it does not help and it gets worse: then you should treat the patient by removing excess humours using fetid pills, or artificial pills, and their likes.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization on it is according to two methods: either a cauterization with medicines that burn, or a cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is that you cauterize over the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations, according to this form: [please see reference material for image]
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them deep or shallow as appropriate.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let there be the space between every two cauterizations equal to the thickness of a finger, and also anoint it with oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes there is a cauterization right on top of the hip joint.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Because they are four in number.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, which preceded the form of cauterization for hip dislocation, one must do it so that the circle contains the whole joint.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn all the thickness of the skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery for sciatica, when the pain adheres to the hip itself and does not extend down to the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If, however, the pain extends down to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, over the place where the patient indicates that the pain is, and perform cautery on your own forearm four fingers from the wrist towards the elbow: and let the cautery be a lancet-type.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient indicates that the pain extends down to near the toes, then cauterize it there where they indicate with a puncture cautery, three or four times, or more if needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if they indicate that the pain is beneath the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with a single lancet-type cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And be careful in all your cauterizations that you do not push the cautery so far as to burn a nerve or large artery, and cause great harm or contraction to the patient.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I myself have seen one or two who cauterized on the forearm and went too far in their cauterization, and the leg became inflamed until swelling reached the foot, and it was perforated all over, and the whole foot became gangrenous: then they suffered a rupture of the bowels, and death followed.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If pain is present in two places at once, cauterize each place according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise people have said about the cauterization of the hip, for which this is the method:
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar [instrument] out of iron, its diameter being half the width of a palm; and at its opening let it be as thick as the core of a finger or slightly less: and within this instrument, insert another small one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space between each instrument be the length of the knot of a thumb; and let the instruments be open on two sides; and let their height be that of a knuckle, or two knuckles; and make for them an off-centre iron handle fitted to the instruments.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it should be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks; then place it on a jar of weak vinegar with the afflicted lying propped up on one side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Cauterize him, therefore, with three round cauteries in succession.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards, apply plasters with butter; and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says of this kind of cauterization, my sons, we have made little use of it because of the fearfulness of its appearance; and also because there are few who can bear to wait for it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless, this is one of the good cauterizations for him who endures it, and he will find its place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But for cauterization with medicated oils you should make two instruments that have a pierced collar into which descends the hinge of its door made from brass or iron, the length of its wall; whose height is two knuckles, or as much again.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	There should be a space equal to the thickness of two fingers between them, and they should remain open both above and below; and let there be such that they hold themselves in place according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on an anchor-shaped pillow, with the patient lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly over the anchor-shaped pillow.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles warm water that has been heated over a fire for a short while, and keep it there for about an hour: and let the patient bear its biting and burning, since he finds the bite like fire, until the bite quiets down.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe off warm water from the whole anchor with fresh water: then remove it after three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter over it until the blackness of burning is removed: and leave it for several days, and you will find that it oozes with pus.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For this is the last thing in the cure.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it gets healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	But if the pain extends to the hip or leg: make for him an appliance containing water in that place, just as you made it for the anchor equaly.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the way of warm water: and I have already written it down in my book about correcting medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take an equal part of each of alkali and unslaked lime: pound both, and put them in a new pot whose lower part is pierced with one small hole according to the size that will fit inside it radius: and place under the bottom of this pot another worn-out pot: and pour over the alkali and lime fresh water so as to cover both by about an inch: after which you press these down with your hand firmly: and leave the pot until cold water runs into the lower part of the worn-out pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then pour all that water in, and throw it over another lime; and let it be boiled until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	It will then be very strong caustic, which is applied in many medical operations and for the cauterizing of other parts of the body.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it brings about the action of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And they are among the medications with which warts and corns are cauterized, as well as thesisie, and nut butter, and lime combined with soap so that both may be mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	Galen indeed has related the cure of a certain man among the ancients, by which he was cured of pain in the wart and sciatic vein; and he extolled it as being very efficacious.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that he needed no other cure and was healed by a single application until he related that perhaps the man entered the bath while being carried in and came out of it already cured.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is to be taken from fresh green nut butter; and if not found green, take the dry kind, when new: and grind it a great deal with some fat and place it on the wart where there is pain, or on the leg, or on the hip; and bind it, and leave it on for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels that the burning has lessened.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When his body becomes moist, put him onto a couch.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain goes away, and he is cured.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you should know that no one ought to use the cautery with these medications unless after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that goat dung, when used to cauterize the sciatic vein, benefits it; and the cautery is done in this manner.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Wool should be taken and soaked in old oil, then placed on the deep spot located between the big toe and the one next to it.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung and set it on fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place [the charcoal] on the wool and leave it there until it goes out.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat this process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	You should not stop doing this until feeling returns through the intervention up to the hip joint, and pain stops.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called the Goat Dung Cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	On the cauterization for back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Back pain sometimes occurs due to many causes—be it from a fall or a blow; over-evacuation, and similar things, such as the infusion of cold, moist matter: cauterization is not suitable except in this one case that results from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	After evacuation, it is necessary to apply fetid pills and similar things over the back where there is pain, in three lines according to the length of the patient's arm; once you have marked five cauteries or more along each line depending on how much comes out due to the tolerance of the patient's strength: and perform cauterization using a brand.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauterizations using a claviform iron in the middle, following this pattern.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	A description of cauterization at the beginning of a hernia operation.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often occurs in young children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning is, among children, that a painful sensation occurs when they take a breath at the moment of elevation or movement; and you find in their last vertebra of the spine and its knots which has now started to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you see it in this way and wish to operate on it then cauterize with an iron that is circular according to the following pattern.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And the iron should touch every part of the vertebra evenly; and if you wish to cauterize around its circumference use an iron that is two or three lines long for puncturing; and have these holes close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the place until it is healed with what we described before.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware of applying the iron to a hernia which is formed from a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	A description of cauterization for gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are from cold humidity which is poured into any part of the body, then when they occur in the feet it is customary for physicians to call this gout specifically.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When gout caused by cold is treated with therapeutic methods and pain does not subside, then the cautery removes it.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And so you cauterize him after evacuation around the joints of the feet with multiple cauteries; and let the cautery be olive-oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose form is this.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if it be necessary that you make a puncture above the surface of the foot, then do so with a cautery point.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	But if the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it over every knee with three cauteries, or four on each side, with this same cautery instrument of 'clavili'.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If you require more of these cauteries, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather make it about the thickness of the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pain ascends to the knees and back, then apply what we have said from the cautery in its own chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pain is in the hands only, then make a puncture around the joints where two lines rotate.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if any of the pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, over every knuckle a puncture, and on the palm.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pain ascends after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both on all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not discharge the sick person from their good regimen, or from taking medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good diet is followed and phlegm is evacuated, it will heal with the help of God using this caustic.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Regarding the method of cauterizing ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groins and the intestine descends or drops towards the testicle and is about to come close to it, then you should tell the patient to omit eating on that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him take some laxatives so that his feces will come down from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then have him sit between your hands on his back and tell him to hold his breath until the testicle or intestine comes out or appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then draw it back with your fingers and cauterize under the rupture on the pectineal bone with a mark whose end is like half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then heat this cautery with the following shape until it becomes white and sheds sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then bring back the intestine or testicle to its place.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the assistant put his hand on that place so that the intestine does not come out and you have now opened between the patient's legs and placed a pillow underneath him and another servant under his legs while another is over his chest holding the hands of the patient.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you reach the bone with it or repeat with another one if you have not reached the bone with this one.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And be mindful to observe from the exit of the intestine during your cauterisation, lest you burn it and bring about for the patient either death or great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And be aware that when you do not achieve with the cautery the desired effect on the bone, your operation will be of no benefit.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	The cautery for infants must be fine in size, according to their measurements.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then tend to the rest of the ointments until it is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	Let the patient lie on their back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	You should provide nourishment for the duration of their treatment that soothes their stomach; so that it does not leave the intestine during their effort and expulsion.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when they wish to rise after forty days, you must apply a ligature that is loosely made, and have them wear it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	They should be restricted from labour, and overfilling of food and drink, and loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when one follows this regimen, they will heal with a complete recovery.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I shall speak of the treatment of ruptures with incisions in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen and are beginning to form, and you wish they not be added to, then cauterise their rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burnt be like a third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then tend to it with what we have said: and it will not be added to.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some say that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular-shaped cautery instrument like this.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	Once it is sealed with the encaustic, a line is drawn across the width of the upper side of the rupture and another line on the lower side.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	Place your hand in the middle with the handle of the cautery instrument.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Paragraph on how to cauterize bruises caused by falling or being struck.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When there is pain in some limbs caused by falling or being struck, and that pain persists for a long time without any improvement with medicinal treatment, then it should be treated by cauterization with the point-cautery instrument.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	The choice of the cautery instrument for each limb should be according to its size, and taking into account its weakness, strength, the position of the injury, and the severity of the pain.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If it is healed by the first application of the cautery, then that's good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, repeat with the same instrument.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For it is usual for this type of pain to move from one limb to the adjoining one.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	That is why you should follow them with the cautery instrument until the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Paragraph on how to treat leprosy by cauterization.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Leprous people are sometimes aided by cauterization to a great extent.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the kind of leprosy that is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you want to cauterize it, consider this.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore the leprosy is in its beginning, and you have treated it with that which we said in the section on divisions, and it has not descended nor stayed still: and you fear for the affected person, lest corruption should spread throughout their whole constitution: then cauterize them on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the skull, a second below this towards the front at the end of the hair, and two above the two corners, and one behind over the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And lastly hold your hand with the cautery for a short while, until it imprints a small impression in the bone, and the cortex is dislocated from it: so that exhalation of gross vapors from it may be eased, and cauterize also over the spleen itself with a cautery as previously described.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy is already spread over the affected person and appears manifestly: then you must cauterize with these cauteries, which we mentioned in the head, and with a cautery on the end of the nose, and two cauteries on the two jaws, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one over the coccyx, and one above it, at the almeidati; and two on the hips: that is, with one on each hip, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the chest muscles: and cauterize them over every joint, from the joints of their hands and feet: and cauterize over every heel of their feet, and palms of their hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are above the back of the heel so as not to burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with one cauterizing iron over the breastbone, and another over the stomach, and yet another over the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And you must know that the more you apply the cautery iron, the greater is its benefit and aid.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you should know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery iron as do healthy people because their body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that there be cautery irons of various sizes and shapes according to the members and joints as was shown previously in regard to instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care that the cautery iron is covered with the powder of herbs mixed with honey, as well as the other treatment until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the method of cautery for unconsciousness.
Caput L.	Chapter 50.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When any member is numb and it is treated with medicines, oils, or plasters but does not heal then cauterize the affected member with a suitable-sized cautery iron according to its size or smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery iron barely go through the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes a certain kind of numbness that happens to the hand or foot is cauterized at the vertebrae of the spine where the nerves that move those members come out and the numbness will be moved.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	Indeed, do not presume to operate on it unless you are wise in anatomy and the exit of the nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On cauterizing in albaras.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When you want to reopen an albaras and do not add anything from the arts of medicine to it: then cautiously apply a deep cautery to it in moderation according to the thickness of the skin until its whiteness is removed and its colour changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a paste of herb flour and lentils mixed with rose oil and arnoglossae leaves, and the blood of pigeon and swallow; each ingredient must be in equal parts. Mix all these ingredients together, apply them to a cloth and let them adhere until healing has occurred.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the method of cauterization for cancerous growths.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When cancer is just starting out and you want to stop its progression, then apply a circular-shaped cautery around it in the same way that a circle revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	The wise have said that one should apply the strongest possible cautery in the middle [of the cancer].
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	I myself do not think so, because I fear it might get ulcerated; and indeed I have seen this happen on several occasions.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to apply the cautery around its circumference with a circle, as we said; or with multiple cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterization for abscesses.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an Adobelat (swelling) that is slow to mature, either due to the superfluity of its cause or because of the patient's age and feebleness having little blood flow, or due to time constraints and the need for haste in maturing the swelling, then cauterize around it with multiple small cauteries by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it alone.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten itself with its own maturing.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then fire the cautery which is of this form: [an image or figure would be inserted here].
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the swelling until it penetrates the skin; and let this cautery be prepared from what follows according to the patient's ability to withstand pain so as to alleviate the course of pus.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the method of cauterizing for corrosive sores.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 45.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corrosive sore is but the corruption of an ulcer walking in a limb eating it away; like fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If you see a corrosive sore in a place that can tolerate being cauterized with fire, then burn it away with fire using many small and large nails according to what is appropriate for the site of the corrosive sore.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all sides until you eradicate the entire corruption, leaving no trace of it whatsoever.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it alone for three days, and place powdered sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized spots until all scabs and corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born without corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cautery on what remains of the affected areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And corrosive medicines are sometimes treated with sharp medicines.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it arises in the place of the cautery itself.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, the cautery with fire is of quicker assistance: and I have already spoken of its cauterisation with sharp medicine above: so take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cauterising wens and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Frequently this ailment occurs in the lower parts of the foot: and it is a gross, filtered thing that injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed there is cautery on them in two ways: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	However much with fire is like a cautery bowl similar to an eagle's feather: which is made of iron, according to the size that contains a nail on every side: and let its edges be fine.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it heated over the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the nail until you reach the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days until it starts to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply plasters made with crushed myrtle leaves and salt to it; leave the plaster on overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	It will indeed be removed from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with generative ointment until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not converted and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then apply hot water cauterization to them; it is advisable that you take a pipe made out of brass or iron or an eagle's feather: put this over coals or charcoal.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of hot water into the pipe; hold your hand and rotate it with some force for a short while so that you seal off the opening of the pipe at the end of the coal, and let the hot water find its way down to the root of the nail: have the patient wait there a little while over the bite of the hot water for about an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it be; the nail will indeed be removed with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this one after the other until you have covered all of them on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat those areas with something that generates flesh from ointments once they have been removed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the method of cauterization for tremors.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When someone suffers from tremors as a result of cold nerves or quartan fever or other causes: then you should cauterize them with four or five cauterizations over the vertebrae and between each vertebra one, and in their chest one, and on their stomach another.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	The tremor subsides with olive oil cauterization and healing is hastened for cold ailments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cauterizing, according to Albucasis.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes the foul material, that is, pus, which forms from corrupted coarse matter, is expelled from the body according to Albucasis.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, it is necessary that when they first appear, the small pustules on top of the head should be cauterized with a myrtle stick whose end has been ignited by fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a small bean-shaped cauterizing instrument.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized when the matter is first discharged according to this method; and they do not increase but rather the superfluity which forms them is ruptured and they heal over.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it should be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the method of cauterizing an arterial bleeding wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that there is bleeding from an artery which has been cut at the wound site or during the incision of an abscess or cauterization of a limb and similar cases; and it becomes difficult to stop this bleeding.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When this happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery and place your index finger over it; and press on it very hard until the flow of blood is stopped under your finger and nothing comes out from there.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place the small olive oil cautery into the fire, and add several more large ones; blow on them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery is torn, and place the cautery on that vein; then remove your finger quickly, and hold the cautery until the blood stops flowing.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If blood spouts out when you lift your finger from the artery opening and the cautery goes out, then quickly take another cautery from those that are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not stop doing this with one after another until the blood is stopped.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, so as not to bring about another evil on the afflicted person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, it cannot be stopped, especially if the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or by extraction if it has not been extracted already.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is pulled out, its ends contract and the blood stops flowing.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or bind it with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or place on it medicines with the property of stopping blood, and compress them with a suitable bandage.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever administers the stopping of bleeding with a thread and compression using cloth, or the application of burning objects and cauteries, should not bring them close except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If it happens to someone and they have no doctor nor medicine present, then they should start by placing the index finger over the vein opening itself as we mentioned earlier, and applying significant pressure until blood flow is restricted from the upper part of the wound as well as the artery above it.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	The finger should not be removed from the wound but remain on top of it with cold water of intense freezing constantly until the blood becomes frozen and swollen so that it can be severed.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	During this time one should observe what is needed: either cauterization or medicine.

Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Book on Surgery by Albucasis, Part 2.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On incision, perforation, and phlebotomy of wounds and similar injuries.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	In the first chapter we already mentioned every disease where it is appropriate to use a burning cautery with medicine and its opportunities, causes, instruments, and types of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And there I listed the topics from head to toe.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And now I will proceed with the same path in this chapter so as to alleviate the seeker's inquiry.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin it is necessary that you learn, my son, what differentiates this chapter from the terror of cauterization mentioned in the first chapter.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for this reason one must be even more cautious as the operation described in this chapter often leads to an evacuation of blood alongside which life depends when opening a vein, or performing an incision on an abscess, or a perforation intended for healing wounds, or extracting arrows and stones, and similar procedures; all of which cause trembling, fear, and among many death.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you not to stumble over that which causes hesitation, for sometimes people of various kinds with various illnesses fall to you in this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For among them are those who become angry when ill and for whom death is a light matter due to the severity of what they experience from their illness and the length of their suffering.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when ill, it is out of fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is the one who offers his musician and enriches you with him, hoping for health, while his illness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, you ought not to agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more severe than your greed and avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume anything about him until after certain knowledge that verifies for you what the successful outcome attains.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And apply to the treatment of all your patients a prognosis and an indication that will lead suitably to their health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that is your help concerning the attainment of fame and glory, memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding, and may he not withdraw from you guidance and inspiration, for it is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have indeed arranged this chapter by dividing it into sections, as has been done previously in the chapter on cauterization from the neck down to the feet, so that your search for what you wish and need out of it may be alleviated.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	The treatment of water accumulation in children's heads.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You know that this illness often befalls children at birth; or when the midwife grasps the child's head without care.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it happens also for an unknown cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I myself have not seen this sickness in anyone other than children; and among all those whom I saw it rushed towards death; because of that vision, therefore, it seemed to me to give up operating on them.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I myself saw among them a child whose head was filled with water, and the head swelled every day until he could not sit up because of the size of his head; and humidity increased in it until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture either accumulates between the skin and bone; or it accumulates beneath the skull above the brain.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation for this, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make an incision in the middle of the head as wide as your finger; and let its length be about two fingers long until moisture flows out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the shape of a spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two such incisions there.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and its sign is that you see the cranial sutures open from every side; and water is depressed when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and it is not hidden from you: then you should make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract all moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the wounds with cloth and lint.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	After that, irrigate it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the binding, and treat the wound with stitches and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not stop binding the head in moderation.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	Feed the patient dry food of little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to note where the size of the abscess appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is more on the occipital bone, or on the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So ascend with the incision where the abscess and water collection appear to you, and split it as best you can.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, do not cut the artery, for a flow of blood may occur and the patient will die from that flux with evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	On the Incision of the Arteries which lie behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When someone has catarrh which affects the eyes or chest, and is not healed by medicinal treatment, then this ultimate cure lies therein, the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore when you wish to make an incision on them, it is necessary that the patient bow their head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then scrape the place with a rough cloth until the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then have the patient strap their neck tightly using any piece of cloth available to them.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Next, take note where the pulse in the vein is felt.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And these places where the pulse is felt are areas behind the ears that are depressed (sunken); and it is rarely not felt there except for some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark both sides with an encaustic (hot wax seal); and cut each side to a depth of two-fingerbreadths using the knife on either side, making the cuts right up to the bone; and make this incision as wide across as the breadth of your head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the knife beneath the artery and cut it open above with an upward stroke.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	Let the length of the incision be as wide as two fingers side by side.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut open, the blood will come gushing out in a pulse that will leap up towards you with frequent spurts.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not feel apparent to your touch, then you should measure three fingerbreadths away from the ear.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with an encaustic (hot wax seal) and make your way right up to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what needs to be let out in terms of blood volume is six ounces; perhaps you will let more or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	The whole of it (the amount bled) should be in proportion to the strength apparent in the patient, as well as the fullness of his arteries.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Next, pay attention to the wound (the cut).
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	If any bone remains exposed after the incision, then cut it away so that a hot abscess does not form; then bind the wound with linen cloths.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a man suffers from chronic hemicrania or acute catarrh on account of acrid humidities and heat in the regions of the temples, or an old headache, intense and similar to these, and it is treated with the methods of medical cure without avail: then we have found in these ailments the extraction of arteries from the temples or their cauterization, as we have related.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the manner of operating for their extraction is this: the patient should have his hairs shaved off where the temple shows blue.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it shows itself to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few persons or extreme cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	And if it is hidden from you, then the patient should bind his head with any of his own cloths; then rub the place with a coarse cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or else fomentation of the place should be made by means of hot water until it shows itself to you in a visible manner.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula which I have just made.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape away the skin with it gently until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then thrust a hook into it and extract it upwards until you have pulled it out of the skin and made it emerge from beneath its tunics on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is slender: then wrap it with the extremity of a hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it a portion according to the quantity by which its extremities are extended, and they contract, and no bleeding will occur.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not fully recede.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then draw out six ounces of blood from it until three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then you must tie it in two places with double thread, strong, of silk: or from cords of aloe, so that it does not hasten to itself putrefaction before wound healing, and bleeding occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut the excess, which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at this hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with the cautery until bone, with the knife-like cautery: until its extremities are cauterized, and will stand in place of that same work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better work, unless the patient has fever, or is of hot constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cautery is among those things which help to dry up moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better assistance.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the removal of arteries, that the place be filled with old tallow: and decently made poultices are placed on top.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the filling is cured with dry medicines that make flesh grow, and with lint, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If in the meantime, while you are operating, there occurs a flow of blood from an artery, then hurry to cut it off with a cauterizer or fill the place with zegi: and squeeze your hand until the bleeding stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those are available to you then put your finger on the spot until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And irrigate the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides and it tightens as needed.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And for that which is lighter and easier to remove by way of the artery, it is done with this two-bladed cautery; let the sharpness of the two blades be like alum.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp like two knives, it hastens both coldness; and it doesn't cut the flesh quickly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Since there is a little roughness in them, the fire's heat is retained in them and it cuts flesh quickly; with this one, therefore, the operation is better than any other, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger; after you mark two spots with encaustic; and place both very hot until they reach the bone, and cut into the vein at two points so that what is between its ends will stretch out.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not heal completely with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On treating the incessant flow of sharp tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter Four.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears are continuous and their flow comes from the veins which are on the exterior of the skull above the head; and you don't apply any medical cure or medicine to them, and you see that the patient's face is already red, and he feels crawling in his forehead, like the crawling of ants: and his eyes are strained, wet so much that their lashes are already corroded with corrosion; and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of tears: then ancient physicians required this operation for their cure, and they named it a cure *with the Sword*.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And you should advise the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead along its length; and let the length of each incision be about two fingers, and let one incision be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the temples, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are on both sides; and stretch your hand away from the joining of the two jaws, and let all the space of the incision be as long as three joined fingers; and have ready for you a piece of sponge, or many dry pieces of cloth, with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a spatula of two sharp ends, whose following shape is as follows:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the first incision which is on the side of the temple, to the second incision; and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, together with the sinew that is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do it again from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this spatula and introduce into the first incision again another instrument called a sharp scalpel on one side, blunt and not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with skin, and its blunt side towards the bone; then push it until you reach the mid-fissure; and cut through all the sinews that descend from the head to the eye: except where the incision is continued up to that which appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then make it in the mid-fissure up until another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after an equal quantity of blood runs out, press the places from clots of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every fissure old linen from cotton, and put on them compresses soaked in wine or oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see to it that no hot abscess occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day dissolve the ligature, and apply a large quantity of lotion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with the ointment known as basilicon, and other things which are used to heal wounds until they are healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	On the treatment of acute tears and catarrh in the eyes from internal head conditions.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When someone suffers from acute, sharp, frequent catarrh and you see his eyes are tired, small, and their appearance is already weakened; and the eyelids have become ulcerated, hair falls out of them, and there is a sharp, painful headache in the depths of the head with sneezing afterwards: then take as your starting point for these symptoms that those substances and catarrh do not come but from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And this is a better cure for them.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it's best to advise the patient to shave their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make an incision in the forehead, one in the middle or slightly off-center and across its width; start with a fissure from the left temple to the right, making sure it reaches the bone beneath. Extend your hand out as far as the temples move when chewing until you feel the bone. Then dry all of the blood away using a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision using an old rag or linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Afterwards, bind it from above with lint; dip the lint in a mixture of wine and oil to avoid hot abscesses.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you remove the binding and see that the hot abscess has shrunk, it is necessary to rub the bone until flesh starts growing over it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Afterwards treat it with a drying regimen that makes flesh grow; such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and prepare from them a plaster to be applied at the birth of flesh on these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On treating what has fallen into the ear:
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Anything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a mineral substance like a stone; or something similar to a stone such as iron and its filings; or it comes from plants, such as chickpeas and beans; or it's a fluid-like material like water, vinegar and things like them; or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When a stone falls into the ear, or a piece of rock from those that are not added to, nor grow in the ear, expose the Ear to the sun; if you then see the stone, drop into the Ear a little of either violated oil, or sesame oil.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then perform its extraction, and make him sneeze with the medicine, and hold his nostrils shut at the approach of the sneeze, after you put around the ear a piece of cloth or wool, and stretch out the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For indeed it often comes out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not come out, then perform its extraction with forceps, that is, fine tweezers; whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	Therefore if it comes out with the forceps, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then perform its extraction with a thin blunt hook of little curvature.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If it does not come out by that, then make a brass pipe and insert the end of the pipe deep into the ear-hole, and plug what is around the pipe with softened wax mixed with oil so that there be no way for the wind but through the pipe; then draw it forth with your strong suction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For indeed it often comes out with what we have narrated.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not come out that way: then take some fish-skin or from glue, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught, a little piece; and put it at the end of a stick after you wrap around it an untrimmed cloak; then insert it into the earhole easily, after you dry the ear of moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If it does not exit with all that we have described, then proceed to cutting before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	The method of the incision is such that you should use a lancet on the patient's head first; and draw out blood according to the measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and find a small incision in the root of his ear near its fat at that depressed spot; and let the incision be of lunar shape until you reach the bone; then remove it with what is possible for you from among your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then suture the incision with your needle swiftly, and take care of it until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If the thing that fell into his ear is one of the grains which grow and swell; then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not obey you by coming out, then take a thin, fine spatula in this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the abscission of that kind from grains which fall into the ear, and do not do this when you think that the grain has been moistened by the vapour of the ear until you have tried many times; then draw them out with hooks or with a fine probe or with suction as we said, for its extraction will be made easier.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the case of water which enters the ear, the patient must use sneezing first; and then fill his ear with some old oil; and lie on that ear in which is the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it therefore comes out by that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin and soft, and heat them with fire for a while; and let the patient introduce one of these into their ear hole: and let him leap upon his foot on that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore he will not stop doing that with stone and stone until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now water comes out like this, you will take a piece of papyrus or reed and introduce one end into the ear; light the other end with fire until most of it is burnt.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat with another reed and do this many times until all the water comes out; and extract it with a tube as previously mentioned for stones.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	But for the extraction of an animal that has entered it, if it is a small body like a flea or similar, take care as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body which can be felt; then apply forceps and hooks to its extraction; and this procedure is easier than all those for things lodged inside the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	But for the extraction of worms generated inside the ear, when you treat it with what we have said before in the division and in the chapter on distillations; if your treatment does not help then you must look at the patient's ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	So if you see anything there of the worms, then extract it with forceps or fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing is seen there; then take a tube with this form, narrow at the bottom and wide on top; introduce its thin end into the ear as far as it can go; then suck hard upon it.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you at the end, then apply oil around the pipe with leather, as I said on page 32.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not leave with what we have said, then administer the distillations that the ancients already experienced in worm killing: and you will find it in the treatise of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring be such that you pour the oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it from silver or bronze, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, wide at the top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Therefore, let it be so that the driver which is in the cavity of the pipe, is off-centre and made from bronze.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a stick and wrap some cotton around one end with an appropriate number of turns; then pour oil or juice or any medicine from these into the pipe, and let it be inserted into the ear; then insert the stick with the wrapped cotton on top and squeeze it with your hand using moderate pressure until the oil is driven into the cavity of the ear, and the patient feels it inside; and whatever you put in the ear, let it already have been heated by fire for a short time: and beware that what is distilled into this should not be very cold: for medicines cannot tolerate such things.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of blockage in an auricular prosthesis.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes children emerge from the abdomen of their mothers unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And now it also happens to some men that wax builds up in the ear canal due to injury or flesh growing there.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	This wax buildup sometimes occurs deep inside the ear canal, where it cannot be seen; and at other times it happens closer to the outside of the ear, where it can indeed be seen.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which occurs deep inside the ear and cannot be seen is often difficult to heal in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And for that wax which can be seen, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and look into it; then, if you see the visible wax, open it up with a thin spatula, whose shape is as follows, with its end having a small width, of which one part is sharp: and let the rest of the spatula have two gentle sides: so that it does not harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	So if the wax is caused by flesh growing inside the ear canal: then hold it with a thin hook and cut it out easily until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	But if the wax is deep inside the ear then take a thin, gentle rod and warm it slightly over a fire; next put it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you feel wax with that rod which the patient has trouble hearing, try opening it up gently; and be careful not to injure the ear's nerve.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Next put into the ear some linen rolled up in Egyptian ointment according to the size of the opening; do this for a few days until you are sure the wound has healed.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take some linen and soak it in rose water; then sprinkle on it some powdered frankincense, and use this.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear has already formed an abscess: then you must remove the pus and allow it to remain with another linen cloth that you wrap in a poultice made with rose oil until the abscess becomes warm; afterwards treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If there is bleeding, then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear; use the rest of the treatment that stops bleeding as mentioned earlier in the chapter on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Regarding the treatment for inflammation of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These inflammations of the eyelids that occur on the eye sometimes are wet, and sometimes they are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore it is necessary that you hold them with forceps or with a hook, and cut them out with a small spatula from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then put on the affected areas some crushed egg white.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If there is bleeding from them, then cauterize them with a thin lens-shaped cautery tool.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterizing after cutting is better.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots get burnt, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Regarding the treatment for styes on the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	It often happens in the eyelids that there is something like a sty in its strength and hardness; because of this it is called a stye, which is a collection of thick humours on either eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation for these patients is as follows: you must consider it then, if there is a progressing granuloma that appears on the eyelid and moves to any area, and its condition is easy to treat.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore find over it an incision of appropriate width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape away the tissue on all sides with ease until it emerges.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Next lift it up using a hook, then cut it away.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	However if you cannot cut it away unless after you have made an incision into the eyelid itself, then this will harm the patient in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If however the incision is large then stitch it together with sutures and treat until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment restores it and causes it to flesh over.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the granuloma declines towards the inner surface of the ear then turn the eyelid inside out and lift up the granuloma with a hook; although you will need an incision, press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If however the eyelid is lengthened by incision then this will not harm it at all.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after this granuloma incision with salt water and treat the site of the flesh-over until the patient is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On treating swelling of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a build-up of fat beneath the skin of the upper eyelid which most often occurs in children; it burdens their eyes and brings cataracts upon them in the morning when they cannot look at sunlight due to how tears rush into their eyes, for this reason you see them always leaning over on their faces and sleeping upon those, and there are wet eyelids under their eyebrows that have been covered by swelling. The Axirnath prominence is apparent to the eye; when you press the site with your fingers you feel axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	The method for this operation is to have the patient place their head on your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare it with lint; make from this lint a circle according to the size that fits around 'Axinam' on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on top and press with your fingers from all sides so that 'Axinam' gathers at the center of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find at the center of that moisture with a pointed spatula any cracks across its width; do not let the crack be larger than what is made during phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or you should cut the skin entirely until you reach 'Axinam', as in many instances 'Axinam' proceeds from a crack according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract it therefore with a cloth which you have inserted between your fingers towards the exterior; and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed: be careful not to add anything into the crack such that you do not reach the eye with the pointed spatula and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If however 'Axinam' does not appear to you at the start of the crack, you should add a little with care until 'Axinam' proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, place them on the spot, and bind it with compresses.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	There are those among men who rub salt and place it on the hollow of the crack so that what remains of that moisture may liquify.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however there is a warm abscess in that place, then treat it with soothing poultices until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	On the ways of eye droop, that is, when the eyelid softens around the eye, causing it to sag as it shouldn't.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When additional hairs grow on the eyelids beyond the normal course of hair growth and turn white: these are harmful to the eye and can cause conditions such as persistent tears, eyelid softening, and whiteness until the eye is destroyed.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	Eye droop is treated in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, as mentioned earlier in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or eye droop is treated by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with tubes, as I will explain.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You should place the patient's head on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it turns easily, that's good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	If not, insert the needle into it with the thread attached from the lower part of the eyelid and make the needle penetrate upwards with the thread, near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow: then draw the thread upwards on the eyelid and turn it back with a rod.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner part of the eyelid beneath the hairs with a spatula inserted from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth beneath the eyelid; then mark over the eyelid with cauterization in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the shape be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: for it varies greatly among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there are those who require that an extensive portion of the eyelid be cut away according to the size that is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with the spatula find over the two lines that you have marked and begin from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct, and let there be one incision close to the natural hairs like the thickness of a needle.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce a hook into one of two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape it all away.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture of fine thread and needle: wipe away any blood and make adhere what remains of the threads above the eyebrows with some sticky substances if you wish to do so; but if not, pay it no mind.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads for three or four days; afterwards take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without suture and care for it with something that dries and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is elevated at the wound's seal and its bringing together; but it will be better still.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancients taught this method of healing.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is concern for the patient, and it comes from good work, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	Another method is also described by Albucasis: it involves making a mark on the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have explained.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate or combined hooks according to this shape that follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors following this shape, with an even cut.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If you cannot hold the hook and it does not fit evenly: take a needle with thread on it and insert it in the middle of the shape; then insert another thread near the larger lachrymal, and a second thread near the smaller lachrymal; and gather together the threads between your fingers with an even pull.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand evenly; and lift the skin over where the boil is marked, as we have explained.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches; and look after it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If a boil occurs at your incision or your wound: treat the boil with caustic substances and similar things, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens that the eyelid turns its hairs inwards.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is therefore necessary to use what we have said about the incision; but stitching is more artificial for both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On Albucasis' treatment with reeds.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And so, turn over the eyelid and split open the inner incision as I have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then you will take two reeds or thin sticks and make them into canes of a length equal to that of the eyelid, their width being narrower than a spathe. And already have made incisions at both ends in which you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then bring together each one carefully over what is left of the eyelid and tightly bind both canes on either side with a tight strapping; leave this for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	The skin will die off, shrivel up, and rot away until it falls by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If this is delayed then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until the wound heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	As soon as this has healed up, lift the eyelid; and the hairs will not scratch it.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the shape of the two canes which you will make according to this figure as regards length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Regarding lifting out stinging hairs from the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The procedure for this is to take a fine needle and put into it a thread of the thinnest silk and softest.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then bring together its ends and fasten each with a small knot; the length of these threads should be one palm's width.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then add beneath it another fine thread of short length and knot its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	The invalid should then place his head on your lap and be close to the sun so that the operation is revealed; because it is a subtle or minor operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with a thread into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you draw out from above a natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the hair up above the thread and introduce into the thread that hair, or if there are two or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it until the hair comes out with the thread from the eyelid along with a natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if the thread is drawn and not the hair with it, draw the thread downwards with the thread that you put on it until the thread comes out through the upper opening; look at it with your eyes: then pull both thread and hair and close the eye. Leave it closed for two or three days until the hair attaches to its place and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short then either attach a longer one of the natural hairs and raise it with that or leave it until it grows long and then pull it out.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the cure of an abscess that happens on the upper eyelid:
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When an abscess of this kind happens to the eye it is called a hare-lip.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	This type of abscess may be either congenital or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	The accidental kind comes about due to the healing of a wound or incision or burn or something similar.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operating is such that you split that consolidation and separate its lips, and place between them a lint dressing, then bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And you must not use things that dry out and constrict in its treatment; for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was before. Rather, use things that soften, such as fenugreek: and poultice with water in which althea has been cooked, flax seed: and diakoudion ointment, liquefied with one of the oils: and wrap with this lint, and treat with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your aim should be to try by every means that it does not consolidate again in the way it was at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation we have described is nothing other than a correction of the Alxatrati, so that it does not return to the shape of the place exactly as it was.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	§ On the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati which occurs below is what is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental type happens from a wound, or a tear, or a cauterisation, and things like them.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operating on it is to take a needle with double thread and dip it into flesh, and make it go through from left lacrimal to right lacrimal until the thread comes out at both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the flesh upwards with a needle, and cut it with a spatula that is half an inch wide.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, that is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a rod and place it in the crack, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two incisions be from the two corners of the incision until they meet and form an angle: so that when they are joined together this shape is made, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount which is its sharp edge below, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join the separated parts: or sew it together with woolen thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said about softening medicines, and with linen cloths until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if any aloes happen to fall out of the crack or stitches, or by cauterization: then you must make a flat incision underneath the eyelashes of the eyelid, also according as was done before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with linen cloth, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the treatment for aloes when it is above or below, is that the procedure should be carried out according to how the aloes are prepared.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it has many variations in form: and a prudent practitioner prepares their skill with whatever way is possible to them, until they restore the shape to its natural form, or near it; and themselves being infirm, according as suits them from the operation and instruments in most situations.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this adhesion happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes stuck to the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural movements.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	You should therefore insert the end of a spatula under the eyelid and lift it upwards; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, which is not sharp like surgical spatulas, but rather slightly blunt; so that the patient is not troubled during the operation, and the spatula does not move and injure the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you were scraping off that adhesion easily, until the eyelid returns to its natural shape, and the adhesion is completely healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salty water into the eye, wash it with water; or distill onto it from a sieve made for this purpose, from zinjar dissolved with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen cloth; and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after three days use a sieve and compresses until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the incision of the fingernail and the prominence of the fleshy part of the tear duct.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the fingernail is of two types.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous; and it is like hard but thin wood.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, like frozen white moisture; which when it touches cold iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, breaks off and the hook does not stick into it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	Both types do not begin unless from the greater tear duct, as it gradually advances until it covers vision, and obstructs light and eye movement.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the mode of operation for its incision is: that you place the patient's head on your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open their eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Next, gather the claw with a hook twice its size and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle and insert into it a hair from a horse, cow or goat; let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle slightly, then fasten it in the middle of the claw; penetrate with the needle and bind the claw with thread and extend it upwards; scrape with the hair the side of the claw that follows the pupil as if you were plucking it with a hair until its very end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula or small scissors; and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that there is no frequent flow of tears from its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the claw is extended with just a hook; or with thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it gently with a thin spatula of this shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware that the spatula does not touch the corneal layer, lest it tear, and the pupil be perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, throw into the eye some crushed salt or some made from saffron, and leave it there until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Treat him with what is necessary until he recovers.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the hoof is not damaged and you cannot insert a needle into it or hook [a lever] into it, then this kind of hoof injury should be treated with medicines many times over until it heals as I described in the division on the subject.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you want to cut it, then open the patient's eye and take a very thin, soft, blunt spatula of this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape off the top surface of the hoof with a chisel, carefully.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that the hoof is softening and cracking under pressure from the chisel then drip into the patient's eye every hour one of the following medicines which you have made yourself: zinja oil, red zief, or powdered salt; cover the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat this procedure on it until you have removed all of that.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is hot pus in the eye; then leave it alone and treat the inflammation until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat this procedure on it with the chisel until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	If the flesh of the tear duct is causing significant harm to the eye then suspend it with a hook and cut off some of its parts; do not make too deep an incision in case this interrupts the flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then drip into the tear duct red zief or oil until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	On cutting an alguardenic (swelling) and flesh growing over the eye...
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	There is sometimes born in certain human eyes a red fleshy growth, or one that lies over the eye, until it covers the pupil, approaches it, or presses against it above the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards; and it resembles a wild rose.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on this is also for the sick person to put his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open their eyes, and gather all that flesh with suitable hooks; and hold it with one forceps or hemostat.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until you have finished all of it with the scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And take care not to harm the eye during the operation; and let your cut be made with either a small knife, which we described in nail cutting, or with small scissors, like those used for hair-cutting, as will come up later in this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	So when your cut is complete and all the fleshy material has been removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or else distil into it red powder, and similar corrosive medicines; and place over the outside of the eye a poultice made from the white of an egg: so that it may be protected from hot pus.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	But if any of the fleshy material remains and hot blood flows from it, and you fear a hot abscess; then leave the eye alone, and treat it with whatever will calm the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then return to them with an operation until they are healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do likewise for any added flesh that happens to grow in the eye from this condition.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you treat any weak eye through natural means or by operating with iron; and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you have seen that the member can withstand this treatment.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On draining pus from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Pus is red veins that are formed over the eye, preventing its sight; and it weakens the eye with time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary that you first determine if the eye with pus is strong and free from other ailments; then drain its pus.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And you should advise the patient to put their head on your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then tie those veins with one hook or two depending on your judgement; and let the hooks be thin needles shaped like this, or they can be two-sided ones made of one body shaped like this.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	After that, remove those veins with a thin pair of scissors carefully; and wipe off the blood every hour until you see the veins are removed from the eye, and dissolved; and beware not to injure the eye with the edges of the needles.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your treatment be done at noon under the sun; and you should be very firm during the procedure lest you cut other veins besides those targeted ones.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you are done with the procedure, then drop into the eye green vinegar or red one so that its sharpness dissolves what remains of pus.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If you are unable to remove all of the pus in that hour; then cover the eye with a plaster that treats its pain and leave it for some days until its ache is settled; and keep this away from heat during these few days: later repeat the same procedure over and over again until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the shape of scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the repair of the nose by means of cartilage.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call this nose repair a fistula which is treated with the cautery or sharp medicine burning it, according to what precedes its narration.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal then there is no skill in it unless you cut open the abscess at its base and extract all the moisture which is in it as well as the pus until bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	So when bone is exposed and you see that it has been corrupted or turned black then scrape it with an instrument of this shape.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	This is called the rough head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of hardened iron and let its head be round like an awl which has been scored with the marks of a file or the scoring tool for fine lines, and apply it to that part of bone which is corrupted.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then rotate it between your fingers and press down a little with your hand until you know that the corruption has been scraped away and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with drying and binding medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	So if the place becomes firm and flesh grows back and there is no more discharge of pus or blood and it remains this way for forty days without any renewal of corruption or abscess formation nor any other event occurring, then you know that it has healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not then there is no skill to it except returning the fistula to the nostril according to this pattern.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And you should expose the second bone using a knife or sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill in this form, with an iron tip that is triangular; and its wood is tapered like a pyramid to the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it on the same bone; let it be near the lacrimal bone; and extend your hand slightly away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then rotate your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone and you feel it weaken; by this you will know that air is escaping from it when they hold their hand over their nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	So then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When flesh forms and the place hardens; then the matter that was discharged outwards returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter over the weak one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	§ On the reduction of an elevated eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with all of it and there is no harm nor reduction to vision; then you must relieve the weak one by bleeding it; afterwards place leeches on the neck without scarring but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then apply to the eye an ointment made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and storax.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye above with a plaster containing many chickpeas.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	The manner of the chickpeas is this; take soft cloths many in number, and fold each cloth four times over; make many of these; then place them one on top of another according to how much the eye needs; then bind them firmly with a strong hard cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	Repeat the cupping procedure with suction only, without making an incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the cups and leave the eye covered day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the sinew becomes slack again, it must be tightened further; then remove the bandage after a day and night, as I said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If you see that the eye has regained its shape and colour, that is good; but if not, then repeat the poultice, compresses, bandage and cupping until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On excision of the coloured tunic.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When an injury to the coloured tunic results in a disfigurement that protrudes beyond the eyelid like a grain of millet and mars the appearance of the face, so that you wish to operate on it, this is how it should be done according to what I will tell you: insert the needle at the root of the eyeball from below upwards.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another needle with doubled thread from the side towards the lacrimal sac and let it pierce through; leave the first needle in its place.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then make an incision at the place of the doubled thread and use it to tie off the affected part of the eyeball around the needle; tighten it firmly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then withdraw the needle and place over the eye wool soaked in white of egg; leave it there until the thread drops off with the coloured tunic.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with this remedy which soothes it until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the eyeball should be tightly bandaged all round with a cloth until the eye protrudes considerably.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it should be pierced with a thin spatula which reaches the depths of the eye, and the white moisture flows out, and the eye drops down, then insert it immediately; afterwards press it until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the cure for alcoholism.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease called alcoholism is nothing but a collection of filth in the eyes, like water pouring down, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the procedure for this is to make the patient sit on a chair that has been prepared or a straight-back chair.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take their head in both hands and move it until you see the filth reach below your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is tied up so that nothing leaks out and the sight is restored; and the patient sees things as they used to see them: and if none of this leaked below, you know that it was water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however the leaking of filth is not prepared as we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a thin spatula and use it on the tough skin for a bit near the junction of the conjunctiva with the white part until filth comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Once it comes out then pour into the eye warm water in which you mixed honey; or water in which you boiled fenugreek and honey; afterwards treat with the rest of the procedure until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On treating water leakage from the eye or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	I have mentioned the types of water already in my division, and what is suitable for puncturing when speaking declaratively and explaining it, then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Therefore, you should make the patient sit between your hands with a square in front of them, facing the light, close to the sun; and tie up their healthy eye, pulling it tightly shut; then, using your right hand, hold down the eyelid of their eye if it is the left one that has water in it; or use your left hand if it's their right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take some almagd in your right hand if it is the left eye; or in your left hand if it's their right eye.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Place the end of the almagd near the edge of the bone around the eye where the tear duct is visible; then push the almagd with force and turn your hand along with it until you feel that it has penetrated the white part of the eye, and sense that the almagd has now reached a hollow.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	The depth that the almagd needs to travel should be equal to the distance between the pupil and the edge of the iris; this is the eye's ring.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the pupil of the eye due to the brightness of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then push the almagd as far as the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Press the almagd itself downwards with one squeeze after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If water comes out immediately then the patient will instantly see what they are looking at and also see the almagd in their eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then you should rest for a short while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If water therefore drains away, then remove it again, except that almagd leaves.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it is therefore inserted, and does not rise: then extract the almagd with ease; and you rotate your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve some clear gemstone salt in water; and wash the eye with it within.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place over the eye a whole swab or lint infused with rose oil and white of egg; and bind it to the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We however, and those who are of our time, place on it powdered antimony with white of egg.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If almagd does not obey you and enter the eye due to its hardness, since the person's eye is very hard; then you must take a spatula which is called 'Alberid', of this form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Pierce therefore with it the conjunctiva only, and do not push your hand into the opening; and it is only necessary that you make a pathway to the eye for the almagd.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almagd as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient a decently-made bedroom in which they sleep on their back in a dark room; and prevent them from all movements and coughing; and give them food that soothes their nature; and do not let them move their head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	The ligament should remain in its original position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then you should undo it in that dark house and test his vision; make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then return the ligament to its position by the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	It is not necessary to do this during the treatment time or immediately after the incision; rather, it should be postponed because water quickly evaporates through intense heat.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	However, if a hot abscess occurs then you should open the eye before the seventh day and adjust it as the abscess subsides until it is calm; then restore his vision completely and place over his face an ocular to regulate his sight for some days while he remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should leave the house gradually and return to his own home.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	Also be aware that the student is not to be exempted from testing his vision several times; otherwise he will dare to perform the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now a certain one of them from Al-Ayraq has reached us who said that there was done in Al-Ayraq on a woman an operation where water is drained through a hole.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	So therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor did I read about it in any of the old books; and it is possible that it might be something new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the shapes of spectacles for those who do not know how to make them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	They should be made of pure brass; and their ends with this same triangular shape, and the sharp end.
Formae magda.	The shape is beautiful.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	For treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes different kinds of flesh grow in the nose, among which there is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from it comes cancerous flesh, stony, of a dark colour; and from this is what is soft flesh, not of a dark colour.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In that which is soft and not fraudulent of these flesh types, you should make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun, and open their nostrils, then cast hooks into those flesh parts; next draw them outwards, and cut what you have taken from them with a thin sharp spatula on one side until you know all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If any part remains which cannot be excised, then scrape it with one of the thin instruments gently until nothing of it is left behind.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if blood should master you or a hot abscess appear, then oppose it with that which is required; or this is of malignant abscesses, then quickly cauterise it until the blood has ceased and all flesh is gone.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Afterwards cast vinegar into the nose after cutting it, and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose should open up, and moisture proceeds from it as far as the palate, then you know that they are now healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that flesh has grown within on the upper nasal bones to which the instrument did not reach with its cutting.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	You should then introduce a linen thread of some thickness and make many knots on it; leave the size of a finger or less between each knot; and have the patient put one end of the thread in his nose with a needle or whatever is possible for him after making the string similar to an azer; pull until it comes out onto his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times boys do the same thing in school; it's an easy task for whoever wants to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then take the two ends of the thread: one end that comes out on top of the nose and another that remained inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then take the flesh clamp and attach it to the knots on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the meat is now attached to the thread's knots.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then remove the thread and put into the nose a linen cloth soaked with Egyptian ointment after washing away any blood; do this for three days or more until all that remains of the meat is dissolved by the ointment.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Finally put into the nose a leaden tube for some days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however he needs an astringent cure, use this one instead.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making the ointment container in which oils and other medicines are distilled for the nose, make it out of silver or bronze; this should be like a small lamp, open like a shell, with its passageway similar.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make the tube closed like a pipe.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	The small shell of the instrument is made for preparing the head dressing; it should be full and uncovered: at its end there is a handle by which you can hold it when heating oil or any juice or fluid in it.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the cure for nasal polyp.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Nasal polyp often occurs at the end of the nose; it grows bigger with time until its appearance becomes unsightly.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	For this reason, you should cut it off at the beginning of its appearance and remove all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then put on the spot either a caustic or a cauterizing medicine which stands in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If you delay the incision until it has grown bigger, then examine whether it is stony hard, of dark colour and insensitive to touch; in that case do not touch it with the knife for it is a cancerous ulcer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen someone who incises such an ulcer and a great deal of harm comes to the person having it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	But if the ulcer is soft to touch, not of dark colour and you see that it can be entirely cut out then evacuate the pus and incise without fear or hesitation; treat the spot with what dries and contracts until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On stitching up nose, lip and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Understand that when there is a break of continuity in any of these cartilages an operation on it rarely succeeds except with some persons.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something happens to someone from that, you must examine it; if it is a fresh wound with its blood: and then bring together the edges of the wound with stitches; then treat it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the solution of continuity has already separated the edges and each part is made healthy; then you must scrape all parts from its skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then bring together the two edges with stitches and tighten them; sprinkle over it powdered dragon's blood and crushed frankincense; place on top a piece of fine cloth plaster and another one from hardened plasters; leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then remove it and change the dressing; leave it until the threads fall off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of stitching is to bring together the solution of continuity either with needles as we described for stitching the abdomen; or by bringing together the edges with thread as I have made you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	§ On extracting lumps of lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people often have hard lumps similar to grass seeds inside their lips; some are smaller and others bigger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, you must turn the lip outwards and cut over each lump, then lift it with a hook and cut it from every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then pack the place after cutting with bruised egg white until the bleeding stops.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it should be cleaned with vinegar, and the place where there is a styptic quality should be treated with it until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On incising flesh born over the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many times flesh grows over the gum which the Ancients call an abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore you must hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root and let the pus or blood run out.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on the place some dried bruised zedoary or other styptic or drying powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If the flesh returns after healing as it often does then cut it a second time and cauterise it for it will not return after cauterisation.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the management of teeth with an iron tool.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes rough, nasty barks gather on the surfaces of teeth from their inner and outer parts and between the gums which sometimes become discoloured and turn yellow or green until decay sets in from them to the gum and the teeth become ugly because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	You should therefore have the patient sit between your hands and his head in your lap and shave off with a rasp both tooth and gum where you see barks and things that look like grit: until nothing of them remains and do likewise for blackness, greenness, yellowness and other things until they are clean.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore the cause is removed from them at the beginning that is good but if not then repeat the treatment on them another day and a second and third until you finally achieve what you want.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that the tooth requires razors of various forms and many shapes; according to how it is prepared for your operation; therefore, the razor with which the tooth is scraped from below is different than the one used between teeth, depending on other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of razors should be prepared for you as you see them.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You must treat the tooth's pain with all your skill and delay its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For its adjacent tooth cannot replace it when it is extracted because it is a superior substance; until there is no excuse for not extracting it, then when the patient is forced to extract it, they must do so firmly and ensure that you are certain about which painful tooth should be extracted.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Indeed the pain often deceives a patient, leading them to believe it is from a healthy tooth and causing its extraction; then the pain does not go away until their unhealthy tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have already seen this from the operations of bloodletting physicians.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Once you have identified the painful tooth yourself, you must make an incision around it with a small spatula, which should contain something medicinal, until the gum is loosened from all sides; then move the tooth with your fingers or fine forceps gradually at first, until you shake it loose.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps into a good spot in the tooth and hold its head between your knees; firmly grasp what you have held so well that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not exit, then take one of those instruments and insert it beneath from all sides with ease, and attempt to move it as you did initially.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	However, if the tooth is perforated or corroded, you must fill that hole with cloth and bind it tightly with a thin splint so that it does not break when you grip it with the forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And be sure to thoroughly scarify all around the gums extensively.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And maintain your strength so that you do not break it and leave part of it behind which could cause even greater pain than before.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware of doing what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste and boldness when extracting teeth other than the methods we have described here.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For many a time have they brought about severe injuries in people when they break teeth leaving the roots behind or some of them; or when extracting a tooth, they pull out part of the jawbone as well - something we have seen on multiple occasions.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	After extraction it should be rinsed with wine or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	Should any bleeding occur from the socket (which often happens), then take some egg yolk and fill it with that; if you do not have access to an egg yolk, cauterize it instead.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The fine forceps used to move the tooth initially should be long-handled with short shafts and robust. As you can see, those with thick handles do not bind themselves together when they are clamped shut. The tips should be short and made of hardened iron or uneven steel, straight, and with teeth that engage each other upon closure in a firm but appropriate grip.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes they form points like the shape of a bird's mouth called a stork, and are strong in compression.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth, and extraction of broken jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When anything remains after the removal of a broken tooth, then you should place on the site a poultice with butter for one or two days until the area softens; afterwards insert into it an algaze, or forceps: whose ends resemble the mouth of a bird called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This is the form of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their ends should be made like a rasp inside; or like the claws of an eagle.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If it therefore does not yield to you at the exit with these forceps, then you must hollow out over the root and expose all of the flesh, and insert a tool called a small lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Its end should be short but thick; and not too deep, so as not to break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If the root therefore comes out through it, that is good; and if not, you must assist with these other tools whose forms are as follows.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first is triangular-ended, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of this one has a thin triangle end.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also assisted with this instrument having two branches, whose form is as follows.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And also with other tools and instruments that have been mentioned previously regarding teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Even if there is an animal whose foot resembles a large hook, with this instrument of the following shape, with a triangular twisted end, where there is something thick so that it does not break; and let it be unsoaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you should know that there are many dental instruments; similarly, other instruments cannot be counted and a skilled craftsman, subtle in his art, devises an instrument for himself according to the operation required and the illnesses themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Since there are thicknesses for which the ancients did not say an instrument because of the variety of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the bone of the jaw or other bones of the mouth should break or decay: then probe it thoroughly at that place with what is suitable to him from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in extracting roots, and assist with a lever whose form is this one.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let it be somewhat thick at that place so that the bone is pulled and held with it, not sliding or slipping until the bone comes out; then treat the place with suitable medicines for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small amount of decay in the bone, then scrape it free from its decay and treat it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the extraction of prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth grow to prominence not according to their natural course, it is an ugly deformity; especially when it happens among women and girls, namely on the cheeks.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It must therefore be considered.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	If a tooth is born after another tooth and it does not get placed, or its enclosure is impossible, nor can it be filed: then remove the tooth; and if it adjoins another tooth, cut it with this instrument that has this form.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It resembles a small beak, and is made of hardened iron with a very sharp point.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And if the incision is long, as you cut it with this instrument on many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that none of the other teeth are moved.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however it is exposed above its level then file it down with an iron file of this form.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It is entirely made of iron and its handle has very small dots like the one that needles are filed with: with which the tooth can be gradually filed over many days without it being shaken out or falling out; then soothe it, and finally smoothen it with some scrapers.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If it is a tooth that breaks and injures the tongue then you must file it as well until the sharpness of its fracture is removed and it is even; and smoothen it so that it does not injure the tongue nor ruin speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On resetting teeth with gold wire.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth become loose due to a blow or an accident and the patient cannot bite on something so it does not fall out; and you have treated them with astringent medicines but that was of no avail: then they can be fastened with gold wire, as silver becomes green and rots after some days, while gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be average in fineness and thickness according to the quantity that can fit between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of this operation is such that you take a thread and insert twice its length between two healthy teeth; then weave it with both ends of the thread in the damaged teeth, whether there is one or more, until you reach the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving process until you reach where you started; and squeeze your hand with care and wisdom until it cannot be moved at all; and make sure that your tightening of the thread is around the roots of the teeth so that it does not come out.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the superfluous ends of the thread with scissors; and bring them together and turn them over with your finger; and hide these under the healthy tooth and the damaged one so that they do not harm the tongue; then leave it tied tightly until healed.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if it becomes untied or cut, tighten them with another thread, and it will stand thus for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the method for teeth; and so is the form of the operation for two healthy teeth and two damaged ones, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return after they have fallen out and are retained as we described; but this can only be done by a wise and experienced practitioner.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes some bone from the jaw is adapted; and it becomes like a tooth form and is placed where the tooth was anchored and tightened as we said; and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	The incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the procedure is to open the patient's mouth with your hand and raise their tongue; then cut through that sinewy ligament lengthwise until it releases the tongue from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is any hardness and knotting within it, and if this is due to a healed wound: then thrust a hook into it and move the hook lengthwise until you cut through the ligament and release the knot.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And take care that there is no deep laceration in the flesh, lest you cut the artery there and cause bleeding.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then let it be washed in the track of the incision with rosewater, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a linen dressing, which the patient should wear every night; so that it does not heal over again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if bleeding occurs, then put bruised egg on the spot.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the bleeding overcomes you, then cauterize the spot with a fig-wood cautery suitable for it; afterwards treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	The removal of a ranula that forms under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes there occurs under the tongue a swelling that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function; and perhaps it grows so large as to fill the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth in front of the sun; then examine the swelling.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If you see it is of dark or black colour, hard, and the patient feels no pain; then do not touch it, for it is a cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it has an incline towards whiteness, where there is moisture, then thrust a hook into it; cut it out with a very sharp knife and remove all of it.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If bleeding defies you during your operation, then place over it bruised figwort until the blood ceases; then resume your operation until you have removed it along with its root.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Afterwards, it should be cleaned with vinegar and salt; then treat it with the appropriate remaining cure until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the treatment of swelling of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat and chin, that is to say, at the glands which resemble a cotton wool pad and are found outside; these are called the two tonsils: when you treat them as we have said earlier in this chapter, but they do not heal; then consider them carefully.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If it is a hard swelling of dark colour with little sensation; then do not touch it with an iron instrument.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red colour and its root is thick; then do not touch it with an iron instrument for fear of blood loss, rather leave it until it ripens.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it yourself; or it will break by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in colour, round, and its root is fine; then it must be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And when operating on it, consider beforehand whether its abscess has quietened fully while remaining hot, or diminishes to some extent; then make the patient sit in front of the sun, with his head in your lap: and open his mouth, and have a servant take this instrument (of such-and-such form) between their hands, pressing his tongue downwards.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver or brass, thin like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you therefore press it against his tongue with the instrument and the abscess is revealed to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook and fix it into the tonsil, extracting as much of it outwards as you can without tearing anything from the clothing.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument of this form that follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is like a pair of scissors; however its tips are curved so that the aperture of each faces directly one another and is sharp: take care to have it made from iron or bronze well-soaked (in something).
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	But if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatoula of this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let one side be sharp, the other not.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And when you have cut one tonsil, cut the other in like manner.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If he has a nosebleed, have him gargle with water in which the bark of pomegranates has been boiled or myrtle leaves and similar astringents until the bleeding stops; then treat the wound until it is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other abscesses form in the throat besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Make an incision accordingly, as I described for the incision of two tonsils, equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself have treated a woman for an abscess that had developed between her throat and the area in front of the neck which was causing breathing difficulties, loss of sensation, and almost complete closure of the throat; she could only breathe through a small opening, and was unable to eat or drink water. She had reached the point of death if left untreated for one or two more days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	The abscess had grown so much that it sent out two branches until they emerged at the outer openings of both nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I hastened to prepare accordingly and inserted one hook into each.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, extracting most of the pus.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut her nostrils where they were joined together.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	I then treated the area around the other nostril in the same way.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	I then opened her mouth and pressed down on her tongue; after that I inserted a hook into the abscess, cut away part of it, and very little blood flowed from this area. The woman's throat was now healed, and she began to drink water immediately, followed by solid food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I therefore did not cease to cut out that abscess many times over a long period; and an abscess would form in the place of the one I had cut out until it became too extensive along with the other one.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore devised an idea and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	I therefore stood back from it; then I walked away on one side and did not know what God had done with him after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the cutting out of an abscess on the lip.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When pus descends to the lip and an abscess forms on it that is long, then itself it is called "perpendicular"; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then itself it is called a "ball".
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we have said above in division, and treatment does not take effect; and you see that the abscess has become quiet of its heat, and it has thinned out; then it is necessary to cut into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And if there is a round lump attached to it, and it has no length of its own; and it is bloody in appearance or the colour of pitch or black, and it lacks sensation; then you should direct your cut towards it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For there is fear in this for the patient.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore when you see it according to the way I have described from its whiteness and length, then you should make the patient sit facing the sun; and press his tongue down with an instrument as previously described; then fix a hook into the lip, and draw it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned for cutting out two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	You must not cut away any part unless it is that which lies beyond the normal limit without extension.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	If you cut more of it away, you will impair the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use what we described for the incision of two tonsils: and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the patient is frightened by the incision: then you must use your skill to cauterize it without fear and trepidation.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	The way to cauterize it is not with boiling water: rather you must place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press their tongue with the instrument which we described.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take some of the water which I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing and mix it with unslaked lime, making a paste neither thick nor thin, and fill this hollow instrument with it, which is shaped thus.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	The end of the instrument that holds the medicine should be hollow like the scooped-out end of a spoon.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	Place the instrument with its medicine on their throat itself: and have them lie on their side so that saliva from their mouth runs towards it from inside, without anything of it flowing down into their throat to harm them.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine over it.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And hold it over their throat for half an hour at first until you see its blackening and the ceasing of the medicine's biting sensation.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take cotton and roll it over the rounded end of a stick, then dip the cotton in its medicine and insert this stick with the cotton into the pipe until the cotton adheres against their throat.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do it repeatedly until you achieve what you want regarding cauterization of veins.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it; for in itself it dries up and falls off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it; and after cauterization clean around the vein with a cotton pad soaked in butter, and purify [the wound] with what is left of the medicine; and let it be dressed with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And dress [the wound] externally with compresses, and internally with mouthwashes until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore this kind of cure is healthier than cutting, and more distant from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes a wound is healed even with something finer than cauterization and cutting; it is in fact cured with fumigation like this.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take galangal, hyssop, oregano, rue, seseli, chamomile, southernwood and similar herbs to them; and put all of them or some of them in a pot, submerge with vinegar and boil; and the pot should be sealed with decent clay; and there is an opening at its middle over which this hollow instrument is fitted.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	It should be made of silver or brass; and the end that has a pomegranate on it is introduced into the mouth of the sick person until steam rises up to the wound through the tube until the wound darkens considerably.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it multiple times, until it dries.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And take care not to do this cure at the beginning of an abscess's appearance.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For he often adds to the abscess: and it is not necessary that you do so unless at the decline of its warmth.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if you do not have this instrument present, then take a reed and cover its end with sheep's skin so that the patient's mouth is not burned; for the sheep's skin prevents the vapor from burning the bone; and this is good cure with healing.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often there sticks in the throat a bone or fish spine or some other thing.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	You should therefore extract what is visible of it from that which falls to the eye after you have pressed down the tongue with an instrument towards the sun and make clear to yourself what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what is not visible to you but hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before it is digested by the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	For perhaps what was stuck will come out with the vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root; or let them swallow a dry bread pellet, or take a piece of dried soft sea sponge and tie it in a string before swallowing.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When these reach the place where the spines or bone is then it will be pulled out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not come out with what we have said, then use a lead instrument of this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a spoke by some measure and at its end let there be a curve which you insert into their throat with ease; and the patient should have their head elevated upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And warn him to avoid touching his epiglottis, lest he get a cough, and push with it a bone or thorn, or insert it the physician by hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But if the patient should insert it himself, this is better; because of his knowledge of the place where the object is located: and he should push downwards or pull up his hand with the instrument, all according to the amount prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	§ On the Extraction of Leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is treated with what I said earlier in the section on treatment with medications and it does not work, then look at the patient's throat in front of the sun or near the sun after you press their tongue with the instrument I described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If your gaze falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook or with thin tweezers appropriately.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	But if it is not possible with these: then take a hollow tube, and insert it into the patient's throat close to their gullet; next, insert into the hollow of the tube a heated iron rod.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times; and let the patient refrain from drinking water for that whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a vessel full of cold water and open his mouth into it; and rinse his mouth with it, but do not swallow any of it; and move the water around every hour for another.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately falls when it senses the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If however it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with flea powder or with asa as with the instrument I described for fumigating a boil.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that several times, since it will fall out.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which are living plums with fire: and let the pot be covered with a lid, on whose middle is a hole: and let the end of the instrument be fitted into it.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the fumigation, and let the patient put their mouth on the end of the tube, and close their mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately fall off.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall then repeat fumigation several times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the patient endure thirst, eat salts, garlic, onions, but not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is therefore necessary that it come out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which you extract the leech from the throat when it falls on it's back.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps as you see: except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, on which is a roughness like a file: when it grasps anything, it does not let go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of abscesses, their incision, and treatment in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many types of abscesses, and they occur in numerous ways; I will here mention only one, which is dealt with in this book; there are different methods for opening them, and they are cut open in two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is an abscess that forms within itself, due to its own humors.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is because of the places where it occurs on the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Since an abscess on the head is different from one that occurs at the anus; and also an abscess in fleshy areas differs from one occurring over joints; each of these has its own specific treatment method.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	Among abscesses are those which should not be opened unless after the pus inside them has matured and reached completion; while others need to be cut open when still raw, before their contents have fully developed.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as abscesses that occur near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because when an abscess happens close to a joint and extends itself further until what's inside it putrefies; the surrounding ligaments or nerves of that joint may be affected too - which is the cause for that limb to contract more easily.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it's an abscess near a limb; for if you delay opening it until it matures, this will harm either the limb itself or the main body part attached to it.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it's close to the anus - then you must open it when still immature; and do not open an abscess that is raw or incomplete, unless it's near the anus so as not to let what's inside it putrefy deep down reaching the interior of the anus, forming a fistula there, which does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You should know the time of the abscess's perforation, which has matured according to its fullness; and it is at the point of pain relief, fever reduction, redness, pulsation, and sharpness of the head of the abscess: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And you must make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess, and where the swelling is more prominent; and let the incision go along the length of the body, if the abscesses are in parts of hands and feet, and places of arms, ribs, nerves, arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no curvature.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those which curve, go with the incision according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When however the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better that you leave its incision until its digestion hardens, as we said according to fullness.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you make an incision in it beforehand, the course of its pus is prolonged, and there is much dirt and foulness, and perhaps its lips will harden, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are incised across the width of the body when necessary; or according to that which the limb requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And you must make a small incision in the smaller abscesses, and a large one in the larger abscesses; or multiple incisions according to the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are some abscesses where the skin must be scooped out; and it should be incised when it has already become like cloth, and reached its limit, which is now dead; as happens with many swellings, double ones, and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And among them are those that are cut with a three-cornered incision.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And one of these is cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among them are those where a round incision or crescent-shaped one is administered; incisions similar to these.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	But that which has no head, like soft surface abscesses, should be pierced with a shallow or flat probe only.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when an abscess is large and has already gathered a lot of pus, and you pierce it, do not rush to extract all the pus at that moment; rather, draw out just some of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then cover the abscess until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some more of the pus.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times in stages, until it discharges; especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old and feeble person: for often the vital spirit of one animal is weakened with that of another when pus escapes; and perhaps your patient will die, though you are unaware.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore take great care in this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have pierced these abscesses with this probe, it is necessary that you clean the wound; take note.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the abscess wound is small or the incision flat, then apply a lint dressing of linen, or an old cotton one.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	If there is a large abscess and many perforations are present, you must then insert a licinia into each fissure until they meet one another.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut away a portion of the skin in the abscess or have hollowed it out around its circumference, then you must fill it with old cotton, or as when one dresses a wound with cloth, or scrape linen wool without moisture and press it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it, and treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If there is a flow of blood during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar after a cloth has been soaked in them; place it over the bleeding area several times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If the bleeding persists, you must apply a regimen of treatment and powders that I have described in many places throughout this book and its sections.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is wintertime and the site of the abscess involves many nerves, then you must pour warm poultices mixed with wine and oil onto those areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is summertime and the areas are fleshy, then you must apply poultices soaked in water and oil or with wine and oil, keeping everything cool.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as I have said, you must then remove the abscess, clean it, and apply appropriate treatment until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	Thus ends the general knowledge of abscess treatment.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the path of division, I have now spoken about every type of abscess; how one should treat each in a summary fashion.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	On the draining of abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Abscesses occur on the skin of the head that are small and are similar to the species wens which are contained by sacks (tunics), like chicken pox itself.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many types of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some are fatty; some contain moisture like mud; and others hold moisture resembling curds and whey; and there are those similar to them; and there are hard stony ones among them.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And when draining all of them and extracting them there is no fear so long as during their drainage the artery does not offer resistance.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the procedure in draining them is that you should try it out with an instrument whose form comes after this, which is called "Intromissum", until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it holds moisture then dry it with a shallow incision lengthwise like this shape.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin the incision from the line b to the line g. So when it is drained of moisture then scrape out the cyst which contains that moisture and do not leave anything behind in it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For often it returns if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the cloth in Egyptian ointment if it is available; and if not then in water and salt; and fill with that your wound and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For the cloth will eat away what remained from the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the procedure with the second and third Egyptian [bandages], and if you need it, do so until you are confident that there is nothing left of the cyst; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a fatty nodule, then cut it open like so, with an incision shaped as a cross, and insert hooks between the lips of the incision; scrape out its contents from all sides: and attempt to remove the capsule that contained it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If an artery gives you trouble, then do what I shall describe to you next.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do likewise for an abscess that is stony hard, by making the same kind of incision and treatment as we have described.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the operation on a stony-hard abscess is easier because there is less blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are abscesses of this sort on the head which contain no moisture whatsoever.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is to say that I once operated on an abscess in the head of a very old woman and found it as hard and solid as stone; rough and white; which could not be broken or crushed with a blow.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other kinds of abscesses occurring on the head however (apart from those that occur on children's heads and at the roots of their ears), all such incisions should be made on a superficial plane.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make an opening at the lowest point of such swellings so as to allow the purulent discharge to drain downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat them with whatever is appropriate for their treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	The removal of goiters from the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses occur frequently on the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin area; sometimes they also appear elsewhere on the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And those that occur on the neck may be singular or multiple; they develop from each other and every goiter among them is contained within its own membrane as with lumps and abscesses of the head, as we have described.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	There are many types of goiters.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	Indeed, some of these goiters contain stones; others contain fluids; still others are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	For any goiter of good prognosis that you encounter—one which is close to the color of the skin, moves freely on all sides, and is not attached to the neck muscles or veins—you should remove it by making a shallow cut from top to bottom following the lines b-g; then scrape away the skin all around and stretch out the two edges with a hook or several hooks if necessary as we described for head abscesses, and gradually extract it.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And one must take care not to cut any veins or nerves.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	The knife should not be too sharp; in this way you won't hurt your hand during the operation or upset the patient and make an unnecessary cut.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you cut a vein or artery and it prevents you from continuing the operation, then place on the wound some ground-up fig or blood-clotting powders; bind up the wound tightly, and leave the patient to rest until the swelling has gone down and the injury softens; or it may begin to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is cut off by the tincle. Return therefore to your operation until you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then check with your index finger if anything remains of the small strophulus; then cut them out and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if there is a large vein in the root of the strophulus, then you must not cut out that strophulus from its root; rather, it is necessary to tie it with double strong thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without causing harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cotton, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then treat it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire strophulus is cut off, then you must bring together the two lips of the wound and join them immediately after seeing that there remains no excess whatsoever.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there is an excess left due to the size of the strophulus, then it is necessary to pay attention to cutting its root and pulling it out; and apply the suture we described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And as for those strophulus that contain moisture, make a shallow hole in them so that the place of its ripening appears to you; and put the hole below what follows from the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then apply dressings with ointment and similar substances after the hole to eat away what remains of the corruption until you see that the wound is now cleansed; then treat it with an ointment for generating flesh until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the cutting of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring inside the throat:
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients called this incision 'in the epiglottis', and I have not seen anyone in our land perform it; these are the words of their writings.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	For those with synanche, the incision in the epiglottis should be avoided; it is not beneficial due to the weakness of all the veins and the lung.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those with a hot abscess in the mouth or throat, or on both tonsils when there is no illness in the trachea, an incision of the epiglottis should be made to avoid destruction caused by choking.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to make such an incision, it should be made under the three or four circles of the epiglottis with a small transverse cut between two circles; this should be an incision in the siphon and not the cartilage: this is indeed the suitable place for the incision as there is no meat on it, and the blood vessels are far away.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, they should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	They should then make an incision in the skin until they reach the trachea; avoiding any blood vessels that may be seen.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	After making the incision in the siphon as described, an indication that the trachea has been properly cut is when phlegm emerges from it, along with what was inside and a loss of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	Leave the wound open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When the hour of danger from choking has passed, bring together the two lips of the skin wound and sew them solely without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis says so.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The full explanation of this discussion which we have related is not evident until they see that one of these abscesses has already choked the patient's throat; and the patient is lifted up towards death, and wishes to be cut in order to ease his breathing: they go on to cut open the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe over the wound in a certain way, and he will be saved from death. And for this reason, they have recommended leaving the wound open until the illness has run its course - and this takes about three days or thereabouts; then therefore they recommend closing up the wound and curing it until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I myself have witnessed is that one woman took a knife and put it into her throat, and cut with it a part of the trachea.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to treat her, and I found that she was moaning like the moan of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	So I removed the knife from the wound, and found that there was only a small amount of blood coming out of the wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore I was confused because she had not cut the vein nor the windpipe, and air was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore treated the wound and cured it until it was healthy; nothing happened to the woman apart from a hoarseness of voice, and she returned home after a few days having improved her condition.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Thus I say that there is no need to fear cutting open the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the removal of a hernia in the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter Forty-Four
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess named hernia of the throat is a large one, resembling the colour of flesh, and it occurs frequently among women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is in two forms: either natural or accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly, the natural one does not arise from any inherent tendency.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental kind has two types, one of which resembles fatty swellings.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other type is like an abscess that forms from arterial pulsations.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is a risk involved; and it must not be presumed that an iron instrument should be applied to it unless the hernia is small. You must test it, and investigate it with your fingers.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	So if you find it resembles a fatty swelling and no vein is attached to it, then cut into it as swellings are excised; and extract what surrounds the hernia from the sac, if there is one, or else explore the entire area.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound with whatever is needed for healing until it is cured.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On excising swellings resembling fatty masses.
Caput XLV.	Chapter Forty-Five
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many types of swellings; and I have already described all their varieties earlier on. Now it is necessary to explain the distinction between a swelling and an exitura, as this causes uncertainty.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say, therefore, that when there is a departure of warmth and fever, and violent pains until the boiling of superfluities subsides, and putrefaction is complete; then indeed fevers and heat are quieted.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When there is no warmth nor fever or pain and they contain them with a wound dressing, which is their own sack, and it matches the colour of the body; and its beginning is like chickpeas, and it becomes like batecha, and larger and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two types; either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colours of the moisture are many, as I said in my classification.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	You should therefore, when you come to the treatment of a nodule, test it first and examine it with an instrument called an intromittere as described in the chapter that follows.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	The method of examining boils and all nodules is to take this instrument and insert it into the moistest place you find within the boil; and turn your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then extend your hand according to the measure of the size of the boil.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the intromittere and observe what comes out on its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore moisture comes out flowing whatever its colour: then dry it with a shallow incision as I said for other boils.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not come out on the track of the intromittere then know that it is fatty; therefore make an incision in the shape of a cross over it as I taught you: and hang it with hooks and scrape off the skin all around easily: and keep the dressing, if you can, so that you remove the whole thing healthy along with the nodule.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If, however, the cyst is ruptured during surgery and it is not possible to remove it whole, as this often happens, then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	If even a little bit is left behind, whether small or large, the lump returns for the most part.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if it overpowers you and a small amount remains: then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders at the end of your procedure; bind up the wound, and place on it what sits on a warm poultice, and treat it with the rest of the cure until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore there is a large lump, then seize its two lips, and treat it with that which promotes flesh growth.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if a pulsating or non-pulsating vein opposes you, then hurry and fill the place with crushed egg, and leave it bound for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the blood boil ceases; then return to cut off what remains of the lump.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Regarding instruments from outside for cutting and piercing...
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From these are the shapes of Introductors, and they are of three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For from them there is large, and from them there is medium, and from them there is small.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	They shall be made of iron fulcrums with square off-centre ends so that they hurry entry into the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the shapes of Probes, that is, piercers: and one of them is called a borer; and they are of three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	There are large ones, medium ones, and small ones among them.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They agree to investigate those abscesses, discharge, fistulas, and swellings due to what is between them of the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and soft like large needles with which saddles are stuffed, namely, of leather or bronze, iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best among them are those made of leather.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	Experience is also gained from black lead, which they agree to use to test fistulas with concave reflections so that they can be reflected gently along with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three types.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because among them there are long ones, medium ones, and short ones, according to the size of the fistula's width and constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of swabs, and there are many types.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because among them there are simple ones, that is, those with one curve; and they are of three types as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And among them there are blind swabs; and they are of three types.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And among them there are hooks with two curves and they are of three types; and among them there are hooks with three curves and they are also of three types; and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	These are the forms of scalpels with which nodules and abscesses are cut and scraped; and they are of three types: for among them there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities, which are cut, are sharp, the other extremities are not sharp; and they are not placed like this unless with them a benefit is done to lessen the scarring of nodules through fear of incision into a vein or nerve: and so that the patient might be cured, and find some relief from the burning rather than finding it in the excoriation of an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	I am Magda, and I am of three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of brass, and they look like a radio, with which alcohol is made; and at the broad end is hidden a pointed instrument called a Spatula Millimetre: and in it runs to the inside and outside when you want, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of the spatula millimetres that are hidden between fingers at the abscess piercing; and they go unnoticed by patients; and there are three kinds, large, medium, small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The shapes of the windbags with which the flow of blood is cut; and they are three types, large, medium, small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made of brass or quartz, round, slightly long as you see; and let them be thin.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And you must have these types of windbags large and small with you; so that you may cut blood swiftly in need, then when medicine is not available to you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	But you should not use them to cut blood in every place of the body; and only use them on fleshy areas such as the calf leg, hip, arm forearm, breast nipple, stomach, groin, and similar fleshy moist parts.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes small instruments are made from them similar to pistachio shells, according to their form; with which blood is cut off when it flows out of a place where venesection has been done, or at the incision of a vein or artery; and sometimes they are made round in this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the treatment of human teats that resemble women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the teats of some men swell up at the end of sleep (that is, when they begin to pollute in their sleep) until they resemble women's breasts: and they remain unsightly and disfigured.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever is disgusted by this should cut above the teats with a lunar incision, according to this form: from line b to line g. Then scrape off all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards fill the wound with incarnatio medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the teat droops downwards and softens because of its size, as happens with women: then it should be slit on its two upper sides by two similar lunar-shaped incisions, each of which is contained with the other at the end of either side, so that a larger containing line encloses a smaller enclosed one, according to this form: from line b to line g. Afterwards scrape off the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	But if you do not complete the incision because of the patient's unease or due to a flow of blood: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with subcutaneous cautery and leave it until it has burnt away all the remaining fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Treat him until he is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the perforation of an abscess which occurs under the armpit.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which occur under the armpit are of a hard type with cysts and some have fluids inside them.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those abscesses with fluids must be opened by making a crescent shaped incision from line b to g according to this pattern. When all the pus has been drained from it, fill the wound with old oil and leave until the next day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the old oil and dress with an appropriate ointment until healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the type with hard lumps then make an incision on top as we mentioned before for the treatment of boils.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If the wound extends so that it discharges pus then apply a hot iron to it as we mentioned before.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the opening of an abscess which occurs next to a large artery or vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery bursts and the skin above it heals over then this frequently causes abscesses to form; likewise when a vein is injured an abscess and swelling may occur there too.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	The signs by which you can know that the abscess and swelling are next to a large artery or vein are as follows: if it is an abscess caused by an injured artery then it will be long, deep within the body; also when you press your fingers against such an abscess you feel a kind of hissing sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And what lies near the Vein is rounded on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And an incision above this abscess is a mistake, especially if it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and other parts of the body; and it is extremely dangerous.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	It is therefore necessary to avoid treating it with an iron instrument, and what comes out from them must also be avoided, even if they are on the extremities or head.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	For that which comes out from them as a result of an arterial hole becoming swollen, you should make an incision in the skin lengthwise.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, afterwards the artery; and free it from its coverings until it is fully exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Next, introduce a needle under it and make the needle penetrate to the other side; then tie the artery with double thread at two places, as I have instructed you when removing two arteries from the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then lance the place between the two ligaments with a scalpel until all of the blood that is in it comes out and the abscess is drained.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply medication that promotes suppuration until the ligaments fall off; afterwards treat it with suitable ointments until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If the abscess is due to an incision into a vein, then you must hold as much of it with your hand as possible along with some skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Next introduce the needle under the place that you are holding with your hand and make it penetrate; have double thread on it so that when you withdraw it from the other side, the thread remains.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind it with a good ligament to the abscess; as I told you for binding a wound, on both sides with two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	However, if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread underneath the abscess along the entire length of the needle's insertion; push and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in its middle until whatever is inside comes out; then cut away the excess skin and leave what has been bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on it a poultice that you have soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment which is done with linen cloths and ointments until it is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	On an abscess caused by nerve torsion.
Caput L.	Chapter 5.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in arteries and veins, similarly an abscess occurs in nerves; which happens to them is due to impact or excessive exertion, and the like; and it most often occurs in them at places of ligaments, or the heel bone, and in any place where joints move; and this abscess is serious.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its colour is similar to the rest of the body, and it has multiple manifestations without pain; and when it is pressed vigorously, he feels in it a weakness like numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an abscess that accumulates deep within the body; rather, it is under the skin and moves to every side; and does not extend forward towards the front or backward toward the back.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore what occurs to them in joints should not be invaded with iron (surgery).
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps contraction may occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	Remove the skin from those on the head or face with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then lift it with a hook and scrape it; then remove it, and join the wound with stitches; and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the removal of an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some people often have swellings in their abdomens and other parts of their bodies that are called "Fungalia", due to their resemblance to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	The root of which is thin, its head is large, and its lips are turned inward.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there is one that is small among them; and there is one that grows to an extraordinary size.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I myself have seen a man with two such swellings in his abdomen, which were more like mushrooms than other things: there was no difference between them, for they had thin roots, their lips turned inward, and they oozed moisture constantly.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	So I cut them out and found that one weighed about 10 ounces, while the other was about 6. The procedure for cutting these out is to consider first whether the patient is moist-complexioned and the color of the swelling is white and its root thin; then cut it with a broad spatula and have cauteries ready in the fire nearby.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled when it is cut; therefore hasten if the blood defeats you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see him weak, fearful and afraid of the incision with the iron, then take a lead wire properly made, and tighten it with an athirl whose mode is as we said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the lead tightening.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not stop tightening the lead every time it presses on the wound until it is cut off and falls by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the wound is of a large root, then there is something to fear and be afraid of in its cutting; especially that which is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However it's possible to cut half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it so that it doesn't return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware lest you presume to cut a wound that is dark in colour, with little feeling and of ugly appearance; for it is indeed a cancerous abscess: and I shall come with a reminder about cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	§ On the treatment of an umbilical hernia.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	An umbilical hernia is formed from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from a hernia sac or intestine protruding through a tear above the belly, as happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	The wound should be closed either with the blood flowing from the vein or with that from the artery, according to what has been stated before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or by compression of the windiness within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	But if it is due to a crack in the shaft and there is an exit for pus: then it has an abscess-like appearance similar to the colour of the body; and it is soft, painless: and the location appears diverse.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the egress of the intestine, then its location is, as we have described, of a more violent diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and there may be a sound with it; and it increases greatly on entering the bath and with violent effort.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	But if it is due to moisture, it is soft; then when you press it with your hand, it is not hidden nor constricted and nothing is added to it.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If it is due to blood, then an abscess appears with these signs towards blackness of the skin.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is due to newly formed flesh, then the abscess is serious, large, hard and swells according to one quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is due to windiness, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the treatment of it is, as you should then consider, if the navel's prominence is due to arterial or venous blood or windiness; then you ought to be restrained from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and dread in it, as I taught you in the chapter where I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the swelling of the abdomen is due to a bowel or belly obstruction, then you should advise the patient to hold their breath and stand up straight.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark around the circumference of the abdomen with encaustic (hot wax).
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Next instruct him to lie face up between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a broad spatula around the abdomen, on the place that you marked with wax.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Next extend the center of the abscess upwards, using a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him tightly around the circumference with a strong thread or cord made of durable silk, and make sure to tie it off securely.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Next open up the extended center of the abscess above the binding.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you find that it has already been caught by the binding, then remove the binding and insert your index finger into it, pushing the bowel towards the interior of the abdomen; and if you find an obstruction, take it with the hook and cut away its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however you encounter an artery or vein that opposes you, then bind it tightly several times around.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your procedure.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	Take two needles and thread them with two strong threads; insert the two needles into the circumference that you made around the abscess, in the form of a cross, making sure to pierce through.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Tighten the abscess at four places on top of the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, leaving space until the swollen flesh rots away by itself; or cut it off when it is softened by putrefaction.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with whatever ointment is necessary until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If there is an umbilical hernia made of flesh or fluid, it must be treated with a concave poultice as we have explained.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood or fluid that you find inside it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with whatever hardens the area.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	On treating cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken about the types of cancer and how to treat them with medicines, as well as what precautions must be taken during treatment so it doesn't turn into an ulcer, and we've also mentioned that some cancers form in the womb and we spoke about their respective treatments too.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	The ancients have said that sometimes cancer is found at a place where it can be eradicated entirely - like breast or thigh cancers and their likes among the limbs, especially if they are small in size when found.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it is large and has become old, one should not get close to it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	I have never been able to heal anyone of it, nor did I see someone before me who managed to do so.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	When it is located as we have described above, the treatment must be such that you precede and treat the patient for black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then bleed them if they have an obvious fullness of blood.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient for treatment with whatever preparation is necessary.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw in hooks for crabs that suit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards hollow out the whole thing from all sides with a knife according to your inspection until nothing of its roots remain: and let blood run and don't cut it quickly but squeeze the places and wipe thick blood with your hand or whatever is possible there among instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if a flow of thick blood opposes you from an incision of the artery or vein then cauterise the vein until blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	§ On the treatment of dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already spoken about the classification of dropsy types and how water gathers; and signs of every type as well as treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron is only ascites type; and it does not come close to tympanic type or hyposarcous type at all for the latter is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this tympanic type of dropsy with medicines and it did not yield to your treatment then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient is already weak or has another illness besides dropsy such as a cough or diarrhoea then beware of treating them with iron since it is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a patient with exuberant strength and no illness besides dropsy alone nor is he young or old then the method of treatment in him is that you lift up the patient standing between your hands while an assistant behind him presses his belly with their hand pushing water to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a sharp spine, in this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It is of two acute parts, long, with a sharp end like the spine.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, it should have some gradual shortness to it, so that you do not penetrate with it during the operation all the way into the intestine and injure it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider this.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a swelling of the hydropsy caused by obstruction from within the intestines, then you should extend your cut three finger-widths below the navel to its lower end straight above the pubic bone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the hydropsy is caused by disease of the liver, then make your cut to its left three finger-widths from the navel.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the swelling is caused by disease of the spleen, then make your cut on his right side; and do not also make a cut over the side he wishes to lie upon, so that superfluities may not run into this weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce through with your instrument the whole skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce your hand into the incision and raise it with the spine between the skin and subcutaneous layer as if you were scraping it; and let what is scraped off be about the quantity of a fingernail or thereabouts.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then scrape until you come to the spine-like structure at the place of emptiness; and this is where water collects.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it and introduce into the hole an instrument of this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	It is like a small pipe; it is made of silver or brass or gold alloy, smooth and clean; at its lower end there is a small hole, while on its sides are three holes, two on one side and one on the other; and its tip is cut obliquely, as you see; at its upper end is fixed an armlet.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument reaches the water, it immediately descends onto the instrument; therefore, remove from the water within a medium amount of time.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	If you remove [the patient] from it more than is appropriate, then perhaps the sick person dies within the hour due to a resolute animal spirit; or there occurs syncope which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But remove [the patient] from it according to the amount of their strength, and according to what the sick person's dispositions indicate to you regarding the strength of their pulse, and their well-being.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then extract the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it is immediately retained by the skin which retains the hole that is on the sifac; of which I narrated, so that you may perforate it in that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then reinsert the instrument on the second day, if you see that the sick person can tolerate it; also extract a small amount from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself against error; until nothing remains of the water except a small amount.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the sick person, and let out a great deal of water; then treat it with burial in warm sand, and profuse sweating in bath and sun, and look out for thirst; and treat it with drying medicines until they are cured: and cauterize over stomach, liver, and spleen after extraction of water, as I narrated earlier.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the treatment of infants who are born with their urinary passages unperforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When a child emerges from their mother's womb and their lambdoid suture is not fully formed or has an abnormal opening, or is located in the wrong place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	We must therefore assist with its perforation immediately at birth using a very thin spatula, following this shape.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a thin lead peg into the hole and tie it off; keep it there for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When they want to urinate again, remove the peg and let them do so.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then put it back in afterwards.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place the lead there already, it is possible that as urine passes over this area, it will prevent its closure.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But in the case of one whose opening is narrow, it should be treated with lead, as we have said, for many days until it widens.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those whose opening is misplaced will suffer harm.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	This is because in those who are born like this, the opening is at the end of the shaft of their penis; therefore they cannot urinate forwards until they lift the shaft with their hand towards their body.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is it possible for them to have children as a result, since semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line; and this is an extremely distressing condition.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of surgery for it is that the patient should lie on their back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then stretch the head of their penis with your left hand using a lot of force, and cut through the head of its glans from the side of the frenulum either with a lancet or a sharp spatula: like when you slit a reed, or as if you were cutting something radish-shaped so that its middle looks similar to the head of the penis; and so that the opening falls in the centre where it should.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And take care during your procedure to avoid blood loss.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens that way.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore apply to him the same procedure as for cutting off blood flow, and treat the wound until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	On the complications which occur in the foreskin and glans penis such as inflammation, blackening, and adhesions.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These complications often occur on the penis and there is an accumulation of ugly flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And some of this is malignant, while other parts are not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore the non-malignant parts you should remove with a fine hook, cutting them away until you have cleaned it all out.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place over it a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound afterwards with dauphine ointment until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	But if the complication is malignant, discoloured, then you should apply a caustic to it after its excision and scraping.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	However if the complication is on a captive foreskin of an uncircumcised person and there are parts of the complication inside the foreskin and others outside it; you should first remove the internal part of the complication until it heals over, then treat the external wound; for when you treat both at once, the foreskin will not heal without becoming perforated.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And these complications also occur on the testicles as blackening and inflammation of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	You must therefore hollow out completely whatever has already turned black and what is rotting or has already rotted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then pour over it after that some honey which has already been shaken with flour of pomegranate skins and crushed herbs which have been sifted.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	But if there should be an outflow of blood, then apply the lunar caustic according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the caustic is helpful for two conditions at once, namely an outflow of blood and a wound when it has become putrid.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	But if the head of the rod is eroded and it is destroyed completely within an hour: then you must insert into the orifice of the priapism a leaden pipe so that the patient urinates through it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the case of adherence of the foreskin to the head of the rod, and this kind of adherence does not occur except in someone whose foreskin is healthy and has not been circumcised: and sometimes there may be adhesion because of a wound or an abscess: you must therefore scrape it away with a blunt spatulum until the ligament is loosened and the head of the rod becomes free on all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish these with precision, then you must scrape away something from the head of the rod and also something from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because when the foreskin is thin it may be perforated quickly on account of its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the rod with a piece of fine linen cloth which has already been moistened in cold water so that they do not stick together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated with astringent wine until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the cleansing of infants and the cure for any errors occurring to them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not the solution to continence, like other wounds; however, since it is due to our action, with our will, and its use is proper among boys, we must mark this operation as improved, and lead a smoother path towards health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is because I have found that most craftsmen and blood-letters use the cleansing method, performing circumcision with a razor and scissors, and using caustic agents and ligatures with thread, and incisions with a lancet.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I have indeed tested all these methods, and have not found a better method of cleansing than with scissors and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the foreskin's skin has two layers; therefore, perhaps the upper layer is cut and the lower layer tears; thus it requires a second incision, causing pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the cleansing done by caustic agents, which is a Digitalis plant that shoemakers use, the incision of the male member's tip is not secured because it might enter its hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In the cleansing done by a lancet, perhaps its iron is pushed in and ruins your operation; also, boys' skin is naturally short, and they often are born like this so that they don't need to be cleansed at all, and I've seen it myself.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	The process of wound cleansing with scissors and the ligation with thread has proven to be a good experience for me: since the scissors are proportionate to the incision; therefore, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When you therefore place your hand with the above premises, the two sharp edges are proportioned and make an incision at one operation in a single time: and a compression of similar figure is made, containing the skin of the rod from every side, with which no mistake whatsoever can fall.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the way of doing this operation is that you make it seem to a child, especially if he is one who understands somewhat, that you are not doing anything except tying the thread around his rod only: and you leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then you make him rejoice and be merry in every way possible for you from the fact that he understands it himself.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then you make him stand between your prepared hands and not be seated: and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then you insert your hand into his rod and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the rod comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then you cleanse it from what collects on it of filth.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then you tie the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards, tie below it somewhat of another ligation.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then you hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligation with a good grip, and make an incision between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then raise the skin upwards quickly, and extract the head of the needle.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then allow the blood to run slowly (for it is better) and place powder on top; and on the powder a cloth spread with the strained broth of a boiled kid, mixed with good fresh rose oil; and leave him on this until the next day: and treat it with the remaining cure, until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	This is the form of the scissors for cleaning.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	There should be two sharp pointed ends, and they should meet; lest the branch of the nail slip out: and let the length of the two points be equal to the combined length of both handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	A mistake that can occur during cleaning is when the inner skin may escape entirely or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	So you must pull it out with your fingernail at the right time before the place is cauterized: and cut it evenly.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then extract it with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if three days pass and what remains under the swollen rod becomes an abscess; then leave it until the abscess subsides to a warm spot, and scrape it away gently, and cut it according to how it presents itself to you: and beware of the head of the needle.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not do him any harm.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	So treat it with what heals wounds made from the powders we described in the chapter on powders; and if a wound is cut through the skin above measure and reaches upwards, this will not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Take care of it with what we have said until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction produced from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh and similar things among those we have said from the ways of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not loosened and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it should be that the patient is bent over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet should be arranged upon his back and he should stretch out his belly from the upper part of his back and the patient should draw in his breath as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	He is thus forced with the neck of the bladder towards excretion of the stone at the back: wherefore the urine is discharged.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	But if it is not loosened with what we have said and the matter is difficult for the patient: then it should be that you administer its extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of this form It should be made from silver, and should be fine, soft, curved like a bird's quill in fineness equal to that of a radius, long as one-and-a-half palms: to which there should be a fine nozzle at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the way of exit of urine through it is that you take a doubled thread and tie at its end wool or cotton with good binding: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe: and cut with scissors if anything superfluous remains from the wool, but introduce it into the nozzle firmly like a plug.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then lubricate the syringe with oil, or with butter and egg white; and have the patient sit on a seat, and broach the fistula, and his member with moistened wool, olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the member with ease until you reach the root of the member.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it above on the upper part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside until you reach the bladder and the patient feels that he has reached an empty thing; and this does not happen according to this order unless because the passage into which it enters is one with a twist.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then withdraw the thread along with some wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The worm will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract it and make the worm run through the urine passage; and repeat with the syringe and do not cease doing this until the fistula is evacuated and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the subject of the cleansing of the bladder with a syringe.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When there is an ulcer or a clot of blood in the bladder, or it contracts and pushes pus into it, and you wish to introduce water and medicines into it; then do so with the instrument that is called a syringe, and this is its form: [at this point, Albucasis inserts an illustration].
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is a closed nozzle.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And on it there are three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	The hollow place where the object is pushed contains a quantity that fills it without addition until such time as something is drawn with it and moisture is attracted; and when it is forced along, what is expelled far away with it according to what does a clepsydra - which projects naphtha, or Greek fire in battles of Mars
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	Therefore if you want to throw moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the moisture and draw up with it what is being pushed upwards because moisture is drawn into the hollow part of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its end into the tube as we described for the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push the moisture with what pushes that moisture through to the bladder immediately so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Use a slender enema to give an enema of the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Make it of silver or latten, whose head is higher than a small alcam and under which is a hollow into which the catheter drops.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a goat's bladder and put in it the moisture with which you want to give an enema of the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between the two hollows with a strong ligature of double thread and warm that moisture slightly over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the enema into the tube and after that squeeze your hand over the bladder with a suitable tightness until the patient feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If you do not have a bladder at hand then take a piece of parchment and make out of it a circle and pierce it with holes throughout all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a thread firmly into those holes as they revolve.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle as you would an egg yolk; after you place into it whatever you desire of moistures and oils and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it into the instrument; and work with it as you did with the bladder from an expression by hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the extraction of stones.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken about the types of stones and their treatment with medicines; I mentioned the difference between a stone formed in the kidneys, bladder, and signs of it overall; I spoke of the stone operation that requires handwork and incision, which is a stone properly formed in the bladder; and one fixed on a rod. And here I am narrating it again with clear exposition and abridgement.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say, therefore, that the stone formed in the bladder mostly happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs is that the urine comes out of the bladder like water due to its subtle nature; and white sand appears in it, and the patient rubs his penis, labours with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then the anus rises too and comes out with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing is easy for boys until they reach fourteen years of age.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	However, for young men it is average; that which falls between the extremes: for those whose stone is larger, healing is easier; and if small, their cure is the opposite.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we reach the stage of treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with an enema that will extract all the feces from their intestines; for sometimes this very thing prevents finding the stone during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient should be taken by their feet and shaken, and moved towards the lower parts; so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder or jump out from a higher place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then have him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands should be under his hips so that the bladder is fully sloped towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then feel him up and down, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you therefore feel the stone within reach, then proceed immediately with an incision over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall within your reach at all, then you must wipe your left hand's index finger with oil and insert it into the anus of a child; or the middle finger for a full-grown youth; feel around until the stone lies beneath your finger, and gradually turn it towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on the stone with your finger and push it towards the exterior at the spot where you want to make an incision; tell one assistant to press the bladder with their hand, another to lift the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with the other hand to remove the skin which is below the testicles in a part away from the place of the section.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the scalpel, which is shaped like this: [description of the shape].
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	Make the incision at a spot that lies between the anus and testicles but not in the middle; rather to the left side of the buttocks: let your finger be inside the anus while the section is made over the stone itself, and make a transverse cut so that it opens widely on the outside and narrowly on the inside according to how large an exit for the stone seems possible.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed the finger compresses a stone that is near the incision, and it exits without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you should know that the stone with angles and edges is of a kind from which results difficulty in its exit due to this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And it is smooth, like a gland, and round; and its exit becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore for those with angles and edges, add it to the crack.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not exit thus, then you should apply your skill to it: or bind over it with a stick whose end is like the moon, which binds over the stone and does not come out from it; or introduce beneath it a fine instrument of curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you cannot succeed with this, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If anything of blood defeats you, cut it away with the scissors.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if there is more than one stone, then push first the larger towards the bladder's mouth.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut over it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterward push the smaller one after that; and do likewise if there are several in twos.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut over it with a great incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens to the sick person that one of two things occurs, either he dies, or there befalls upon him constant dribbling of urine; on account of this, because the place is not at all healed.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But apply its removal until it exits; or apply your skill to its fracture with scissors until you extract it piecemeal.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, aloe, and dragon's blood; compress it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose-scented oil, and cold water: so that the hot abscess may be reduced.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then turn the patient onto their front over their own neck, and do not remove the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have unbound it, anoint the place with water and plenty of oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with daiphino ointment and royal ointment until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If an abscess is added to the wound, and it becomes corroded and similar afflictions occur; for instance if blood congeals in the bladder and prevents urine from passing, which can be recognised by the presence of blood with the urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if any remains, it will lead to the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; oppose every form of it that is convenient for healing until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And during the entire period of treatment, you ought to bind the two thighs together for medicinal purposes.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	But if the stone is small and lodged within the urethra, pressing upon it, and obstructing urine's passage; then treat it with what I've described before you resort to cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	You are often spared cutting by this treatment since I have already proved it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And you should take a perforator made of iron, its form like this: triangular tip, sharp, fixed to wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie it with that rod under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing iron into that rod easily until you reach the stone with the perforator; and turn the perforator with your hand on the stone little by little: and try its piercing so as to make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For urine is immediately discharged.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outside part of the rod.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it breaks up by itself, comes out with urine, and the patient is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment is not prepared for you due to something that prevents it; then tie a thread under the stone and another thread over the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on that rod between the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	After that, loosen the binding, and clean frozen blood from the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone unless for fear that it should return into the bladder: and another binding over (it) lest when you loosen the thread after exit of the stone, skin will return to its place and cover wound; and for this reason it must be done by you at your tying of upper thread so as you lift up the skin upwards such that on completion of yours it returns and covers the wound as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	The removal of bladder stones in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Bladder stones are rarely formed in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If one of them has bladder stones, then the treatment is difficult, and it is prohibited due to many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these is that perhaps the woman is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is that you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a doctor when she is chaste or from among married women.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is that you do not find a woman who knows this craft well, especially manual operations.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the stone's location, which requires deep incisions; there is fear in this.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity calls for it, then you should take a female doctor who is well-versed; and she is rarely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you lack her, then seek a chaste and skilled doctor and present an experienced female midwife or a woman who is knowledgeable in this craft; make her present and especially instruct her to do all that you tell her regarding the investigation of the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First is to check if the woman is a virgin; then you must insert your finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If you find it, grasp it with your finger and then instruct the midwife to insert their finger into the weak vulva of the patient and investigate the stone after placing their left hand on her vagina and squeezing it tightly.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If he finds a stone, then he should gradually move it from the urethral opening towards the lower part with all his strength until he reaches the hip joint with it.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he should cut over it at the midpoint of the inguinal region near the hip joint on whichever side is prepared for him and where he feels the stone; and his finger must not be removed from the stone, pressing under it; and let the first incision be small.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he should insert his finger into that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If he feels the stone, then he should make an additional incision of a size proportional to how much the stone is coming out from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you must know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	Of these, some are small or large, smooth or rough, elongated, and round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore you must know its type so that it may be indicated to you by this over what you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If blood overcomes you, then add some crushed ginger to the place for an hour until the bleeding stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and make sure that you have with you all of the instruments which I mentioned for extracting stones from men so as to assist yourself during the procedure.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If a flow of blood overpowers you and you know that it is arterial bleeding from the incision; then apply powder to the place and compress it with suitable swabs: do not change them but let the stone fall out on its own without extracting it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the sick woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wounds.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood is stilled after a day, and the place has become rotten, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Regarding cutting over for a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery ram is not anything but a collection of moisture in the white part that is under the skin containing the egg and this is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own bag which nature prepared for it on the part of the egg until it is supposed to be; and this is another egg and it is a skin of the testicle between the white sifac that we mentioned; but this does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of these watery rams is indeed from a weakness that happens to the testicles; because this substance pours out on them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens due to a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colours.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or the colour of it tends to yellow, or it is bloody red, or dirty black, or watery white; and this last one is more common.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which we understand where the collection of water is, are these:
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white part that we mentioned, then the abscess is round and somewhat longer like an egg figure; and there will be no visible testicle because moisture contains it from every side.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture on its own cloth, then the abscess is round with an egg-like part, and because of this a man estimates it to be another [egg].
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if moisture is between the skin of the testes and white scrotum, then it falls under sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish for knowledge of the colour of moisture, then try the colour of the moisture on the abscess with an inserted square, whose shape precedes [it].
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that which emerges on the trace of the inserted [square], judge about what is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to treatment with iron, then you ought to prescribe for the sick person that they be bled if possible for them, and see their body full [of blood].
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should lie on his back on something slightly raised, and place under it many cloths.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit to his left, and direct an attendant to sit at his right side, who will stretch out his penis towards one of the two sides of the skin of the testes and towards the navel.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a very wide spatula and cut the skin of the testes from the middle lengthwise towards the pubic bone: and let the incision be made according to an equally distant straight line that divides the skin of the testes, until it reaches the white scrotum; and scrape [the skin] and watch, or avoid this by cutting it off: and let your scraping with which you scrape it be from the part that hangs lower with the egg: and carefully examine with the scraping according to as much as is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the water-filled scrotum with a wide puncture, and extract all of the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the scrotum upwards, but do not touch the skin covering the testicles; then cut the scrotum as best you can, either all at once or in pieces, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	If you do not carefully examine it, there will be no safety in the incision unless water returns.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the egg comes out of its skin during your operation: then when you have finished the scrotal incision, push it back in.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like other wounds until they heal.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find the egg blackened and rotten, then it is necessary to tie up the vessels that are its suspension, lest there be a hemorrhage.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspension and extract the egg; afterwards treat it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water has collected in two places then know that there are two branches; so cut the other side as you have done to the first equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it should fall to you to do one operation then proceed as follows: afterwards wash the blood away.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose-oil; and place outside other wool that you have steeped in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles and navel; and put doubled cloths on top of them, which are compresses; and tie these on top with a bandage having six folds thus arranged.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Two cloths should be taken and soaked, then filled with powdered pomegranate rind prepared according to this formula: the ends that are compressed should be made of cotton or damp wool; they will be bound together with a bandage around the upper arms; one end reaches from above the anus up to the back, while the other goes toward the breast region; the two further ends go over the two thighs below, and the two remaining ends pass over both groins. The whole is then bound tight with a bandage round the upper arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	Sometimes this abscess is treated artificially with the cautery instead of cutting it open with an iron instrument; and you should take a fine lancet-shaped cautery and cut the skin covering the testicles with it; and let it be heated as we have described until white pus containing water appears; then take the cautery in this shape.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	This phrase is written in medieval Latin. The translation of 'assimilar' is to assimilate or resemble, however, the whole sentence does not make sense grammatically nor semantically when translated into English. There seems to be a part missing at the end of this sentence that would give it more context and meaning.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then bore this with the cautery until white pus containing water comes out; and let it be heated as we have described until all moisture has been discharged.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then open this abscess with hooks, scrape it with a fine heated cautery and cut into it as far as possible until you remove all of the matter inside.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	Take care that fire does not come in contact with the egg.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you should be aware that this procedure is safer, less prone to causing blood flow and better than cutting open the wound.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if during the cutting or cauterization process you encounter any complications such as hot abscesses, blood flow, or something else; then you must treat this complication with the appropriate therapy described above.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect to survive this operation due to its horrific nature: then perform the perforation as I have described it, and that will be sufficient.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you have confirmed for yourself, as we described regarding the indications, that the limb is waterlogged: then it is necessary to make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Next, perforate the abscess in its lower part with a spatula that is one finger-width wide: and make the perforation according to the length of the body, leaving it open until all the water has drained out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a poultice on the spot and bind it in place, leaving it so that any remaining water can drain out: then treat the wound until it is fully healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however there is an impediment to the water draining at the time when you perforate it: and this happens because the white membrane impedes progress through the wound's opening, preventing the water from exiting: then you should insert a feather into the wound, or else a tool for extracting hydroptic fluid that has already been used previously: or else add something to the operation of the wound itself.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And be aware that water will return and accumulate after around six months have passed.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	Once it has therefore accumulated, then it should be perforated in the same way again, allowing the patient to pass their days accordingly.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On treating fleshy excrescences:
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Be aware that in this excision of the fleshy growth, fear leads many to their death.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it appears to me that his dismissal is a means to preserve [the patient's] health.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I recall performing an operation on it, and the type of abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, then, that many abscesses occur in the body, from which testicles are formed; and this happens for many reasons, to wit.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from an acute excess, or an acrid one, which is discharged into the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the colour of the abscess is like that of the body, and no pain is felt; and the abscess is severe.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, of a dark colour, and no sensation is felt [with it].
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the knotting of arteries, and their swelling; as has already been recalled above; or from the swelling of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That which is from these [abscesses] from the swelling of arteries is recognized by the arrangement of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And one must not touch it directly [to examine it].
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which happens from the swelling of veins does not discharge anything upon compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that an incision may be made over this type [of abscess], and over the remaining flesh; and it must be done by cutting through the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the egg upwards, and extract it with a white cloth; and free the spermatic cord from the testicles, and tie the testicles; and cut the spermatic cord after you free it from every part of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If the egg is consolidated with those newborn meats, then you must draw out the egg and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between something from the siphon or that which is between the vases, then you must free all that adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If, however, there is a birth of meat in the place of adhesion which is behind, then you must cut all of it and extract the egg as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Once your operation is complete, fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine; then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On treating piles which is with leeches... (Translation incomplete as text was truncated)
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	A grape is an abscess wrapped in a certain wrapping, like a boil, with softening of the testicles; and it becomes difficult for the patient to move, exercise, or walk.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded its remembrance.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	Indeed we must say the procedure for it as the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say, therefore, that you must make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the supporter of the testicles to the bottom.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with vases which are near the rod; and let another assistant hold it, and stretch it with a violent stretching.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a sharp, two-span wide spatula with a transverse cut across the straight vessels until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape off all the skin as we have previously instructed you when removing arteries from the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Afterwards fasten to these a needle which has twice the length of thread and tie it on the first spot where they happen upon vines; then tie it again at their last end.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut it open at the middle crosswise along its length and extract what has coagulated out of foul humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment for other wounds that you wish to produce pus so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles may fall out.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not an evil for this reason.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if the vine happens to all vessels then it is necessary that for this reason the testicles be removed with their vessels so that they are not deprived of egg nourishment because of an incision and shrivel up or dry out and cannot produce offspring with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the treatment of intestine roots.
Caput LXV.	Head 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The cause of these roots is from an incision that happens in the sifach extended over the abdomen in the groin area below mirach stomach.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines come down from that rupture to one of the testicles?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the sifach or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	These two types happen for many reasons such as a blow or jumping or shouting or lifting something heavy and the like.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign is when there is an extension of the sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is what happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly; it is an equal abscess towards the deep part because the sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And its sign is when there is a cutting of the sifach because it causes severe pain to happen suddenly at first; and it is an abscess that faces inwards, appearing under the skin nearby: and this is due to the exit of the intestine, and its course towards the outer parts of the sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it leaves with the intestine the bag; and this is called 'Ramex intestinalis', and a hernia; and sometimes it happens with wind.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes feces run into the intestine and are retained there; and it is harmful to the patient because it causes severe pain, especially when pressed upon.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And, with regard to the cure of this disease by means of the knife, there is fear; therefore one must guard against accidents therein.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the way of operating is to order the patient, if he obeys returning, to reduce the intestine with his hand into the interior of his hollow.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then let him lie prone on his neck between your hands; and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows onto the upper skin, and cut all the scrotal skin lengthwise.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision according to what you need for opening the incision with them; and let the incision be made as wide as possible so that an egg can come out through it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Scrape the scrotum and what is under the skin of the testes until you uncover a white, hard sifach from all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white sifach underneath the skin, and the second sifach, and absolutely with it, the adhesion that is in the posterior part of the scrotum.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand towards the interior of the testicle's skin and as you do so, stretch the white sifach upwards with your left hand; raise the testicle together with the sifach to the side of the incision and ask an assistant to stretch the testicle upwards while you release the adhesion that is behind it once this process is complete.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	Use your fingers to check there is nothing from the intestine wrapped around the white, hard sifach.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	However, if you find anything from it, push this to the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Next, take a needle with a thick thread made of ten threads of linen and insert it in the last sifach, that is, the skin covering the testes which follows the incision; then cut the protruding ends of the thread until you are left with four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Compose some of these threads over the others in a cross-like figure and tie them with this alsifach, which we have mentioned as being under the skin of the testes by the strong ligament; do so until neither vessel can send anything to nourish it for fear of causing a hot abscess.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	Place another ligament on top of the first one, outside of it, at least two fingers away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	After these two ligaments have been placed, remove from the sifach under the skin of the testes an amount equivalent to a finger's length; then cut away all the remainder around it in a circular fashion and take out the testicle.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut off the lower part of the scrotal skin with a surgical instrument, from which blood and pus flow, as we described earlier.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Next, apply wool soaked in oil to the wound: and use the ligature as described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white cautery we mentioned is used, after its incision to stop the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the ligature in place until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If however its falling off is delayed, then it should be soaked with warm water: and the item we mentioned should be placed on it until it falls away.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Next treat the wound with the remaining standard treatments for wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Regarding Ramice spongiosa (cancellous bone).
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 61.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this type of spongy bone I have not seen anyone who has dared to operate on it with a knife.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And those who first discovered this said that it happens as we described for spongy bone accompanied by periosteum.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, you should bind strips of cloth to the bones after its incision with ease below; then cut it in the middle, and treat it finally using what opens it, until the strips fall away: and treat the wound as we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Regarding ruptures which occur in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 62.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we mentioned, and the site protrudes, and not any part of the intestines descends to the testicles: but if it does descend, that is little, and it returns every hour: truly if time passes with this, a fissure is added to the scrotum until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And it happens due to an extension of the scrotum, which is located in the groin, as we mentioned.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the scrotum extends; then it softens, the site becomes abscessed, and it protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with cauterization, as the previous account has stated.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cured with iron, in this manner: that is, for the patient to lie on their back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the abscessed and protruding site of the rupture with an incision across its width, according to the length of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then grasp the alifac and that which is beneath the skin until it has been pulled out; when the white scrotum underneath the skin following it is detected.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take an iron rod and place it on the protruding site of the scrotum, pushing it down deep into the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew the two protruding sites at the end of the iron rod from the scrotum, attaching one to the other with a suture; then extract the end of the iron rod.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not make an incision at all into the scrotum, nor stretch the testicles or anything else, as I have made you aware of previously regarding treatment for hernia of the intestines.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with a cure for wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you cut the thread, clean it, and restore the wound until it is healed.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For sisach contracts, and does not add to the prominence of rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And a caustic is better in this place, for it is nearer to the cure.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On softening the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles softens often in certain men, which causes the flesh between them to soften and disfigure their appearance.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	So it is necessary for him who seeks its cure to make the patient lie face down on his back and cut away all of the skin which has softened onto their natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then gather the two lips together with a suture; and if you wish, sew the superfluity of softened skin first with three or four sutures, then secure the wound.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat any remaining wounds until they heal and the stitches fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	On castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is forbidden by our law; and for this reason it might be permissible for me not to recall it in my book at all; yet its recollection proves necessary in two ways.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of these is so that the physician may possess knowledge when asked about it; and to know its cure for one who has undergone such a thing.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	One other method is that we often require the castration of certain animals for our use as livestock, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar among animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that castration is performed in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Either by scraping or cutting off the testicles.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by making an incision and then dividing [the testes].
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In the procedure that is done by scraping or cutting off the testicles, the way of operating is as follows: have the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and relax and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer apparent to touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In the procedure that is done by making an incision and then dividing [the testes], you must hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligament and cut above each egg with one incision until two eggs appear; then make an incision in them after you have scraped away the tunics of both, without allowing anything to come out except for a thin film over the vas deferens.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than the one done by scraping or cutting off the testes because abrasion may leave something from the testicles so that the animal still has desire for intercourse.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	On caring for an hermaphrodite, there are two methods.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	An hermaphrodite comes from men in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears on what follows the space or on the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva, with hair; and sometimes urine runs from what is on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	There is one type in women, and it is the woman's vulva like a man's small testicles entirely prominent to the outside; of which one is like Priapus [an ithyphallic deity], and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the cure for three types [of this condition], two from men and one type from women, is: because you must cut away the added flesh until the impression of them has disappeared.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat it with the cure for other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	For the second type of men from which urine comes out, that is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation and nor is there any cure for it at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On incising warts and raised flesh on the vulva of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	A wart is perhaps added on top of the natural [part], until it becomes ugly and its appearance becomes unsightly; and sometimes it grows in some women so much that it becomes enlarged like in men and reaches up to the point of sexual intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	So you must hold the superfluity of the wart with your hand or a hook and cut it; and do not hesitate to make the incision, especially at the root that is deep down; so that heavy bleeding does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the cure for wounds until it has healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	Flesh that grows at the opening of the womb is flesh that develops until it fills up said space; and perhaps extends to the outside in a form resembling a tail, and for this reason some of the ancients called the disease 'tailed'.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	We should therefore cut it out like we do with warts, and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of alratic ulceration, which is a woman's unpierced wound.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratic ulceration is when there is an unpierced wound on a woman or a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental alratic ulceration is due to an illness that has occurred beforehand, and it itself arises either from additional flesh born of the womb's lining or its membrane, and happens either deep within the uterus or in its sides, top, or bottom; and prevents intercourse as well as impregnation, childbirth, and perhaps even menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	Its diagnosis is made through the observation of midwives if the obstruction is apparent nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it's not visible, then search for it with your fingers or a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	However, if the obstruction is due to a thin membrane and it's near the two lips of the vagina, then quickly rupture it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And this is done by placing swabs over the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place both your index fingers together; the woman should be on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with strength until the sifach is torn open and the blockage is revealed.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	After that, take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the site; the woman should repeat this daily so that another scar does not form.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the sifach is thick and dense, then it must be cut out with a spatula that is two spans wide, similar to the leaf of a myrtle tree.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	However, if the blockage is made of flesh, then lift it with hooks and cut it; have on hand medicines that will stop blood flow without stinging, such as gum arabic, dragon's blood, and oil mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then insert a lead pipe of sufficient size so that the wound does not heal quickly; leave it in place for several days and apply a linen poultice before treating with other medicines until healing is complete.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when birth defects of other flesh arise, they must be cut out in this way: for as long as the abscess is not a cancerous one (for with a cancerous abscess that is in the womb, iron must on no account be used).
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of haemorrhoids, athehelil, and red botches on women's vulvas.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Haemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the veins until much blood flows out persistently.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When haemorrhoids are dried up they become athehelil; and I have already spoken of the different kinds and their symptoms in another section, and here will say which of them can be treated and which cannot.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say, therefore, that haemorrhoids which are present in the opening of the womb and not apparent to the senses cannot be treated with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those among them which are present in the opening of the womb on which there is an impact from a sense [i.e., that can be perceived], those can be cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary, therefore, to put the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then pull out the haemorrhoids with forceps or an abrasive cloth, cutting them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then sprinkle on them near the flow of blood one powder from the cut up ingredients without mixing: such as acacia [gum arabic], dragon's blood [red resin], frankincense oil and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push her feet to the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards place her into cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	But if the bleeding persists then make her sit in a decoction of sumac [a flowering plant], pomegranate rinds, galls and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar to make a plaster from it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If the blood stops with it then that's good; if not, attach cupping glasses to her back and breasts without scarifying [i.e., making incisions in her skin].
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and soak it in the juice of thapsia [a toxic plant], or the juice of a stingray, or the juice of the branches of the oleander (i.e., dogbane), Pontic wine, and attach it with leather.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the abscess quiets down, then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Barth, however, is red like the heads of garlic, and it has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary, therefore, that you cut out what appears from it, as I said before regarding the equal edges; and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	On the perforation of the cervix which occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	There are many types of abscesses that occur in the womb, such as cancer, stony abscess, ulcer, scrofula, eczema, haemorrhoids, fistulas, anal fissure, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have indeed already described all these diseases and their types, as well as their signs and treatments, in the relevant sections; it is necessary for me to speak in this treatise about hot abscess which occurs in the womb from among the types of abscesses that discharge pus, and you wish to know how its incision with an iron instrument takes place.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary, therefore, for you to pay attention.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the abscess pain in its initial stage is sharp with its throbbing, and burning sensation, and fever; and you see it becoming red; if the sense of feeling falls upon it, then do not hurry with its incision; and treat it with what assists over maturation until such time as the severity of symptoms quiets down.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat washed with two seats, and reclines, or be propped up over her back, and she gathers her feet to the lower part of her belly; and her hips are spread out, and places both arms under her knees, and binds them with two appropriate ligaments to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side and use the tool to open the maternal orifice.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes after them.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And when you want to use this tool, it is necessary that you insert the rod deep into the woman's womb, so as not to let what enters from the instrument go further than the depth of the womb and injure the patient.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	However, if the tool is longer than that depth, then you must place pegs on the cover of the womb's depth to prevent the tool from entering fully into the womb's depth and injuring the patient. It is necessary for the assistant to place the handle which runs in the tool above [or outside] and hold the tool while the assistant rotates the handle until the opening of the womb's depth.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	Once the emerging part is visible, can be touched by hand and feels soft and gentle, it must then be cut at its head with a wide spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the blood is evacuated, it must be treated with linen soaked in rose oil or green [resin] oil that has a certain styptic property; apply the linen and extract the piece from deep within the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally over the womb and on top of the pubic hair clean wool soaked in warm water containing apples.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be treated after two days with the ointment suitable for that until healing occurs.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the womb and wound are washed, such that they are cleansed with an enema of water and honey; then with water boiled with lily root or long aristolochia; before returning to ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If a wound is hidden internally within the womb, then one must refrain from treating it with iron instruments; rather, treat it with what we mentioned earlier in the section on [wounds of] division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Treatise on Obstetrics: How to treat live embryos that emerge with an unnatural shape.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for midwives to recognize the form of normal birth first.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Thus, the signs of this are as follows: when you see a woman pressing down with her lower body, and wanting to sniff the air, and what is above her relaxes, and she hastens the birth of the embryo: then know that this is natural childbirth, and it is an exit over its head, and the second stage is together with it; either suspended or hanging by the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then one ought to compress her abdomen so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends over its head, the second stage descends with it, and is cleaned of those superfluities by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Any birth other than this is unnatural, to be deplored.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	Sometimes a fetus emerges on its feet, and its body comes out before its head, with one or both of its feet and hands; or its head and hands come out; or the breech presents itself; and perhaps it turns over onto its neck, along with similar unnatural forms.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is thus necessary for midwives to be prudent and subtle in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form among them, and how it behaves within this, and what it signifies by that, and how one should sit on top of it [i.e., deliver the baby].
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges on its own head and this causes great strain on the woman, making childbirth difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then have her sit on a chair, or have other women hold her; and apply vapor of wool with fenugreek decoction and moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife should insert a small spatula between her fingers and tear the perineum with it, cutting it with her nail until all of its moisture runs out; and she should press on the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then the woman must be given an enema of fenugreek mucus with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then tell her to press herself together after the enema; make her sneeze with ground cumin, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour at a time.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If the fetus's two hands come out first, you must join them together gently and slowly.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not comply upon entry, then have the woman sit on a chair and raise her feet up; shake the chair onto the ground; and make sure the woman is held so she doesn't fall during the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands still do not come out and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the rest of the fetus; tie its hand with a cloth and draw it out gently; for it shall emerge.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exitus of an embryo whose feet come first.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When a fetus comes out on its feet, then it should be pushed upward; the midwife should slowly turn it around and draw it forth equally.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then he should take one of his feet and stretch it slowly.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they therefore come out as far as the thighs, then bid him be compressed, and make him sneeze with force; for it will come out, if God pleases.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out as we have described, then bring back the fetus little by little until you place it in its natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For itself will then come out with an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	But if it is hindered by all that we have described, then take from the mucilage of the Althaea plant, and oil of Sesamum, and dissolved gum; and beat all these things well in a mortar: then with this, anoint the woman's woolen apron and her lower belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she feels it in the hypochondrium.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that her lower parts are now heated, then make a suppository of myrrh for her: and place it inside.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore she has held the suppository for one hour, then make her sit upon a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze, and hold her mouth and nose shut; then press the lower part of her belly with a gentle pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus should be onto the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out in this manner, then you should deliver by gradually inserting your hands.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lie down on her neck, and let her feet hang towards the floor; she should be lying on a bed, with her hands folded.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gradually upon her abdomen.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then remove what is beneath her feet from the mattresses, until she is prepared in the lower part (of the bed).
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not exit, then take her feet and move them with a violent motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press gradually on what is above the hypocondrium, until the fetus ascends towards the upper part (of the abdomen).
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then introduce your hands and equalize the fetus gradually; tell the woman to push down until the fetus exits (the birth canal).
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus exits hanging horizontally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Her hand should be gently manipulated when being brought back down (to its normal position).
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If you cannot bring her hand back down, then lift the woman up and make her walk (around).
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed; shake her legs with a violent shaking motion.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the ointment you have prepared from the mucilages (linseed).
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she has taken hold of the newborn, then make her sit on a chair (to recover).
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive to bring her hand back down and equalize the fetus according to its natural form; make the woman sneeze and tell her to push until it exits (the birth canal).
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus's exit over its own neck, with hands spread out, and his face is toward his mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife must hold the fetus's hand; then she should gradually rotate it and equalize it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is equalized, then place on its head what we described earlier from oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then order him to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit on a chair and order her to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then order her to be compressed; and make her sneeze with pressure.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The fetus's exit prepared on its side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the uterine orifice with the afterbirth in this way, then cut the afterbirth with your nail until it is evacuated of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended over the fetus's face and its neck, then cut it from the navel; so that it is not retained, and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus into the depths until you place it where it should be; and order the woman to compress herself several times; for it will indeed exit by a light passage.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins or of many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born; and sometimes three, or even four, are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is extraordinary, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	There are five things that are beyond nature and do not truly live; though they increase in number, one caul contains them all, and the navel string separates each from its neighbour.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they are born as a single fetus through the natural and easy exit; or they may be born through the other unmentionable exit, as we have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult at birth and come to that which we have mentioned as an unnatural presentation, then treat them as we have described; let there be a skilled midwife, who will act with skill and caution, and the child must be delivered according to every form with what is prepared for it in order to ensure its safety.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder of what is formed in the womb from embryos, some of which may be aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one is formed in the womb, or two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even more - ten; I have already witnessed a woman who aborted seven fully-formed embryos, while another had aborted as many as fifteen.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	This was ascertained by the measurement of an illustrious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	All this, therefore, ought to be within the knowledge of any obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it may happen to them in a similar way; so they should oppose this with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus as I have described regarding its extraction and it does not come out, and you are forced to use manual manipulation, then you must be mindful of the following.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If the woman is of sound virtue and is not afflicted by any of the conditions that pose a risk to her life, then she should lie on her back on a bed with her head tilted downwards and her legs elevated; an assistant should hold her from both sides or she should be tied to the bed so that her body is not dislodged during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils mixed with marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	The midwife should then anoint her hand with these oils and mixes; she can then easily insert it into the womb.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	She should then seek with her for the place where she can hook the fetus' limbs and suitable places to do so.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore consider, if the fetus is ready to be delivered head-first: hook it by its eyes or neck, mouth, palate, under its chin, armpits, sides or below its ribs.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If, however, it is descending by its feet then hook it by the comb of its head or middle of its back.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	She should hold the hook with her right hand and place its curve between the fingers of her left; she can then easily insert her hand and secure the hook to one of those places mentioned until she reaches an empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she should hook another or even third if needed to ensure equal contraction and prevent any tilt towards one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extracted with equal traction and not just straight but rather moved to all sides so as to ease its exit; in the same way that a tooth is removed.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it must be softened where there is an interval between them to extend it.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part of it is retained, then the midwife must anoint certain fingers with oil and insert them from that side so she can turn with them what has been retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	So if part of the fetus exits, then switch the hooks to another place that is higher: do this until the entire fetus exits.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If one hand exits before the other, and it's not possible to draw it back because of its contraction, then it must be wrapped with a cloth.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then draw it out until it exits completely; cut it either at the ankle or elbow joint: and so you must do this with the other hand and both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the fetus's head is large or it gets stuck during exit, or there's a build-up of water in its head, then one must insert between the fingers a spine-shaped spatula and cut open its head with it to draw out the water; or tear it apart using an instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with forms of other instruments in the chapter that follows this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then one must cut it with an instrument called 'algengematu': or draw it out with a misdach, as we've said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then you must draw the bones out with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head exits and gets stuck at the bifurcation, then it must be cut open until the moisture within the chest is emptied.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it does not form a knot and fails to follow the path out, then cut open the head in pieces as best you can.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If there is an abscess in the lower abdomen or it is swollen with fluid, then you must pierce it until moisture flows out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If the fetus is positioned with its feet first, then it is easy to pull out and guide it towards the mother's pelvis.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If the obstruction is at the abdomen or chest, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; rip open the abdomen or chest until their contents flow out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If the rest of its body is removed and only the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the mother's pelvis is open, then the midwife should insert her hand deep inside and search for the head with her fingers, drawing it towards the mouth of the pelvis; next she must insert a hook or two hooks and pull it out with these.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mother's pelvis is constricted by a hot abscess, then you should not work on it but instead drain off moist and fatty substances; apply poultices and sit in softening and moisturizing waters.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it may be brought straight; next do what we said for a live baby.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If this is not possible, then cut it into pieces and extract it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And you must make sure that nothing of the afterbirth remains inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then apply what we said earlier for hot swellings that occur on the womb.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If there should be any bleeding, then apply styptic waters, and continue with the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have seen a woman whose belly contained a dead fetus; afterwards she became pregnant again on top of it, later the other fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	So it happened to her after a long time that there was a swelling on her navel and it became swollen until it opened up and started discharging pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time; but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I placed on it some of the strongest drawing plasters; and a bone came out from that place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then after some days another bone came out too.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	So I wondered about it because there is no bone inside the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought therefore that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	So I examined the wound and extracted many bones while the woman was in better condition; she has now lived like this for a long time, and only discharges very little pus from that place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not record this here as something strange except that there is knowledge and help for the skilled physician who applies treatment with their hand.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the shapes of instruments necessary for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the form of the bookbinding tool by which books are squared up; it has two vertical rollers at either end of two pieces of wood that are equal in length.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this vertical roller should be finer than that of the bookbinding tool, and for this purpose it can be made either of ebony or boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	The width of each piece of wood should be approximately two fingers; the edge of either end is one finger and the length of each is a palm and a half. In between the two pieces of wood are two smaller additions made from the same material whose length is a half-palm plus just a little more, and their width is about two fingers or slightly larger.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	These two smaller additions are inserted into the jaw of the frame so that it opens with them when you turn the two vertical rollers.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the roller that opens the frame.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to this one, but finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It should be made of ebony or boxwood in the likeness of a pair of pincers.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its end there are two additions as you see above, and the length of each addition is about a palm; their width is approximately two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you wish to open the frame with this tool, then have the woman sit on a bed with her feet hanging down and what is between her legs exposed.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Insert the two connected additions into the frame, holding the end of the tool between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, evenly according to the size of the opening of the womb's mouth, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of another vertigo which they said was the same as that of something pushing, by which the fetus is pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of the Almisdac by which the large head is crushed: and it resembles a pair of forceps with teeth at the end, as you can see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made oblong, like forceps of this shape, as you can see, with teeth like a saw's, by which the head is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of the Almisdac by which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of the 'Vuncus' with one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of the 'Vuncus' with two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps with saw-like teeth by which the fetus's head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of the 'Spatumilus' with two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two wide 'Spatumili'.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are used and the more their types multiply and are prepared by the artisan, the faster they are for his procedure and the higher in esteem among people because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, do not despise any of these instruments that is not prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	Indeed the need for them is undeniable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the extraction of the secundine (amniotic sac).
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When secundine is retained during childbirth, you should instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with powder; press your hand over her mouth and nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it therefore comes out by this means, that is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not, then take a pot and make a hole in its lid; put into it herbs that open the womb's mouth, such as calament, rue, dill, chamomile, sage, woody cassia, and centaury: take all these herbs or some of them and immerse them with water, then place them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a reed stick over the hole of the pot's lid and the other end into the womb's mouth; let her hold it until the steam reaches the womb's cavity.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze as we said before.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	Indeed, the secundine will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if it remains after this treatment and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in oil of turpentine or marshmallow mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then she should insert her hand into the vulva and search for the secundine with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When she finds it, she should grasp it and gradually extend it.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it is attached deep inside the womb, then she should insert her hand as we described until finding the secundine and extract it slowly along its length so that the womb does not fall from a strong pull; rather, it needs to be turned gently to right and left sides: afterwards apply an amount of traction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	Indeed, it then obeys, and is preserved, and comes away from adhesions.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the womb is contracted, as we have already explained: treat it with sneezing and with a medicated pot of herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not come out with everything we have mentioned, then take care not to tire yourself out over it in the process of extracting it.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But whatever comes out at the womb's opening from it, you should tie to the woman's thigh.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then give her an enema with the ointment tetrapharmacon.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will indeed cause her to go bad after days, and be dissolved, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it goes bad, an unpleasant smell is raised from it to the belly and head, which harms the sick woman.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of watercress, and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The shape of an instrument by which the woman is fumigated in the case of a retained afterbirth, and of menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	It should be made of a glass bottle similar to an alcama or out of zere: and the broad end is placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be set upon coals: hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the cure of anus which is not perforated.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born with their anuses not perforated, which has already been skillfully plugged by a membrane.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, it is necessary that the midwife perforate this membrane with her finger; and if not, she must do so using a sharp spade; taking care of the testicles, lest they be touched.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	After that, treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	However, if you fear that it will become blocked again, then place a leaden tube in the hole for many days and remove it when the boy can defecate without difficulty.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now an anal blockage also happens due to the scarring of wounds or from pus.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore it is necessary that this scar be cut open; then it must be treated in the same way as we have described for the treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the cure of fistulas that occur in the lower part [of the body].
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	The fistulas that occur below are nodules and swellings which arise near the anus on the outside; or they happen in the space of a single area; and there is one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When this nodule has aged it is opened up; and from it runs a whitish watery fluid or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes there arise penetrating fistulas from these.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Penetrating fistulas are recognised by what comes out during defecation and flatulence, when the patient is suffering from diarrhoea; and perhaps worms come out of them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are among them fistulas that penetrate into the space reaching up to the bladder and up to the urethra of the penis.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And there are among them penetrating ones reaching up to the hip joint and up to the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that by which a penetrating fistula up to the anus is recognized, there is also one that does not penetrate; you should insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe of brass or iron into the fistula when it is not tortuous.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is a tortuosity in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe or a horsehair until you feel the probe or the hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it penetrate fully and nothing comes out of the orifice in terms of discharge nor is there any windiness or worms as I said, then know that it does not penetrate; therefore, hasten to its cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating up to the bladder or the urethra of the penis, its sign is that urine will come out from it and it being prevented from this so that the place might be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it is penetrating up to the hip joint or the bone of the hip, then its sign is that a probe reaches there if there is no tortuosity in it all the way to the bone; and finding pain around that part, and pus always coming out from it: and that medicine does not hold in it nor can it be consolidated with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And for all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their cure is difficult and vain for the foolish doctors on whom they form.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In non-penetrating wounds that are not old, healing is expected with a knife; as I tell you and have already proven; the patient lies on their back between your hands; elevate their legs up to above the hips and bend the hips towards their belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce a lead or brass probe until you know where the fistula ends.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If however the patient feels it around the anus then you must introduce your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel the probe has penetrated and gone through what was detected, beyond what you feel between your finger and the fistula wall or flesh then you know for certain it is a penetrating wound; do not labor over it as there is no healing for it as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They say that flesh can heal and be of benefit to some men from medication; make a fine hot iron according to the size of the fistula as previously described and introduce it into the fistula until it reaches near the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat this twice or three times until you know that all those added filtered flesh parts which are like a bird's quill have been cauterized.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then dress it with linen bandages steeped in butter until those cauterized flesh parts come out; then treat it with flesh-generating and consolidating ointments.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it heals then that is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the probe comes out at another spot and does not reach your finger that is inside the anus; there being between it and the place of issue a thick covering of flesh or a sifac: and you see a fistula in what follows along the surface of the skin, then cut away the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and proceed cutting with the probe that is in the fistula until the cutting reaches where the end of the probe comes to; and the probe is freed and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those pieces of flesh which resemble the tube of a bird's quill so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if blood should overcome you and force a separation between yourself and your operation so that you have to desist from cutting those pieces of flesh; it is then better done and more quickly healing if you cauterize it with fire or with a caustic medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For a red-hot iron combines the good qualities of contracting the tissues it burns, checking the blood, and drying up the humors.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then dress it with lint wrapped in butter, or leaves that have been bruised until the place gives out pus and the burnt pieces of flesh come away into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments that produce tough flesh; and these are medicines which have both an astringent and desiccating effect.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are restored, then already it is healed; and you need not fear repetition [of the dressing].
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has already reached deep inside the anus and is drawn out by the redundancy of the body; then insert your finger into the anus, and probe with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If you feel that there is a membrane or flesh between yourself and the patient, which is close to being penetrated, then an operation should not be performed unless it is along the path of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	It is because one of three methods should be administered on it: either you cauterize it as we have said; or cut it away until you reach its concave shape so that it becomes possible for you to introduce the licinia and nearby cure.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed with the cutting too much so that you may not cut into the muscle containing the anus and it happens on the weak excretion of waste without consent.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cure it with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be cured; or you may stretch the membrane and clean it after you cut it close to the anus as we said either with a probe or another sharp instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those flesh fragments which are exposed by the cut until you can with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the restoration of the whole wound with cutting and superior opening where it hardens; and there remains a fistula open on the inside part of the anus, and will be lighter on the weak.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes a fistula follows in this way; that is when you introduce the probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus about the surface of the body with skin and edge of the anus; then take the perforated end which is like a needle, namely preparing leather, according to this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into it a thread rolled up of five threads, and about the same.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then introduce the probe with a thread into the fistula until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If it is penetrating the margin of the anus internally close by, then extract the thread from that hole so that you insert your finger into the anus and withdraw the end of the thread and gather both ends together: and pull on each one, and leave it for a day or two days: and as much as the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until those parts of the flesh which are between the two ends of the thread drop off: then treat the wound until it heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating then make it penetrate by whatever means prepares itself for you unless it be very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it does not lie in your power to make that happen so that you do not cut into it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound as we have said until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	Make a spatula with thorns which divides the fistula, whose curvature is very acute and one part of it is not acute so that it does not cut into what need not be, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the sewing up of haemorrhoids from which blood flows out due to their cutting: and on treating fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Head 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	Haemorrhoids occur in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they occur inside the anus resembling bags of charcoal or plums or else like actual grains of wheat.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And they come small or large: and blood flows from them always either one alone or many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	There are some outside the anus and at its extreme ends.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are mostly of little moisture, from which runs yellow water or a persistent flow of blood; and they correspond in colour to the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment for that which is inside the anus is to advise the patient to go and have a bowel movement; and it shall be expressed until it comes out of the anus, and you should see what appears to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore also hang them with hooks; or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they do not hold in the hooks because of their moisture and softening; then take them with a rough cloth or with a cotton swab made from double-weave woollen material, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them again, and sprinkle over them after cutting some hot powders, so that they remain in place as a caustic.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterise them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterisation.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then cure them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	But if the anus does not comply with exiting, then give the patient an enema of a small dose of medicine, so that it washes away what is inside the anus, and complies quickly with exit when the patient evacuates.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however they are extrinsic from the anus, then their case is light and easy; and it shall be that you take them with your nail or take them with a hook and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Treat them with what we have described until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And for those who dread the cutting with an iron blade, you must administer stitches to them in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take some wound thread, and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw the needle towards you, and make it penetrate with its point from the other side; and wind two turns of thread around the lower part of the needle to be crossed laterally; then tie the needle firmly with a strong ligature.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread, and draw out the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the ligatures, leaving one of them; do not tie it too tightly so that excess blood may flow from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over the wound a cloth soaked in rose oil or caarob syrup, and put it on the wound; and instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it there until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the ligatures have fallen off, treat them with ointments and the rest of their treatment until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Indeed they often happen due to drying out of the faeces and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they are thus hardened and medicine is of no avail, you must scrape them with the point of a spatula or your nail until they become moist, and remove from them the upper layer which prevents their healing.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them until they heal as required.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not heal, treat them again with greater force than the first time, until they bleed a lot and then dress them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	The treatment of inverted and not-inverted piles, and drying them with alum or ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that a pile is only a round knot, the same colour as the body, resembling the head of a nail; it can occur anywhere on the body, particularly in the lower parts of the feet and toes; they cause pain when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is therefore necessary to cut what surrounds the head of the nail and hold it with forceps or a hook, then root out its base.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat it; if you wish, cauterise it according to what was prescribed in its own chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	A dry pile is a small, rough elevation, like a grain, raised above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	They often occur on children's hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	To treat it, you should stretch the pile and cut it; or bind it with silk thread, or with a hair until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	If you wish, cauterise it with fire or a caustic substance as has been mentioned; now invert the pile and remove both inverted and normal piles with the instrument I shall name.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	An ant is also a small grain raised above the surface of the body and going deep down; when it meets cold, one feels in it something like an ant bite; it occurs all over the body but mostly on the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	The cure for this is to take a small tube made from a goose quill, or a strong vulture's feather; place the tube over an ant until it fills the circle of the tube with its body parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the tube until you cut what is around the ant; place it deep into the flesh and root out the ant from its foundation.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do this with an air or iron tube in this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the top of the tube be made to a pointed edge that is rolled inward so as to ease its grip on his finger and its own rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish to cauterize the ant, as has been mentioned previously about cauterizing Atheli's wound in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	On the shapes of instruments that are applied to enemas for ailments of the anus, bowel movements, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes an enema is made of silver, brass, cast or wrought bronze.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made of these small or large instruments, depending on those into which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	So that which is administered for the cure of little children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, their enemas will also be so.
Clistere magnum.	Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its tube, that is the upper part into which a bag is tied, should be wide in this way; and it should have markings so you can tie its bag as you see fit, and let its lower end which is inserted into the anus be blunt, that is closed, very soft, tapering to a fine point: and on one of its sides are two holes, and on its other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	The diameter of the hole should be according to the thickness of the needles and not too thick; they are inserted into a vessel made from an animal's bladder or from thin goat skin, which is shaped like a small asophras with one palm-sized root.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be pierced with many holes like an egg-turning instrument; there should be the space between each hole equal to the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into these holes a strong raw thread made of ten or so threads and attach to it an oval-shaped bag like that of the asophras.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When this vessel is put on, it should be tied at the head of the enema syringe between its two knobs with a strong binding.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then administer an enema with this device.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	This is the shape of the circular vessel depicted here, as well as its holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of administering an enema with this device is such that you fill the bag or bladder with medicine that has been heated according to the patient's tolerance; be careful not to make it too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient should lie on their back and raise their legs; place under them an inthan (leather) or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Next lubricate the tip of the enema syringe with oil or with white of egg, or with fenugreek mucus, or with similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus gently.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	The attendant should then take the bag with both hands and squeeze it forcefully until everything inside the syringe has been emptied into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then extract the clister, and raise the invalid's legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If medicine thinks he is coming to an end, then hold on as long as you can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night long, it is more likely to be of help.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	However, if you give him an enema in the sickness of his stomach, and he hurries to his end: then repeat the enema until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are haemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let it be a very fine, gentle enema, with the kind of enemas children are given.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And let this be the form of a gentle enema for when the skin is tight.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the cure of head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already said in the division of cures for wounds that it suited this book, and I will say here the cure of them with the hand, and with medicines according to what is needed.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say then, that wounds are differentiated according to the way in which they are made, and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things by which wounds are made are often like the throwing of a stone: or the incision of a sword, or a knife: or being struck with a spear, or wood, or an arrow: and many other similar objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that are made according to the place on the body are like a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the flank: and similar of those members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	I am describing cures for certain wounds so that I may apply this reasoning and rule to other injuries.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I shall begin with simple head wounds, since the discussion of compound injuries will come at the beginning of chapter three.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When there occurs in the head a simple wound and no bone fracture: consider then if it be from a blow of a stone or similar, and has already broken only the skin; and is an extensive wound, and you fear that its outcome will be unfavourable, inflamed swelling: then proceed at once with a cephalic phlebotomy, without delay; and extract from him blood according to the degree of his strength: if nothing prevents it from performing a phlebotomy on him, especially if the blood which comes out of the wound is scanty.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And caution the patient against over-eating, wine, and coarse food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if something prevents him from having soft food, then let his diet be reduced in quantity, and let him not approach meat or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And apply to the wound, if an inflamed swelling occurs there, a poultice steeped in rose oil alone, or with wine that has some styptic power.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are confident that there is no danger of inflamed swelling, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh and contains its own blood, and has not been exposed to air, some powder which I shall describe shortly: And if already it has changed due to exposure to air, then apply over it certain ointments until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large or caused by an incision from a sword and similar injuries: if its lips do not join together with poultices, then bring them together yourself using sutures, as I will describe for abdominal wounds and their suturing.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the wound has already detached from the bone and is hanging loose with no retention except a small sling, then cut it out.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicine and restore hard flesh to it where skin should be, and instruct the patient to nourish themselves with foods that are heavy or substantial in nature, such as heads of cabbage, cooked wheat until it is like porridge, and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find putrefaction in the skin and it is not adhering to the bone, then cut away all of the putrid flesh and cast it forth; afterwards treat the wound.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If there is an artery or a vein from which blood is flowing in these wounds and it cannot be stanched by medicine, then sew up over the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If you find that it has not been cut, then sever it with scissors or ligate it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the need arises when what we have said cannot be brought to bear, then cauterise it until the blood is stanched.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If these wounds are small and simple then their treatment is easy and light: so sprinkle this powder over them because it will set the wounds before the air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Recipe for flesh-coloured powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part frankincense, two parts dragon's blood and three parts unslaked lime; grind everything up a great deal and sift it; then fill the wound with it and bind it tightly so that it adheres well over it and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then squeeze it from above with pledgets and let it remain, not removing it until such time as the wound will not open up.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	Make sure that medicine is not removed from him unless he gets healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes chalk alone does that when you do not have frankincense at hand; and blood of the dragon also performs the same operation in many large wounds where it is appropriate to put it on them and squeeze them, being fresh wounds with their own blood which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	But if they have already been altered by air in some way, especially when it is summer time, then this powder will not be of use; so treat them with what we mentioned before, making sure to put digestive ointments on them or apply poultices made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until they start discharging pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with other remedies until they heal.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If there is a small fracture with the wound, then extract it using forceps; and I will tell you about treatment of fractures of the skull later on.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	On wounds to the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	But if there is a wound on the neck, then there is no difference between it and any other simple head injury regarding treatment.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if the nerve of the neck has already been cut then there is no hope; unless it is an artery, in which case treat it with something that causes extreme constriction such as zinebr and zegia along with similar substances.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Since they harm nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything cold on the wound at all: since the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most vital part; and let it be cured by medicines that are soft, such as lime washed with water that has been infused several times with oil, or with rose oil and tutia when it is also washed with sweet water: and the other mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	But if the wound is large, then apply stitches; or draw together its lips with thread.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if the wound is deep, or a cavity has formed in its lower part where pus has already gathered, then pierce it at the lowest point of that cavity.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If an artery has already been cut in the wound and its flow of blood is lost, then tie it off or burn it; and if need be, cauterize it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the windpipe has already been split or completely severed and the cartilages have been preserved, then bring together the lips of the skin with a stitch over the windpipe, without touching it; but rather, level it off, and restore its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments that have styptic and drying properties until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	But if the wound has left an impression in a bone, then probe it; and if there are fragments of bone in it, remove them all or as many as you can; but leave any that cannot be removed until the wound is rotten, and its discharge has separated from the bone and abated.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder I described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If there appears to be bone in the wound, and a fistula forms, then treat it with what was described in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Regarding wounds on spades.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is a stab wound from a spear or knife, and you see its depth, then consider the following.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If breath escapes from the wound when the patient gasps, then you know that the injury is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is recent with its blood still there, then do not apply powder or bind it tightly at first so that blood is not held back in the depth of the wound and returns to the heart and kills the patient; instead, place on it an attracting ointment and loosen it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If you do not have the ointment available, then place on the wound opening an old piece of cloth to absorb what comes out of it due to humidity; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what collects there runs off.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If three or more days have passed since the injury, and the patient has not had any convulsions, nor a bad heart tremor, nor tightness in their gasping breaths, and you see that his other symptoms are good, then know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Treat it with dressings and the rest of the treatment until it is cured.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If its healing is neglected, and it always opens up again, then know that a fistula has formed there.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Treat her therefore from her own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from an incision of a sword or knife and it's simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what preceded for stitching if it's large; or with powder if it's small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If however it has already made an impression on the bone and chipped off a piece from it: then examine the wound, and hurry to remove those pieces if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If however they are not separated, then leave them until the wound decays, for their extraction will be eased.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgement of the other accidental wounds in the remaining members as regards treatment is that same judgement we have said before.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	§ On wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestine, and their exitus.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture which happens to the belly is great, or middle-sized, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore from the great one sometimes an intestine exits, or a number of intestines exit.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why this happens is that their introduction and stitching is more violent and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	It follows therefore that their reduction is more difficult if you don't hurry with introducing them to their place immediately: for it swells up, opens and becomes enlarged: which makes its entrance difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	For this reason therefore the medium rupture is better than that of the disruptions: for with it the reduction of the intestine isn't difficult as it is in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that sewing veins can be done in four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common stitches are suitable for sewing the belly and all other bodily wounds; two other stitches are specifically used for other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more specific for sewing the belly; I will tell you about each with an explanation and clarification.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say, therefore, that when a wound is small and something protrudes from the intestine, making it difficult to restore, then this is one of two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the smallness of the tear, as I said; or because there is an inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When this is the case, you should warm it by submerging a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you could boil it in water with mallow, rushes, wheat spikes, and embrocation until the inflation subsides.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes, wine with astringent properties will do this; it is better than water alone at resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	Once you see the inflation has resolved, moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by this means its entry is eased with something small.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however its entry is blocked after this treatment, then find the small tear with the instrument they use to cut haemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	The first cure is better when prepared than cutting; there is no need to force the cutting once you have lost the tool.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	One part of it is curved, sharp, and the other part is not sharp, and its pointed end should not be as fine as a spatula, rather it should be slightly blunter; and that is what resembles lime, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	Thus when the wound is enlarged and it enters the intestine, then one ought to reduce it back into its own place according to its natural form if that is possible over it; for this is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	But when the rupture is wide in the lower part of the belly: then you ought to have the sick person lie on their back and place their legs higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place their head and chest higher than their lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your attention and consideration always on this: that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus you ought to administer this for large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	For small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then ensure that there is present a pious attendant between your hands who holds the entire rupture with their hand and draws its lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then have someone who follows the suture clean off something after something from it: and this is the way of a single common suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it happens that you take a needle or the number of needles according to the size of the wound's width.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then remove from the end of the wound a quantity equal to the ring finger, that is, [the length of] the physician's [ring] finger; and fix the needle with one end inside it, in such a way as you introduce into it the thread at both ends of the skin along with both ends of the sifac that lies underneath the skin, until you make it penetrate from the other side: and you have now brought together the two ends of the skin and the two ends of the sifac; and there are four orders [of stitching].
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then bind with double thread around the needle several times from both sides at once, until the two lips of the wound are joined together decorously.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then remove the thickness of another finger as well, and fix into these [wounds] another needle; afterwards straighten it with thread, just as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore you do not stop doing this with as many needles as are needed, until you have completed the binding of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And [the needles] should be of medium thickness between thick and thin; for thin needles very quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin. Because of this, it is necessary that they have a medium thickness and thinness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed at both ends of the skin close by: so that flesh is not cut quickly and the wound opened up before its healing, nor are they stretched with the stitching until the wound is prevented from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient in their sleep; and put on them small pads made from cloth on every side, which hold the ends of the needles; and leave [the pads] until you know that the wound has now healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	This particular type of suturing with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because one needle or two, or about that number of them is sufficient for the suturing of these.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second type of suture is common, such that you bring together with the suture four ends; two ends of skin and two ends of fascia in place of one, with a needle on which there is thread wound evenly in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced with the needle these four ends, bring back the needle from that side where you began them, so that the drawn thread may fall on the upper part of the wound; and let the suture be like the stitch used in sewing cloths together, putting a thickness equal to the little finger between every suture.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This suture is known to men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I myself sutured the wound of a man who had been wounded with a knife in his belly; there was a gash over one palm's width and about two palms' length of intestine had come out from the middle of the gut, and there was a disruption in the center of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I therefore brought it back after his gut had lain outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound therefore healed within about fifteen days; and I treated him, and he was cured: and he lived after that for many years, conducting his affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And by a miracle it was, that I did not treat him with any ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no ointment or anything medicinal could be found.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore dressed the wound twice a day with an old poultice, and I attended to its washing with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will speak of two types of stitches that are particularly suited for this, following the description in the text.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	This means that you should start with an acute stitch by inserting the needle from the outside to the inside.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle has penetrated through the skin and is entering the flesh according to the length and width of the entire body: let one end come out on the side from which you inserted the needle, and make the other end penetrate from the inside towards the outside at the other end at merach.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	Once you have made it penetrate, then make the other end of this stitch penetrate from the outside to the inside at this same merach end; and let the sifac end that is on this side go through, and make the needle go into the other end from the inside towards the outside: and make your penetration as you do with the one going into the sifac merach end until it has penetrated right through.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then start again from this same side and pick up the thread with the end that is at sifac on the other side, then draw out the needle from the skin through which it has passed.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then bring it back to that skin and pick up the thread with the sifac end which is on the other side along with this mirach end; then draw out the needle from the skin through which it came, doing so once after another: and do so alternately until you have done all of them in an alternating fashion according to this pattern.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	The essence of this stitch is that you should do your stitches like those used for tanning hides or pelts so that they are sewn with one end of the thread coming out alternately on one side and then the other side of the skin's edge: and leave it in an alternating fashion from each side until you have completed them all.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of stitch, as described by Galen.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	His speech is narrated as if he were comparing it to the way some doctors do it, so that they bring together every part of the wound according to its corresponding natural shape: and they attach one end of sifac to another end, and one end of mirach to another.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And it is done as I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You must pierce the needle into the end of mirach nearest you from the outer side, and make it pass through to the inner one on its own; and leave the two ends of sifac free.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle around, and make it pass from the outer side to the inner one through the two ends of sifac, that is on either side.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both around, and make them pass through from the inner to the outer side into the other two ends of mirach, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of stitching is better than the common simple stitch, and it is the stitch whose description has just been given.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This then is Galen's teaching also.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some have said...
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The belly is stitched with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is to pass the same thread through both of them; and beginning with the insertion of the needle from that which is nearest you, make it go right through to the other side according to the stitches on those who have equal hides.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you must know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly; then its stitch is more difficult than those of other parts of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of a wound's treatment is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	Which is, because when you acquire a fresh wound with its blood, before it is altered by the air; and you cleanse, dry and prepare it; then place it over incarnant powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already altered the wound, then apply over it some ointments that are at hand to you until they form pus; and the filaments fall out, scabs form, and healing occurs.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it like the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	However, if you do not have the medicines at hand, then apply over it immediately an old piece of cloth once it begins to discharge pus; and change it twice a day as I taught you until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not require another medicine in many cases when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you fear that the wound may affect the major limbs by its injury, then you should immerse soft wool in tepid warm oil or in rose oil; and place it around the places between the groins and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If the patient feels pain or colic, or putrefaction of the intestines (for this often happens), then you should administer an enema to them with astringent wine, black and tepid; especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine and is about to break through into his abdomen.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And note that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal; and what comes from the delicate parts is more difficult to treat.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The part of the intestine known as the jejunum does not heal at all from a wound that occurs in it; this is because of its plethora of veins and their large size, as well as the fineness of its tissue and its proximity to nerve fibers.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If the hernia that proceeds from the wound is fresh and you pursue it, bring it back according to your method of reduction as you would reduce intestines uniformly.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	However, if time has passed and it already has turned green or black, then you must tie it with thread above the spot where it has darkened so that no blood flows from it.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	There are veins and arteries in a hernia.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Next make an incision in what is beyond that ligament and leave the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it; this will alleviate the drawing upon yourself when extracting the hernia and remove its chance to discharge puss from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	§ A reminder of the wound that occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When there is a rupture of the intestine and it is small, then it can be restored in some people; for I have seen one who was wounded in his belly by being struck with a lance, and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and an old wound: and it became a fistula, and there came out from him evacuations and wind.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	So I applied a remedy until I had no confidence in its healing; nor did I cease probing it until it was healed and the spot consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the spot now consolidated, I feared over the patient that there would happen to him an evil accident in his belly; and this evil event did not befall him.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	He remained in good health, eating and drinking, having sex, going to the bathhouse, and exercising regularly.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimental surgeons have said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be sutured in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And you must take large-headed ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound and place one ant with its mouth open on top of the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it bites down on them and clamps its mouth shut, cut off its head because it sticks and will not release.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant next to the first one, and keep doing this with an ant after every ant according to the size of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then stitch it up yourself, and let the wound heal.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For the ant heads remain attached to the intestine until it is healed, and there is no harm done whatsoever to the patient.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is now possible to suture the intestine with a fine thread as well; this has been cleaned from the gut of an animal and attached to the needle once it has been inserted.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And you must take one end of this thread from the gut, and strip off all its flesh.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then bind to its end a fine linen thread that has been wound around it.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert this thread into the needle, and use it to suture the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then bring it yourself back to the rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know, a wound that is large, wide, especially if it is on one of the thinner intestines: then there is no skill but precision, and its healing is absolutely not possible.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Regarding the cure for Zuchemen and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that any wound or abscess when it becomes old and ancient, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal, and emits pus constantly, and is not separated: then universally it is called a fistula on whichever limb it may be found, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	A fistula is truly a filtered knot, hard, white; with which there is no pain, it has the shape of a bird's feather: and on account of that some call it Risati, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And at certain times it is moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture gets separated during some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is large in quantity and small; it is thick and thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I already mentioned in the division when I said wounds that any ulcer which does not heal and flesh is not born on it, it is only because of one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is either due to a lack of blood in the body; or because of its malignancy; or because there is hard flesh between it and its lips, preventing the birth of flesh; or because it has too much dirt and impurity; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine used for treating it is unsuitable; or because the corruption falling in the region is a type of pestilence, or due to some property of the region, as happens at Caesaraugusta: where diseases are difficult to digest, and healing of abscesses is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone in it, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And now I have shown you all these causes and signs of the conditions, and their treatments along with medicines in each division; and here it is necessary that I make you aware of the treatment of fistulas and zukens, which are done by way of operative procedure with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You should be aware that fistulas occur in all body parts.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For among them are fistulas that reach major veins and arteries or nerves or sinuses; or to the intestine, bladder, ribs, or some of the spinal vertebrae, or to a complex joint such as those found in the hand or foot; and from these are fistulae that lead close to an important organ and its surroundings.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Thus, of these fistulas there is one that is difficult to heal and does not take treatment; working with it is labour and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	But if there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places that I mentioned and you hope and trust in its treatment and wish to learn it, then take a probe made of brass or iron, if the fistula runs straight, and explore with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	However, if there is curvature to the fistula, then investigate it with a fine lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Since the soft body of lead adapts and curves around bends.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has multiple openings, it is not possible for you to trace over it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, wash out one of the openings from among its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you wash it will run towards other openings and flow from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Next, carefully inquire as to how you can determine if there is a bone or nerve and whether the fistula's cavity is distant or near; or if it is a single fistula with many openings that covers all of this area, using your utmost strength: by questioning the patient, feeling for pain at the site when compressed by your hand, and similar signs and causes from the symptoms.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you have thus stood at the true station, then proceed to treatment with confidence: and consider then, if the fistula is a nearby one that is apparent or in a safe place far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the places I mentioned to you: then cut the fistula as previously described in my account, remove what is in it of filtrate and corrupted flesh, which arises at its opening from flesh, membrane, or similar things: and treat it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is of great depth and straight, you must cut it as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	After that, apply bandages wrapped in sharp medicines: and introduce them to the fistula's cavity which you grasped with your iron tool several times until the sharp medicine erodes all that remains in the fistula's cavity from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal with that treatment, then cauterize it as we described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If the cause of the fistula is a bone, and you ascertain this, then question it and cut it as I told you: if nothing prevents you from a vein, nerve or main limb as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If you detect a bone and there is any sign of decay or blackening within it, then scrape it until all the decay is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with something that embodies it, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	But if it does not heal and emits pus as before, then know that you have not reached the total eradication of decay.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Detect it again over the same place, and make its removal perfect, and cleanse it with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it heals, then that is good; but if not, know that the decay lies deep within the body where you have not reached it.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	It is therefore beyond your skill unless you let nature take its course.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the decayed bone is small and it is possible for you to do so, extract it with fine forceps that are suited to it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	But if there are many bones, then make your extraction of them all perfect, and do not leave any behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If anything from the humours opposes you, and there is no fear or mistake in opening them up: then open up those humours and flesh if they are present there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then place on the wound something that will cause them to decay; and leave it until what is around those bones of flesh and humours has decayed away.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And bind tightly the incision you have made during your procedure.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	In my opinion, place on top of it, if you fear it, a poultice of sulphur pounded with oil and soaked; or a poultice steeped in Egyptian ointment, or any of the violet-based ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those moistures rot, and the bones are separated from them, the removal of theirs will be soothed, and theirs drawn in.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if it is one large bone, like the leg or hip bone, and what has become of it is a large part; then scrape it with your knife until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if what has become of it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached into the marrow of the bone, then it must be sawn through and cut all the way to where the corruption has reached; then treat it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you this case which happened to a man in his leg; that you may place it as an example and help for your procedure.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man aged about thirty years old, who had pain in his leg from something which happened inside him; until the matter came to his leg and it became ulcerated with a large ulcer; and there was no external cause for this.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So time passed with him in error of the doctors until the ulcer opened up and many matters came out with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	The treatment was postponed until the leg had developed a fistula and multiple openings formed on it, all of which discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	For about two years a multitude of physicians treated him but there was no expert in the art of surgery among them until I was called upon and saw his leg as well as the discharge flowing out from those openings: moreover, by now the whole body of that man had wasted away and his complexion was yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	So I inserted a probe into one of the openings and it reached right down to the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings and found that they communicated with each other on every side of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Therefore I made an incision and cut away the tissue around one of those openings until I exposed a piece of bone which I found was destroyed: it had been corroded, discolored, turned rotten, and perforated right through to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I accordingly sawed off that piece of bone which had been exposed to me and prepared it from the rotten bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I judged that there was nothing wrong with the bone other than that part which had been damaged by my cutting away and sawing off.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And now I have already removed it (that is, the diseased bone).
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied healing medicines to the wound for a long time until it was healed.
Et non est consolidatum.	And yet still it has not been healed (that is, the wound).
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed again and found some more bone over the place where my first probe had exposed the bone; that too was diseased, so I cut it away as well.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted his restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I therefore tried again on it, and I did not cease cutting the bone in particular places, and attempting to restore it; and it was still not restored until I had cut out about a span of the bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I healed it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly, and was cured; and this repetition of the operation and incision would not have been necessary, except due to the condition of the patient's weakness, and his lack of endurance, and my fear over him regarding death: for he suffered in all hours from excess evacuation bad fainting.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was therefore cured completely; and hard flesh was born in the place of the bone, and good order was made in his body, and his strength returned to him; and he resumed his usual condition: and no damage whatsoever was done to him by walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if a protruding bone in the body has already been broken; then it is necessary that you saw it, in this way: and that is, take a ligament, and bind it to the end of the protruding bone; and instruct someone who will stretch it upwards; and place another woollen ligament on top of the first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it on top of the flesh that is above the bone; and extend its end so you can pull the flesh downwards; and you cover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw, so as not to harm the flesh with the saw.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place some wood or board under the lower bone somewhat off-centre; for when you do this, it is not prevented from cutting the diseased flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that a lock be placed over the affected area for some time, so as to prevent the corruption of the bone cavity; and not appear on its own accord by sensation, and thus force another to use their lock instead.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and not protruding, but instead continues its part with another part; and the corruption is either within or around it; then remove all flesh from every one of these parts.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the lower wooden block.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterward, saw it from the first part where there is corruption until it continues onto the other side; and let the lock be of length slightly beyond the extent of the corruption, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is at a joint, cut that corrupted join, and saw the bone where it continues onto another part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if the corruption is within two joins continuing onto each other, then there is no remedy for it but to scrape.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is within the palm of the hand or sole of the foot, then this case is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary that you enquire as to the nature of the corruption as it presents itself.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And you must scrape it and clean the wound to any extent possible for you; with whatever remedy is available to you; provided that there be no contraindication from Vein or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And be aware that there are many saws and knives to cut these bones; according to their position in the body and the preparation required of them; as well as their thickness and thinness, length and smallness, hardness and rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary that you prepare every kind of surgical instrument suitable for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations indicate to you the type of instrument required, which you need when you have a lengthy study period.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the methods of this art is a witness to your understanding of illnesses; for then you will find by yourself that which suits him from among the instruments for every illness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am establishing for you at the end of this chapter a list of instruments which you set as examples over those on which you operate and as a test by which to experiment with others.
Forma Serrae.	Form of the Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of the other saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This depiction of the form of the saw is off-centre.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper frame be made of iron, its blade of steel; and its handle of boxwood, with a pyramidal tip which is off-centre.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Form of the scissors for uniting [tissues].
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of these scissors be formed according to the shape of a star-headed nail; and its tips be shaped like those of the *elischetfeg*.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable unless the tips of the scissors are sharpened with it when they become dull or a large bone needs to be cut.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Form of the larger scissors.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Form of the medium-sized scissors.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the broad snare.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Form of a concave snare.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of the other slender snare.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Form of the other curved snare with pointed ends.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of the paired snares, slender at the handles.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Form of the snare with which bones may be cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Form also of the large snare.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a saw; its end is like the teeth of a saw; it appears in many places on account of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the snare that is suitable for breaking through perforated bone.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular; it has sharp points.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made of Indian steel.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise it is necessary that all of the things we have described be made from snares (rasoria), and knives (incisorium) and saws (serra).
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the cutting off of limbs, and trepanning bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	Limbs putrefy either from an external or internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	Therefore when you have treated that corruption with medicinal cure and it does not respond to the treatment; and you see the corruption spreading into the limb in such manner that it is not repelled by anything: then it is necessary that you amputate that limb up until where the spread of the corruption follows, so that the patient may escape death or some more serious malady through loss of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	The sign that this has occurred is when the limb turns black and is considered burnt by fire or undergoes putrefaction after turning black; until that rot is cut away as far as the bone which follows that limb, and spreads throughout the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, the treatment should be with an incision of it, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the stings or bites of certain venomous creatures such as the marine scorpion, viper, rutella, and similar animals.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption or sting is at the tip of the finger, then cut off the finger and do not give any space to the corruption, so that it does not spread further into the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it occurs in the hand, then cut it off from the wrist and do not give any space to the corruption until it reaches the elbow of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades further, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption passes through and you see it around the elbow, then for that patient there is death.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And apart from that in terms of treatment, it's the amount of strength which matters.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do the same with the foot when corruption invades a toe; then cut it off at one of its joints. And if it reaches the instep of the foot, then amputate the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it climbs up to the knee, then cut off the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If however the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill left other than to give up and leave the patient to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	The method for cutting a limb or sealing it is to tighten the ligament below where you want to cut; and then tighten another ligament above that spot.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And the attendant should stretch one ligament downwards; and the attendant should stretch another ligament upwards, towards the top.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a broad knife, until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it may be cut or sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	You should place a piece of linen cloth on all sides so that the knife does not touch the healthy area; otherwise, an additional injury may occur in the weakened spot and pus will form.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If there is internal bleeding as you operate, then quickly cauterize the spot; or place some blood-stanching powders on it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament, and take care of it until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you that this same accident happened to a man on his foot.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	Which was because his foot turned black with a burn that looked like it had been set alight by fire; and the corruption first started on his toe before spreading to his entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	The man therefore treated himself after he saw the corruption take hold of his limb with great pain and burning; it started at the join and he healed up.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	After a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred to him on his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I tried to treat the excess with what I had placed on his hand from medicines after cleansing his body; however, the excess was not reabsorbed and began to spread to another finger until decay set in on his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He thus called for me to amputate his hand; I refused, hoping that it would be reabsorbed and fearing death for him even if I were to perform the amputation on his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the strength of the man was above the injury.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he lost hope in me, he returned to his land; and by the time it reached me that he had hurried there and cut off his entire hand, I found him healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	I have not presented this account except to offer help for those who suffer from this kind of illness; and also as a sign by which it may be recognized, so that one can proceed accordingly.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the treatment of worms, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When a pus-filled swelling occurs on certain fleshy parts of the body and the swelling continues to spread until it collects some pus; then it bursts or is pierced, and whatever was inside leaks out, leaving behind an empty space like that of a pot, while the skin above remains like cloth that has been worn thin: if this does not reach its last stage in decay nor cause damage to bone, nerve or ligament, it merits being called a Worm; but not a Fistula. However, when the process continues until the corruption penetrates one of these parts, then it is properly called either a Fistula or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	The cure for it is to cut the entire skin as it peels off and especially when it becomes thin like cloth; you can be confident that it will not stick back into place because of its degeneration.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	However, if you expect the skin to adhere and it doesn't lead to that ultimate deterioration; and if there is a thickening of flesh in the skin, then treat this with an enema and consider the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	If it is large and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor, then enema it with Egyptian medicine, which consists equally of vinegar, oil, and ziniar, combined in a vase; boil over fire until the medicine turns red and becomes as thick as honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Take as much of it as you need; dissolve it with water and honey and enema the sinus with this solution, then close off the opening and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with pressure; do this for as many days as needed until the sinus is cleansed and the stench removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	Sometimes it can be enema'd with ash water if this medicine is not available; in that case use the ashes of grape-wood or oak-wood and sprinkle them over the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then mix it and enema with it until you're confident that the sinus has been cleaned out.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or ash water, then enema them with just water and honey, to which you should also add some powdered ziniar.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or apply the enema itself mixed with honey and wine since it is a property of honey to cleanse and wash away, and the wine makes the bowel adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this a few times, and are confident that the bowel's corruption has been removed, then apply an enema with what makes flesh grow there.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And you may take some of the dyafinicon plaster; dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or apply an enema with certain medicines and other ointments whose properties I have written about in my treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	But if the bowel's orifice is narrow and cannot admit the enema pipe, then dilate it slightly with an iron instrument; or apply to it a linen cloth wrapped around an Egyptian ointment, or a royal ointment, until it has been enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then draw together its lips with a suture; and leave such an extent of it as will admit an enema without extension.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if its orifice from which the pus flows is elevated upwards, then cut it lower down where the pus oozes out so that it will flow downwards; for when pus is confined deep within a bowel, it prevents flesh from forming there.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But if you cannot cut the bowel as low down around it as you wish, then try to prepare the member in such a way that the pus may flow from it with ease as is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to ensure that no pus remains in it at all; and take consolidating medicines which are applied to a wound, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such quantity that it covers the entire breast.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with scissors along a straight line from the nipple hole, slightly larger than the breast opening.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread a soft ointment on another cloth, according to the size of the hole; and place it over itself in a distant position from the breast opening, so as to alleviate the discharge of pus from it: and do not remove the large cloth unless after some days at once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	Now the one which is over the breast opening, that is the one you remove every hour, so as to drain what accumulates in it of pus: and so that you may know if that which flows from it matter is abundant or scarce; thick or thin.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this again consider the place of the breast itself, if its owner feels pain there, or not; and whether there is inflammation, or no inflammation.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your treatment is prolonged like this, and you see the matter which comes out over the breast opening, then you know that the breast has already adhered, or approaches adhesion: then therefore release it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you release the wound, then change the other cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if a thin matter comes out of the breast after a long time, then do not despair about its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since there are men who delay flesh production in their wounds, and among them are those who act contrary to it.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if unabsorbed pus comes out of the breast after many days, then you know that the breast does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolonged, then add to the drying medicines, but let the physicians ensure that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their virtue, such as dyaphinicon ointment when an excess of zegi is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And for the final treatment, take some dyaphinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, then rub it on old wine equal in quantity to the substance of the ointment.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix the two together and use them.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And you may do something similar to this procedure when dyaphinicon ointment is not available; instead use honey, which you should boil until it thickens, and then use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, aloe, and olibanum; pound all three together, then powder them over honey while it is still on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then spread a cloth over it and bind it to the sinus; spread over this the honey that you boiled until thick, and powder spices over it before placing another cloth on top and binding them together.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	At times, long aristolochia, roots of celestial lily (that is, saffron), comfrey root flour and centaurea may also be administered.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use these ingredients either individually or combined; pound them together and sieve before powdering over the honey I previously described, then use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the condition of the sinus persists and does not heal with this treatment, then know that there is some deep-seated corruption; or it may have already affected bones, other hard tissues, or ligaments; in such cases treat it according to the fistula treatments I outlined previously.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	The treatment for panaritium and an abraded nail involves incision or amputation of the finger.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 81.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A panaritium is an abscess that forms under the nail of the thumb or big toe, although it may also appear on other digits.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When left untreated and neglected for too long, the abscess can become inflamed with heat or become infected, discharging pus until it erodes the nail root; it may destroy the entire nail bed entirely, spreading to the bone, causing foul odours; the digit's extremity becomes swollen and discoloured.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	Therefore, when your treatment does not help as described above, it is necessary to cut away with a knife all that remains of the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Afterwards, cauterise the wound.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Indeed, hot-iron cauterisation is very beneficial.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	However, if the bone is sound and both nail and nail bed are healthy but empty nail appendages now push flesh towards the interior and begin to pierce it, causing harm; then you must place a slender probe beneath that nail corner which pricks the flesh and push back on it; cut away this flesh with ease and put on what remains of corrosive cauterising salves until all is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Afterwards treat it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If the infection has already reached the bone, it is necessary to cut away and remove this bone; for it will never heal as long as the corrupted bone remains.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see decay and deterioration spreading into the finger, then cut it off at one of the joints, according to what has been previously mentioned.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If the nail is damaged by scraping or knocking, and there is severe pain in it, then you should first bleed the patient with a lancet.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut away the nail with a sharp spatulum, cutting it transversely from top to bottom.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful not to cut through into the flesh that lies underneath the nail, for you will cause a severe pain to happen to the patient, and it will lead to an addition of flesh growing there.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the place with something that soothes pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	However, the added finger that grows on some people's hands may be all flesh; and there may be bones in it sometimes, or a nail may grow with it; and some of them are born at the root of the joint, while others start growing from one of the knuckles of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	The one which grows from the knuckle of a finger does not move; and the one that is born at the root of the joint may or may not be able to move it.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	The one which is all flesh among them is easy to cut off.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	This means you should cut it at its root with a broad spatulum.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	The treatment of the one whose growth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Refrain from making an incision on it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	However, if one is born with it on the tip of the finger near the last joint, then you should first cut its flesh with a round incision until you reach the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw through the bone using one of those saws suitable for this purpose.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	After that, take care of it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	However, the condition which occurs in fingers due to being close together happens often either from birth, i.e., they are born like that, or from healing of a wound, or burning by fire and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut away the joining flesh until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them linen cloths or pieces of cloth soaked in rose oil so that they do not join together quickly and separate the fingers; or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the affected area has healed as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if such a condition occurs in some fingers with the palm of the hand then cut away the joined flesh according to what is prepared and suits the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	On the surgical correction of deformity.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are twisted veins filled with a lot of melancholic waste which appear in many body parts and their end point is often the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk long distances or do heavy labour.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	It is therefore necessary that one administers strong beating of the body to expel the black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then the leech should take care of the patient's basilica.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these with iron, however, is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they should be cut open, and black blood extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein should be raised up, and removed in its entirety.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	Its incision is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Scrape the leg first with warm water until the thick, dirty blood is loosened.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of their hip to the lower part of the knee with a cloth.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein at one place or two, or three places, with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise it up, that is to say extract the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and you must have the patient's leech at first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail down to below: until you see a quantity of blood exiting that is sufficient and which the patient's strength can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards bind this up; and order him to abstain from foods which produce black bile; and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full of it, as long as it does not harm the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	Its elevation is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Scrape the patient's leg if there is much hair on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then immerse him in a bath; or scrape it with your hand on the patient's leg with warm water until he turns red and the veins fill up; or make him exercise vigorously if there is no bath present for him, until his limb becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then make an incision through the skin along the length of the vein: either at its lowest point near the knee or on its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then lift the skin with hooks and scrape out the vein from all sides until it appears to the senses; when you see that it is red and darkening.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it has receded from the skin, you will see that it is white like a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce a rod under it until when you lift it up, it comes out of the skin; hang it with a blunt hook gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then make another incision near that incision, three fingers away.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift it up with rods as you did before, and hang it with another hook just as you did initially.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then make another incision or several incisions if required.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift it up, and make an incision at the last part near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then extract it to the incision above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you extract it from the upper incision or all higher incisions when it comes out completely; then cut it open.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not obey you and rise up for extraction; then introduce a needle with strong thread twice through, and tie it before extracting or put a rod under it again; roll your hand in all directions until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, lest it be cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes difficult for you to raise it greatly, and it enters the patient from that harm.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	So when you have extracted it all: then place over the wound a piece of wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil; and treat it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	But if the artery is twisted, having a turn to the sides, and it is not as we have said straight: then you must cut over it on every side of its twist, and the places of its turn.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then lift it with hooks until you have raised it all; and beware near your cut over it that you do not cut the vein or wound it; for it will be difficult for you to raise or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The incident in which the artery is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of a blind wound.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have a curvature like other wounds, nor is it of sharp point so as not to wound the vein; and it has a thick bend, gentle: for if it were thin, it would cut the vein with its thinness; rather let there be superfluous thickness to it, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the leg vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs; and in dry, hot lands of little tenderness, that is, where neither grass nor tree are born.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it generates in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	Indeed its generation is from the putrefaction which happens beneath the skin, just as it happens inside the bodies of snakes and roundworms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	A sign of the beginning of this condition is a severe inflammation that occurs in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then cauterize the area.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to exit from that place of cauterization, like it is a root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When its end appears, you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing from one to two drachmas, and tie that in place; then leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever anything emerges from it to the outside, wrap that in lead and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	But if it extends for too long, cut off that part and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it away entirely until all of it has emerged.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it away too soon, it will contract and reenter the flesh; this can cause an abscess, or even decay of the flesh around that place to a nasty ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it should be handled gently and extracted gradually until all of its length is out; in some men, this vein may measure as much as five to ten palms.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	He has now reached a point where he exited the man through twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it happens to you during your treatment time: then insert a rod into its hole and perforate it with a long hollow needle until all the material inside is evacuated; and apply decay-causing medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle joint or on the foot itself; and it happens to have multiple openings, with a branch exiting from each opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore treat it as we have said in the section above, and along with what has been mentioned before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	On cutting open on worms generated under the skin, which is called asinine disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called asinine disease in our country; therefore, because it often happens to donkeys and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it enters the entire body, going up and down; and it is felt by the person when it moves from limb to limb until it bursts wherever it bursts through the skin, and exits.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	Its generation is from the decay of certain fluids.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As happens with worms and snakes, that is, earthworms, and pinworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared for its harmfulness.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	When he goes into the body and is lifted up to the head, and reaches a certain place, then perhaps he opens it up, comes out, and destroys the eye; this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	Thus when you want to treat him and take it out, this does not happen unless during his walking around and the appearance of its symptoms to [your] senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore you must bind what is above him and what is beneath with a strong ligamentary constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut just above it and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	But if [the stone] is buried within the flesh and you do not find it, then place a hot iron on that spot until [the patient] dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater danger to be feared is its corruption, by which it destroys the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see that it has already reached the head near to the eye, then bind underneath it a good strap across the eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut just above it and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And the patient must use cleansing of his body with medicines that dissolve evil foul humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And he should avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the cutting [treatment] of Nakir's illness.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This illness is called Nakir in our land, and it is a pain that occurs in some members; then it shifts from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have indeed seen it, just as I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to an ailing woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And I found that her arm was swollen, and I saw a small enlargement in the vein of the biceps.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained for an hour, I saw one swelling advance with its feelers, moving like a worm, climbing to her shoulder faster than can be believed: so that it was like live silver, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	So the pain receded from that spot, and became fixed in her shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for an hour, and it ran into the rest of her body until it reached her other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her entire body, just as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	So I marveled at the speed of its transformation from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I myself had never before seen this illness with my own eyes in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many whose pain shifts from limb to limb; and I had not witnessed it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it to be anything other than what it is because the woman was one of those from dry villages whose veins are easily detected; thus that shift in sensation appears windy.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that this reasoning does not appear to apply to those who are lush and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you wish to cure it and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to your eye as we said before, then compress above and below it quickly: and cut above it until the trapped wind escapes: and cauterize the area.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If however you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with body shaking, and with what expels wind, and causes it to belch foul smelling pills, and pills made of serapin, and similar.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their type, and the locations within the body where they fall.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their differences are as follows: for among them there are those with large heads and small ones: concave and convex.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And some have three edges.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them, there are those with barbs.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And some have feathers.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those according to the limbs within which they fall are of two kinds.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For the limbs are either among those that are concave members such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder and similar.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When it falls into any of these limbs and you see the signs of death I describe below, then you must avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death will follow that person in whom it is in many cases.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then extract it and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when an arrow strikes the brain and penetrates the bone, and emerges from the soft part that is above the brain, these are the signs: severe headaches occur, and also scotomata, vertigo, redness of eyes, swelling, reddening of tongue, spasms, confusion, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood emerges from the nostrils or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is impaired, and the voice becomes hoarse.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	From the place of the wound, white moisture like pus emerges.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there is an exit from it similar to the moistness of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it has not emerged.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow having struck the heart are that it is close to the left nipple, and he feels with it as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the movement of the arrow is similar to the pulse; and black blood runs out from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	After that follows extreme coldness, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Therefore you should know that death is undoubtedly near.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	The signs of an arrow having struck the lung are that blood emerges from the wound in a frothy manner; and the veins which follow around the neck become inflamed, and the colour of the patient changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	He expires with a great, deep breath and seeks to draw in cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow strikes the membrane that is in the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and there will be great panting with severe pain, accompanied by a sigh; and all the limbs of the shoulders will move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps some undigested food will exit from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow strikes the belly and pierces it, then perhaps some feces will exit from the wound, or a fragment of the bowl, or an intestine that is already ruptured.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope for its cure nor for extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine exits from it, and something from within proceeds to the exterior, and the pain is more severe in the lower region, then know that this is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining body parts, such as the face, neck, throat, jawbone, aid, spine, shoulder blade, hip, leg, and similar members, are healed according to many procedures when the arrow has not struck an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I have seen these very arrows so that you may know by them regarding your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is to say, an arrow struck a man's tear duct at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	So I extracted it myself from the other side, below the ear fat; and he was healed, and there was no harm done to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	I extracted another arrow from the eye of a Jew; it had fallen into the fat under his lower eyelid and was already obscured. I only found its tiny tip, which adhered to its wooden shaft, and this was a large arrow used by Turkish archers with a blunt iron head without any barbs.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was healed so no evil accident befell his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arab arrow with barbs.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I cut open the throat from both sides and the arrow was already submerged there.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I handled it carefully until I extracted it; the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	I extracted another arrow from the belly of a man which had fallen there; we thought he would die because of it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed without his condition changing in any way, I cut over the arrow and contrived a plan to remove it; he was healed and no evil accident befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	I saw a man whose back had been wounded by an arrow; the wound had healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	Seven years later, the arrow emerged from his hip joint.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	I saw a woman who had an arrow in her belly; the wound had healed over it and the arrow remained inside her body without changing anything about her condition. The woman did not find any harm to herself through her normal bodily functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	I saw another man who had an arrow shot into his face; the wound had healed but remained, causing him little pain; there were many similar cases to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from the nose of a man who was one of the king's lords; it had gone into his nose and had started to turn towards the right side somewhat; the whole arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called to treat him three days after he got hit with the arrow.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	Thus, I found the wound of the arrow to be very tight-fitting.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I therefore examined it with a thin probe, and did not feel the arrow; for he himself found the point of entry and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that this was caused by the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	So I plastered the place with a plaster possessing both drawing and digesting powers, trusting that the spot would form an abscess so that I could cut over it; but this did not occur to indicate whether or no the arrow had gone into the skull.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I kept plastering him for many days; but nothing happened and the wound had healed in the meantime; so he remained weak from the extraction to this day because of that event until one day he felt an arrow inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me about it.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	Therefore I placed a sharp corrosive medicine on the wound for many days until it opened; and when I probed with a probe, I felt an extremely thin end of the arrow which was stuck to some wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added the sharp medicine to open up the wound until we visibly saw the tip of the arrow; and it took about four months with him for this to happen.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound was enlarged and it was possible to insert the forceps into it, and move them without yielding an exit: I did not cease from applying a scalpel and devising methods with instruments until one day I began on it with forceps that were suitably made, according to which their form will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed doctors judge that cartilage of the nose is not restorable.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated and he healed with complete health: nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the nature of extracting certain arrows: so that you may have this as a rule and sign over what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not covered with the narration: nor does the book cover it, and a prudent craftsman compares little to much: and what is present to what is absent: and finds new methods, and new instruments from foreign matters of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say then, that arrows do not exit from the limbs in which they are fixed except by two methods.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction out of the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by contraries of the other parts.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which exits from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding through fleshy tissue; and it is drawn out, and exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not yield to removal from the time when it strikes; then you should leave it alone for several days until the flesh surrounding it becomes putrid; and its drawing out and exit will be eased.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And likewise if it lodges in bone and does not yield to your removal attempts; then leave it alone for several days as well; and repeat the drawing out and movement each day until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it still does not yield to your removal attempts after those days then you must bore around the arrow on all sides within the bone itself with a fine trepan until the arrows are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it out, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is lodged in the skull bone and has already penetrated one of the ventricles of the brain; and some of those symptoms which I mentioned become apparent then refrain from drawing out the arrow, and leave it until it becomes calm after several days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the Sifach (an internal organ), then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not lodged except only within the substance of a bone; and it has not penetrated as far as the Sifach; yet he remains unwell for several days, and none of those symptoms occurs to him: then make an effort in drawing out that arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is lodged very firmly and does not yield to your drawing attempts then apply the trephine around the arrow as I described earlier; then treat that place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrow is already hidden within the body and concealed from detection by the senses, you must then seek it out with a probe.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you sense it, then draw it out with certain instruments suitable for the extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot proceed with the extraction due to the narrowing of the wound and the arrow's depth, and if there is no bone or nerve present near it, then wait until its extraction becomes possible by enlarging the wound.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If there are barbs attached to it that can be grasped, then free the flesh stuck around them from all sides with any tool available for the purpose; and if you cannot achieve their release due to embeddedness of the flesh in the barbs or contortion of the barbs, wait until the wound becomes enlarged enough for its extraction.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	As you proceed with the arrow's extraction from any location it is in, use hand contortion and forceps to pull on all sides until its emergence; do so with utmost care lest the arrow be broken or its extraction made more difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot proceed with its extraction within one hour, then abandon it for a few days until the flesh around it becomes rotten.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat the extraction process; for it becomes easier by then due to rotting of the flesh around it. If you face difficulty with blood flow during this process, apply the method described in its dedicated chapter earlier on in this book. And be mindful of your skills so as not to damage veins or nerves or tendons in the body.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	Apply any method possible to achieve its extraction; and let it be done with ease and calmness or slowness and firmness as I described earlier to you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	You must make sure that when you remove the arrow, the patient is positioned according to the figure, just as they were at the time of impact by the arrow itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Since it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If you cannot do that, then use one of the figures which is possible for you.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	An arrow that emerges from the opposite side of the other part, or has already penetrated somewhat outwards: if the tip of the arrow causes a swelling on the upper surface of the skin nearby and you see it protruding, cut over it; let your incision be according to the length which will permit forceps to grasp its end.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it out, for by then the arrow is easily removed.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is retained inside the bone, then turn your hand according to its curvature until you feel the arrow pushing against the bone and enlarging itself; afterwards pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not, leave it alone for several days; afterwards try again until you remove it.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If there is any wooden part of the arrow still inside it, then push that forward with it as well.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the wooden part has broken off and you wish to administer a push using an instrument, then insert into it a concave tool so that its cavity fits over the tail of the arrow; afterwards push with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the arrow is concave, then use an instrument to push against it as it enters inside it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	Indeed the arrow will be eased by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned, then you should scoop out all the concave flesh where the poison is; if this is possible for you to do.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with what suits it best.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow has fallen into the chest, or belly, or bladder, or side: and it is close enough that you can reach it with a hook, and it's possible for you to cut above it; then cut, and take care to avoid veins or nerves while extracting it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then stitch the wound if you see fit, and treat it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the shape of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The ends should be like the beak of a bird, which are made to look like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And there are many types of them made, large and small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its slenderness, and the width or narrowness of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of an impelling concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of a deafening impeller.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the end of a deafener that looks like a spoke so as to smoothen its entrance into the concave arrow, and impel it with this.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The end of this concave impeller is concave like a bird's feather so as to smoothen the arrow's entrance into it and its impulsion.

Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However it should not be sharp-pointed like the other lancets but rather broad at its tip.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And make the incision across [the vein] because its wall is nearby, and perhaps the lancet will break within it when it is thin.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	On bloodletting from veins in the two lachrymals.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	Chapter on the fleam of veins, according to Al-Zahrāwī.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	The veins of Algeberich benefit from bloodletting because it brings relief to the throat and prevents gum inflammation, as well as ulcers, lip cracks, and similar sores that can develop around the nose.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And when performing bloodletting on these veins, you should have the patient sit in front of you and tighten their neck with a cloth.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Next, turn the patient's lip inside out and look for two veins; one on the right side of their lip and another on the left. You can identify them by the blackness they exhibit.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And this is true because these veins are surrounded by smaller black ones.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Make an oblique incision on each of them.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If you're unsure which one is which and cannot distinguish them, focus your attention on the larger of the two veins; it will be more prominent.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	Perform the same procedure on the two veins of the upper lip, which are frequently treated this way. Also make an incision on each vein located on the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	After bloodletting from the cephalic vein, proceed with the bleeding of the vein located under the tongue.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	The benefit of bloodletting from the two veins under the tongue is that it provides relief for throat inflammations and soreness of the uvula and mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	When bloodletting these two veins, have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun. Lift their tongue and look beneath for one vein on each side of their mouth; both will appear dark in colour.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore, prick both veins; and take care not to harm your hand while drawing blood from them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For beneath these [veins] lie arteries, and perhaps there will be bleeding from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	On the three veins of the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	Now the three veins which one usually draws blood from at the elbow are present in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And bleeding of these is performed according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a wide rose myrtle thorn; or by lancing to a slight degree; or by cutting with the lancet, and this is known as Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Alnesil is as follows, which serves for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from these are the wide types, and fine ones according to the width of the veins and their narrowness The shape of a rose-myrtle thorn is wide as you can see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave veins, full ones, protruding ones, visible ones, thick ones, and those that contain thick, cloudy blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this lancet is of lesser width, and finer at the tip.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for bleeding of fine veins which contain thin yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On the bleeding of the basilica vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	Now, the basilica is one of these three veins for bleeding from.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws out the blood from ailments that are below the throat and neck, what follows in the chest, and the abdomen: and it is appropriate for the surgeon, when performing a phlebotomy, to beware of this, and be above all fear because beneath it lies an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will strike that artery, and there will be a flux of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is appropriate that he does not phlebotomize it with a sharp phlebotomy tool; rather, let him cut it with an alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	But if the basilica does not appear with a manifest appearance, then it is appropriate that you take away from it, and shift to another, or search for one of its branches; or phlebotomize in its place the tendon of the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is manifest indeed, and cut it with an alnesil phlebotomy tool, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you wish for the phlebotomy of that same [vein], then it is appropriate that before the constriction of the arm, you touch the place until you recognize the pulse's location.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with an encaustic [medium], afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using an alnesil, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware lest the strike fall through from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, as you tie the ligament, an inflation in the place that you marked with encaustic, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery; therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	But if you see the blood rise at the phlebotomy, like a child's urine, and it is thin, red blood; then know that it is from arterial blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then quickly do so, and place your finger on it over that long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then bind the arm and let him go; and the patient should avoid moving his arm; and be above fearing for it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And he must not move it for several days until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood is not cut off and it troubles you; and you do not have medicine at hand to help you then, cut the artery if it seems right to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its ends draw together and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of a pistachio and crush it; take half of it, and bind it on over the place where the vein is appropriately tightened, with a bandage and little plugs until the next day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if it is not cut off, then treat it with what came before from the place of recollection where the blood flow was severed; and his blood letting will not be difficult in most situations due to the smallness of the wound site, and the possibility of a bandage from an arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	§ On bloodletting of the Dark Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	Now as to the bloodletting of the Dark Vein; it is helpful because it draws out blood from above the head and below the body; for this reason, since, as we said, it is composed of a branch of the Basilica and a branch of the Cephalic.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	It is appropriate for the bloodletter to be above any fear resulting from his venesection, as beneath it lies a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds to the venesection wound and discovers a nerve, it happens that he falls into a trance, and his healing becomes difficult, and perhaps will never heal completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some people and is subtle and not shown, then you must place your venesection where you wish to make the incision with alnesil, and divert the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then separate the vein lengthwise.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The venesection of the cephalic vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and helps with eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	In this vein especially, if you wish to venesect it, do so by puncturing with an olive-wood lancet or a myrtle-wood lancet: since it is safer than all other veins because there is neither an artery nor nerve beneath.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it behooves you during venesection to divert the elbow's head slightly with a lancet and seek out a softer spot; and if it is not found on the first strike, it does no harm to repeat the incision several times upon it.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However perhaps in some people an abscess forms when it is not venesected on the first strike, but this abscess does no harm to them at all.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	The usefulness of phlebotomy and the precautions to be observed therein.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy and its complications arise from the patient's condition which you must consider for correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First of all, you should know that phlebotomy is not administered unless it is for the preservation of health and to maintain wellness as a precaution against sickness.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And for the phlebotomy to be done on one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the cephalic, the median (antebrachial), and the basilic vein.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And for the phlebotomy to be done at the beginning of spring while fasting; and in summer, autumn and winter after a meal when signs of fullness are evident.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And for the phlebotomy to be done on either day one or three after at least 3 hours have passed since eating a meal.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, phlebotomy administered during illness does not have a set time; rather it is done when circumstances and need call for it, be it day or night, at any hour and any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not advisable to subject boys to phlebotomy until they reach the age of 14 years.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be subjected to phlebotomy unless between the 4th and 7th month of her pregnancy.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should elderly people who have passed the age of 60 be subjected to phlebotomy.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	So when anyone wishes to be subjected to phlebotomy for whatever reason, they should cleanse their bowels before the procedure with a mild enema if there is retained faeces; lest the veins become drawn from the intestines by noxious putrid superfluities that harm vital organs during the phlebotomy.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	The patient should not undergo bloodletting if they are suffering from a feeling of repletion and nausea; nor when they are drunk or recovering from drunkenness until these conditions have been removed.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	The patient should not undergo bloodletting if suffering from dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	Bloodletting should be avoided after a bout of colic, vomiting, flux of the belly, sexual intercourse, and in cases of hard labour, exercise, vigil, fasting or any other thing that weakens the body's physical or animal strength.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Consider the state of the patient's bodily fluids before bloodletting - if their blood is thick due to food and drink or medication - it should be done with care.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	The patient should take a bath beforehand if this is not contraindicated for them; or else engage in some exercise to thin out the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	Bloodletting should be carried out around the third hour of the day as we have said; and try to ensure that their chest is free from any adverse emotions such as tightness, anger or fear on that day, along with physical conditions like exertion, pain, excessive sexual intercourse and so forth.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	The patient should have at hand things whose use people are accustomed to for their pleasant aroma and taste - such as aromatics, perfume or sweetmeats - in whatever quantity is possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	The bloodletter should sit on a pillow that is higher than the patient's; then they should extend their arm and rub it two or three times with their hand.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then the bloodletter should tighten the ligature using a strap, rolling it up twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	The incision should be moderate and even, for when it is uneven or excessive in depth, then it hinders the flow of blood; similarly with softening, it also impedes the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the incision it is necessary that the person bleeding themselves should rub their hands together until the veins fill and become apparent to touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the person bleeding another should wipe the bleeding point with a little oil that is old and proper for this purpose.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then they should place the forefinger of their left hand on the vein below where the bleeding is to take place, gently; so that the vein does not escape and the percussion [of the blood] is not stopped.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For there are veins which you will find to be like a fleeing rope during bleeding; and among them is one that is full of air; when the scalpel is placed on it, it contracts under the blade and deceives the person using the scalpel, nor does it open the vein for him; if it opens [the vein], then it is tight because of this. It is necessary therefore that he who uses the scalpel should be firm in character, and attentive to all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then put down the scalpel.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	So if the vein opens on its own, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then try again in another place below that spot by a little, or above it quickly; unless the area has swollen up.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If the area has swollen up or if the patient becomes weak, then leave him [alone] for a day or two days; and do not bind his wound too tightly.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps the heat of the swelling will be drawn out [by binding it].
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	One should not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then she should repeat the bloodletting procedure if she wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	But if the opening is small or the blood flows slowly and you fear that not enough blood will come out: then repeat the bloodletting procedure on the same hole following its direction and add a little to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this quickly before the site becomes blocked because blockage of the site has occurred in many people during minor operations.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	So if you see that the site is already blocked then do not repeat at all on this same site because nothing will be of use to you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something made from feces or oil on the site because this eases the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better here than plain oil or other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly apply the feces of oil in all your bloodletting procedures where you let blood from veins at points that block its flow and do this with either tyrian alum or sagene when put on one of these.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood becomes thin and is resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	But if a large blockage should occur at the bloodletting site - as often happens especially to those who have not been bled before or whose vein has a small opening then act quickly and put on the site a sponge soaked in warm water and salt, heated slightly: press this for one hour because it is dissolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And you should do this after the blood has stopped flowing from that vein itself or from another.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If there remains in the wound after a few days some blackness or greenness, it does not matter; and if you wish, put on top of it some dissolved aloe or myrrh: or something from the juice of menthe, that is, calament, or similar to this.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And very often indeed there occur abscesses and swellings at the site of bloodletting in the basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Place therefore your hand on it; then if you find softness under your pressure upon it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Make sure therefore, to place on it something from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow out of it from an artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make for it a plaster with something that has astringency, so as to harden the site.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And you ought to remove from every man blood according to the quantity of his strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears on top of the blood in terms of colour.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then allow it to exit until it becomes red; and similarly if you see that it is thick, then let it out until it thins; and likewise if it is sharp, let its sharpness be taken away.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary that for the one who is full and strong but requires bloodletting he should have a larger vein selected and the site of venesection made wide; while for him who is weak this must be done contrarily.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to extract it through the ducts and ensure that there is a narrow opening; furthermore, what is administered in venesection is better when the incision is transverse rather than a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of venesection is safe from excessive blood loss and nerve damage; it is also more commendable and safer than the other form of venesection which occurs along both length and width.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And for one who is used to fainting during venesection, it is necessary that they eat before the procedure by consuming a small amount of bread soaked in pomegranate juice; or secanihabin if heated; and you should remove some blood from them through three or four ducts.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if one is of a cold constitution, then they should take bread soaked in mu juice syrup, or aromatic honey syrup spiced with spices, or scented aromatic syrup before the venesection.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If fainting should occur during venesection and this is caused by excessive blood loss, then one must take a drink of meat broth with refined scented syrup; they should use aromatic algalia and anoint their chest with it; the other methods we outlined in the section on syncope under evacuation should also be used.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	However, for someone who wishes to drain their arm and whose blood is being evacuated due to its weakness but possesses limited strength, they should remove the blood gradually according to the amount of strength that can be mustered over consecutive days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But for someone who wishes to drain their arm and whose blood is being evacuated but possesses great strength, then they should do so seven or nine hours after the first venesection.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	He who wishes to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side to which it inclines must undergo this procedure on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In a body where there is much heated and inflamed blood, causing fever, it is necessary that blood be taken from it once every hour and removed in large quantities; the opening must be enlarged until syncope occurs. After observing all conditions of phlebotomy and as you place your hand on his pulse at the point where the blood flows so that death does not occur in place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For it often happens that this occurs when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence falls.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And when you wish to release the arm and stop blood flow a second time after the vein opening has already been closed making it difficult for blood to come out, it is not necessary to press on it with force and quickly stretch it in a curved way.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For this is very bad, indeed leave it be until the second phlebotomy.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the point of the lancet from the vein opening that which has coagulated from blood and place over it some salt dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place over it some of the ointment alfaroch or sagzenea and apply gentle pressure until blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the vein has already become inflamed then leave it be and do not lance it until the inflammation subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If however the need arises to take blood a second time and there is no other way, then either lance it over that place or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The rope-like vein on the arm is ligated at the site of the Cubital fossa, and the Basilic Vein, if they are not found, and remain hidden, since it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of its ligation is such that the patient introduces their hand into warm water until the armpit turns red and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it should be tied above with a ligament of moderate tightness.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Ligate it transversely bit by bit, not laterally nor longitudinally; and let your incision be wide, and make your ligation where you have ligated the joint of the hand a little way above.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the flow of blood is impeded, then immerse your hand again into warm water and let the blood run out into the water until you have achieved what you need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however it is summer days, then you will be exempt from repeating the immersion of your hand into warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	The running out of blood into warm water is indeed most appropriate in the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	This vein's ligation is safer than all other veins, because there are neither pulsating arteries nor nerves beneath it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Ligation of the Salvatella Vein of the right hand is beneficial for diseases of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its ligation is such that you should tie the back of the hand with a ligament or by hand after you immerse it into warm water until the vein fills and becomes very apparent to touch.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then ligate it transversally.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	Keep conserving, do not end with your hand with the lancet.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under it indeed are nerves of the fingers stripped bare of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return your hand to warm water, and let the blood run into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein and prevent its flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have extracted the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt over the vein: so that it does not clot quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And likewise you should do with every narrow vessel.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The benefit of his bloodletting from the left hand is that it relates to diseases of the spleen; and do likewise in its bloodletting, as you did in the second [vein], equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	However, the benefit of the saphenous bloodletting is for diseases which are in the lower part of the body, such as womb ailments and menstrual retention, kidney complaints, old hip and leg ulcers, and similar illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of this bloodletting is that the patient introduces their foot into warm water and rubs it until the veins stand out; then bind above the ankle with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	Indeed the location of these veins is at the heel, appearing towards the thumb; and they branch out from it on the sole of the foot with many branches.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	The incision should therefore be made on a wider part of it or near the heel in its cluster; for this is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you make the incision on the sole of the foot, then be careful to avoid the nerves that are beneath it and above the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	Place your scalpel on the part where you are going to make the incision from a side angle as if you wanted to cut it; and let the blade of the lancet be sharp.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the flow of blood is hindered, then immerse the foot again in warm water; and let the blood run into it until it is emptied out.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the lancet misses the vein at first, then repeat with the lancet somewhat higher up, for it is a safe place; and do not fear any harm from this, when you avoid the nerves as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the other foot's saphena vein in like manner.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The place of the sciatic veins is near the heel on the hollow side as we have said.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of its incision is relief for hip pain when it occurs because of hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of its incision is such that the invalid can enter the bath and hurry; and bind his legs on the side of the hip right up to above the heel with a thin cord four fingers broad, for it does not appear except for this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then make its incision in any way that seems best to you or with a side cut; and this is better, or make an incision, or cut it off by division.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	The location is safer and its presence is often very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you cannot find it and it does not appear at all to the senses: then take the phlebotomist's tool to some branch of it, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ears; and avoid the nerves, and let it drain as much blood as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the binding, and place skin over the spot of bloodletting, and bind up the spot.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	It heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	On Cupping, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cupping glasses are made from horns, brass, and glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	Cupping is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	It involves scarifying the skin to let blood out, or cupping without scarifying.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	This type of cupping that does not involve scarifying is also done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	One way involves the use of fire.
Aut est absque igne.	The other does not involve fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	There are fourteen spots on the body where cupping that involves scarifying and letting blood is performed.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	The first is the armpit cup, at the end of the head; another is behind the neck on the nape; others are under both ears; another is below the jawbone and under the lower lip; there are two cups that cover both blades of the shoulders; one is over the tip of the coccyx; there are two cups placed in the middle of both arms; and finally, there are two cups on the two shins.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And cupping does not extract blood for you from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore their power does not diminish as it happens with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor is it necessary to administer cupping with fire or without fire for any disease caused by fullness until the entire body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity calls for cupping due to illness or custom, we perform it at any hour, at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because there are people who when blood multiplies within them and they need its extraction through cupping, find heaviness in their head and sodahan.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them are those who find itching on their face and forehead, darkness, and dimness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them are those who scar the site of their cupping.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them are those whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth or a boil forms on their tongue and they spit out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them are those whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them are those who see blood and redness, killings, wounds, and things similar to these in their sleep.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see any of these things, and especially if it is on the thirteenth day of the month, we order cupping to be performed after two or three hours have passed from that time.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The advantage of wind-suction on the nape is that it brings relief to heaviness in the head and a clearing out for the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	However, it is necessary that this should be done after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And indeed these cups serve as a substitute for bloodletting in the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted for those of a cold constitution or with catarrh to use this treatment.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings them great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And for this reason it is not appropriate for the elderly or those with cold ailments of the head to use them.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But for whoever is diligent in its practice oblivion is generated over them.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for this reason you should instruct the cupper to lower their hand with the cup briefly towards the floor, in order to avoid the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Wind-suction or Alkehel is a substitute for dark bloodletting and venesection, and it brings relief to asthma, chest constriction, shortness of breath, coughing, and fullness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary to stimulate the Alkehel cup briefly, for if it is left too long it produces weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Wind-suction with the alhagdahim cup brings relief to head injuries, ophthalmia, migraine, and toothache, and is a substitute for venesection.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And you should instruct the cupper not to press their hand with scarring; so as not to cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Windpipe incisions, however, beneath the chin collect alcohol into the mouth, and gum decay, and similar conditions that are found in the mouth; and substitute for the bloodletting of the two lips elsewhere.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Windpipe incisions of the spoons bring together reflection and warmth.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Windpipe incisions of the interior parts of two nostrils bring help to the bloodletting of three veins, Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica: since it draws blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh; and those small veins draw from other larger ones until the drawing reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And you must instruct the windpipe incisor not to proceed much with the scarification: since it is a place that has been stripped of flesh, and underneath are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The windpipe incisor which is used on the anus brings help to haemorrhoids of the Anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And you must instruct the windpipe incisor to use a large cup and one made of copper: since the place needs strong suction, and perhaps delicate cups will break; and it should be scarified with deep scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Windpipe incisions of the legs diminish noticeably: since they draw blood from the entire body and bring help to old pains in kidneys, wombs, and bladder; provoke menstruation, and bring help to gout and sciatica; and substitute for the bloodletting of two saphena veins and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However they weaken the body greatly, and cause many people to faint.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the Ventosarum pack saddle is akin to the two-legged animal pack saddle of Ventosa.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the Ventosarum's position is such that you should place the cup on an empty bladder first and suck with moderate suction; do not prolong the application but rather apply them quickly and remove them quickly so that the fluids arrive at a location in equal numbers; and do not cease to repeat this and continue until you see the area reddening and swelling, and there is a redness of blood: then therefore make an incision and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Next consider the arrangement of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those of tender flesh who are few in pores, you should make one incision only; no more than that so as not to ulcerate the area.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the Ventosarum user to deepen the incision and lessen its breadth; moderate the sucking force regarding ease, speed, and gentle movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	But if there is blood coarseness, you should make two incisions.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	Indeed, the first liquid opens a way for subtle blood removal and its watering; and as for the second investigation it is an exquisite exploration of the extraction of coarse blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	But if the blood is very fecal, then make a third incision so as to achieve the ultimate outcome.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually or a little at a time, one incision suffices for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	But if we wish to extract much blood then we should make many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	If we measure that the blood is thick, then it must be scarified with a deep scarification; and an equal limit in scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What should be administered from the oils at the placement of leeches, and what leech therapy cautions against.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In the case of one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the leech sites be anointed with open, softening, resolving oils; if it is in the summertime, such as alkei oil, or violated oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from squash seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the wintertime, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or sebesten oil; and similar to those.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If, however, the superfluity is thick and cold; then let it be myrobalan oil, or balm oil, or white popinjay oil, or dill oil; and similar to those.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the leeching is of one with large pores and soft flesh; then it ought to be prohibited from oil, and it must be that these wash the leech sites thereof after leeching with rosewater, or with cold water, or with solatree water, or with squash water, or with purslane water; and similar to those.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is of much moisture, let him wash the leeches with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac; and similar to those.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Whose superfluities are thick, let him wash his leeches with old wine, or with lilac water, or with a dill decoction, or chamomile; and similar to those.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	You must take care to avoid exposure to wind when exiting the bath or steam room; it is advisable to remain indoors for at least an hour or two after bathing.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	One should not sleep immediately after exposure to wind.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is the procedure for regulating Wind Exposure or Bloodletting prior to exposure?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	After the procedure, one should consider first that if the patient who has undergone Wind Exposure or Bloodletting is of a choleric nature and their blood is marked by sharpness and inflammation then they must take cooling substances such as pomegranate molasses; also celery with vinegar and lettuce, and rocket: and things of this kind.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And remove all poultry, eggs, spices, and pickled foods from their diet; and things of this kind.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	If their complexion is cold, they should drink syrup of honey or alum water and rocket seed; they must take light wine which is neither old nor new: they are to be advised on small meals.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And remove all poultry, lamb; sparrows, that is to say small birds: and young pigeons they must not eat.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	On the day of wind exposure and bloodletting, drinks should be taken in preference to food; some people are to be given a drink at fixed hours of alfaroch theriac or medicine made with musk (i.e. nutmeg) or alesselithe before wind exposure: either prior to or after bloodletting to strengthen the main organs and refine the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	They should not take these drinks hot.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On flatulence without incision.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Flask-shaped foments which are without incision are used for flatulence which are placed over the liver, spleen, gout, and over the belly, navel, loins, hip bone: since these members do not bear an incision upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And they are not sought after, unless it be for drawing blood from a member to another member; as we place the flask-shaped foment over the nipples in the sickness of nosebleeds.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to remove cold, viscous flatulence from the member and transfer it into another; as we place the flask-shaped foment over the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it rarefies the member, warms it up, and removes pain because it has resolved that flatulence.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed over the kidneys when an obstruction or stone occurs in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	By the virtue of its attracting force it perhaps opens up an obstruction or removes a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And it acts similarly when placed over the liver and spleen for removing flatulence from both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these flask-shaped foments are used empty with incision only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are used with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are used full of warm water in cases of pleurisy; and that is to fill the flask-shaped foments, large ones, with hot water alone or water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The procedure for administering cupping with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	If the size of its opening is that of two open fingers as we have made it; and if its depth be half a palm's length; and on one side in about the middle there is a small hole of such a size to admit a needle: let it be made of copper or brass, of thick plates, smooth, equal, clean; so that when placed upon the body it may not injure the flesh; and within its centre, a transverse bar either of copper or iron whereon a candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this cup is made large; larger than the one we described and a little smaller than that according to the sicknesses and age of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For cupping for children, and people with frail bodies are other kinds than the cups used by men or strong persons.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The manner of placing this cup with fire on the body is as follows: first light a small wick made of coarse linen, or a little wax candle; and place it over the centre bar which is in the middle of the cup; so that when the fire is lighted, its flame does not reach to the lower part of the cup lest the patient's flesh be burnt.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place it on the body; and let your finger be over that hole of which I have spoken until you hold the cup firm: when you wish to remove it take off your finger from the orifice then steam will issue forth by this hole, and the cup will come away immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the wick again in its proper way and repeat the process if necessary.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the case of a cup used in pleurisy with water, there is no transverse bar or hole; and it is not applied except by filling up with water and placing upon the body only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the larger the cupping scarifier is, the more water it holds, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	On suspending the bloodletting cups.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Leeches are not applied to many places unless it is impossible to position the cups on those limbs because of their thinness, such as lips, gums, and similar.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a member stripped of flesh, such as a finger or nose, and similar.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is this: you should get leeches from sweet waters, clean of rot.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be left for a day and night in sweet water until they are hungry and nothing remains in their bellies.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is evacuated first with bloodletting and then with cupping.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then clean the member of the sick person until it is red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterward, they should be placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are full and fall off, and the site can be sucked with a cupping glass, then it is best; if not, wash the site with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, rub, and express (the blood).
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	But if the course of blood continues after the leeches have fallen off and it drips, then soak a linen cloth in cold water and put it on top until the dripping ceases.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If blood multiplies, then pulverize on it zegi that has been ground or gallnuts, and things similar to these from the astringents, until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place halves of peeled broad beans on the site [of bleeding], and leave them until the beans stick to the wound, for the blood will cease.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if repetition of leeches is needed, when possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If, however, leeches are prevented from hanging [on], then clean the site with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or fix a needle in place until something comes out of the [wound] in blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place them, for they themselves when they sense something of the blood, immediately adhere.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish them to fall off, sprinkle over them something of ground Aloe, or salt, or ashes; and they will fall immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A general discourse on the restoration of dislocations, their cure from torsion and similar afflictions.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary for the art of medicine and deals with the restoration of fractures and accidents involving dislocations in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know this, sons: fools of doctors and ignoramuses boast about this chapter, who have never inspected an ancient book nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it happens that this method is deprived of the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I never encountered in it any good whatsoever, and I did not achieve from it what I have achieved except due to the length of reading ancient books, and study upon understanding them until I extracted that science from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experiment and study throughout my life's length.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described for you from it within this Chapter all that my science contains: and about what has passed of my experiment after I abridged it for you, and relieved it of the busyness of elongation, and abbreviated it with final brevity, and showed it through final declination: and formed in it many shapes from the shapes of instruments which are administered within it when it is added to declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections of bone fractures, from those whose preamble is necessary before we begin the remembrance of broken limbs, and their various parts if any one of them is broken.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say within the prologue of this Chapter the summary statements and chapter sections which must first be understood by the practitioner to stand over their truth: namely so that you and those who are ready know or learn this noble craft, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say therefore that when a fracture or dislocation or twisting or fall occurs to someone then you must first hasten to bleed them and loosen them, or do both simultaneously unless something prevents it like weakness of strength: or is the one who this happens to a child or decrepit old man; or is it a time of intense heat or extremely cold frost.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	He should then be satisfied with his food, cold vegetables, and the meat of birds and kids; and avoid wine, fatty meats, and foods that fill the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are sure that the abscess is cured and there is no longer any fear of a discharge of matter to the limb, then let the patient return to his former diet with which he is accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the broken bone begins to heal, the patient should be fed with very nourishing and sustaining foods that are rich in nutrients and viscosity such as porridge made from cooked wheat flour with water, rice, heads, feet, tripe of calves, eggs, fresh fish; strong wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For this diet brings about the quicker and better knitting together of fractures.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And you should know that when bones are broken in men who have reached old age and decrepitude, they cannot always be joined together again and heal according to their natural state because of the dryness of those individuals' members; rather they are healed and joined at such places which remain soft like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However nature bonds over the broken bone from every side something like a glue that has thickness; this adheres to and tightens it until they are joined together and bound with one another until such time as it reaches its former strength and firmness such that is not prevented from doing anything it did before, and for this reason you must give nourishing food to the patient that have weight, viscosity, and a thick consistency just as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you should know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of members since a broken leg differs from a skull fracture, and a fractured breastbone differs from a broken spine; likewise all other parts differ one from another; I have come with an enumeration of every type of fracture set out in its own chapter.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the types of bone fractures also vary within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because it becomes an arched fracture, apart from when splinters occur within it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes it becomes a fracture along the length of the bone; and there are splinters, that is, broken pieces, and projections coming off, as in a reed when it is cut with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And there are no projections; and it is a fracture with a wound and disruption at the end; and it is a small crevice-like fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And for every type there is a specific tool or instrument for its restoration, as will be recalled later, set out in their respective places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from this the bone fracture is recognized—its tortuousness and its prominence; and its appearance to the sense [of sight], and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no apparent tortuousness of place, nor a sound on your touch when you handle the bone with agitation, and the patient does not feel great pain; then there is no fracture there, but possibly some tortuousness or small crevice: therefore one must not move it at all with hand and pressure, but rather place over it the medicines which will be recalled later, suitable to the place; then let it be bound with a fine bandage.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when a place becomes arched and splits into two, apart from when splinters occur within it, but still every part is removed from its fellow; then you must begin your hour of rectifying it by equalizing it before a hot abscess occurs to it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If he also has a hot abscess, then leave it for several days until the abscess quiets down.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then temper him according to whatever degree you please, depending on his gentleness and understanding.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that his recovery and the restoration of his equality is easier than that of a bone, where splinters occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind him according to what you will recall about it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	But if there are splinters in the bone, then an extension of this fractured limb is necessary from two parts, whether it is a hand or foot: or with your own hand, if it's a small limb: or with two ropes, or with one rope and one hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb over a level place, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then try with all your skill and in whatever way possible to bring back those additions to their places: and beware so as not to cause pain or injury on the weak by your operation: and try as much as you can with your strength to join one bone with its fellow according to better shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour for you to try and handle him with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see there anything unusual, correct it, and temper it with the measure of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of excessive extension or strong compression as many fools do it.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many times they cause through their operation a hot abscess or contracting of the limb: as we have often seen from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then attach it after equalization, perform the appropriate procedure, and secure that member; ensure rest and tranquility, and instruct the patient accordingly.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make sure he is cautioned not to move it during his watchful hours, or while asleep at the time of his turning, and agitating, and when making discharges, and all movements with his last remaining strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And he should be cautioned against placing the member in a position that causes pain to follow.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels pain or injury in the positioning of the member, then it must be changed to another position where there is no pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And caution him to keep his position equal and straight, so that the member does not become twisted when restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the fracture's fix is as I described it.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You should know that fractured members differ due to their smallness or largeness, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, for those that are small, such as the arm, finger, thigh, and similar, there should be a soft, fine linen wrapping.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	For those that are large, such as the hip or leg, there should be a wide, coarse wrapping.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	For a wide bandage connects the large member to itself on all sides of its equal binding so that no part is left uncovered.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then start by applying an appropriate ointment to the site of equalization after you have evacuated it; apply this onto a soft dressing over the fracture location.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage over the site of fracture itself with three or four turns, according as the limb deserves; and squeeze your hand a little with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with him to the upper part above the site of fracture, and squeeze less than your previous tightness where you tightened the broken area.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with the wrap away from the site of fracture somewhat, and loosen the tightness gradually until you obtain something large from a healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another splint, and wrap it again over the broken area with turns.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards go with the wrapping to the lower part below the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your work be in the tightness of the wrapping and its loosening, as we said about the first upper wrap.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the wraps some soft linen or cloth to fill any gaps due to the fracture's curvature, if there is such a curvature; otherwise do not put anything into it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap over the same splint with another one.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards place on top of these wraps pads made from linen strips cut off-centre immediately, if there is no swelling or hot abscess at the site.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	However, if there is swelling or an abscess, then place on it what sits over the abscess and draws off pus; and leave it for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten the pads over it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	The pads can be made from halves of reeds scraped and shaped skilfully; or they can be made from wood used to make sieves which are made from pine or cypress, that is, palm branches, or rushes: and the width of each pad should conform to this shape and have the same outline.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, the star-shaped instrument which is placed over that incision should be a little thicker and wider than the other instruments; and the length of the instrument should depend on the size and magnitude of the member.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie over the star-shaped instrument with another thread according to the same first ligation.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind above with threads off-centre, as we have explained about the ligation; and it is necessary that your ligation should be tighter over the place of fracture than elsewhere; and the more distant from the fracture the binding is, the looser it should be.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads should be moderate in thickness and fineness, and they should be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the case of some ignorant operators who use their own threads made from twisted linen cords, it is a serious mistake; for when these are pulled they slip out of position.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin threads are equally unsuitable; for you do not achieve the intended ligation with them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is necessary that there should be no more than the width of one finger between star-shaped instruments.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the patient is injured by the ends of the instruments after the ligation in healthy places, then place under them soft tow or crimson wool until nothing further is harmed by it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	But when there is a fracture with a wound, and it happens that the skin is torn, I shall return to this point specifically in chapter two.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And note that it is not necessary for every broken member to be bound with star-shaped instruments from the first day onwards.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because when a member is large, you should not place stars on it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your assessment of the risk of warm abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters by which the ancients restored what was broken or dislocated.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The method of the common abbreviated plaster that restores fractures and is suitable for many constitutions, especially women and children; since it is such that neither heat nor cold conquer.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is as if you were to take dust from the mill and marrow flour that hangs on the walls of the mill near the movement of the millstone: and prepare it just so except that sifters should sieve it with egg white: and lay down its mixture not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use this.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The method of another plaster that restores fractures, dislocations, and twists.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almess (almes), laudanum, acacia, enula (elecampane root) and mugwort; of all sucks take 10 ounces, myrrh and aloes each take 5 ounces, and alythil (galbanum) take 20 ounces; grind everything together three times and sift it with egg white or water: mix them with alethil water or egg white if the constitution of the patient is hot.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good constitution, restoring broken bones quickly and suiting many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	The method of another plaster that also suits fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugwort, mallow, and white althea, of each 10 ounces; myrrh, 5 ounces; aloe, 5 ounces; acacia, 6 ounces; Armenian bole, 20 ounces. All these are to be thoroughly pounded and then sifted, and mixed with water or a fresh egg white: they are then to be administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	The method of applying a plaster to joints or separated bones; it soothes sudden pain in them, and the bone dislocation, fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Let dressed wool be taken, submerged in vinegar and cooked oil; then place it on the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	This plaster has no restorative power but is good for soothing hot inflammations; and it specifically eliminates pain.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The method of applying a plaster which restores broken bones.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of deaf fig and wild poppy; grind all together to make a plaster out of both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The method of applying an abbreviated plaster to aid the restoration process for bone fractures; this is also effective when you want a remaining inflammation to resolve.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take althea root, chamomile, violet flowers and herb meal; all in equal parts. Grind them all up then mix with wine if the affected limb is not hot.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If the limb is hot then mix it with moist coriander water or just water; use as required.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	The method of applying another stronger plaster to resolve an issue; more effective than the previous one when a hard inflammation occurs during the limb's restoration process.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take a part of the root of althea, and a part of flax seeds, and balaustia, and mellilot, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and camomile, all in equal parts; grind them all up, and make an ointment with willow water, or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	Apply all of that according to the warmth of the limb, and the calming of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a broken limb during its restoration other than a poultice made of clay and oil; he specified that it should be neither too thick nor too thin.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen believed that things should be placed on a broken limb during its restoration which draw out heat and dryness, such as myrrh, aloe, frankincense, and other similar substances of the kind we have described.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The way to make an ointment which soothes wounds and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mallow, and chickpeas, and cut human hair or bird feathers, and althea, all in equal parts; grind them up, sift them through a sieve, then make an ointment from the mixture.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The length of time that the dressing should stay in place depends on when you observe that the patient is not suffering from pain or itching and the fractured bone has not shifted from its position; if this is so, then do not remove it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	But if they do experience severe itching or disturbing pain at the site of the dressing, or swelling occurs; then be quick to remove it within an hour and take away the ointment from them: instead apply a soft cloth or a soft marine sponge which has been soaked in warm water; wash the area with this until the itching subsides and the pain is settled.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Place over it a woolen compress soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil; bind this over for one night until you are sure the warmth has dispersed from the abscess, and let the limb rest until its inflammation subsides and its pain is relieved.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then return to the fine stitch and a small plaster; do not draw this tight like your first one but keep it light until healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess and redness are gone along with pain, inflammation, and all other symptoms, yet needing plaster or stitch, repeat as at first.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing has happened to the limb as we said then do not remove it until after three or four or five or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when you remove it after twenty days from the limb as seems to you from its solution as we said until bone adheres and flesh grows over, then add more stitches than your first set altogether: also give a greater increase in soft food than last time.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the fracture site drying out more than should, then know nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Scour it with warm water around each time you remove it and let this be for three days; also ease the stitch a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this treatment nourishment flows to the limb and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which ignorant restorers do on the other side of a fracture when it does not heal as it should and heals with twist is their treatment fault and great fear; if right they would have said so say the ancients in their books and done likewise.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen any traces of them whatsoever there, and it is more correct that this should not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Manufacturing an accident in the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	Types of fractures vary greatly in form and there are many causes.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	One type of fracture is caused by a sword strike; the blow removes bone down to the marrow beneath it, as an axe does with wood; hence this kind of fracture is called axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword cuts into some bone and nicks its surface but does not penetrate all the way through; this type is called kalaan, meaning an absolute levitation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	There is the fracture caused by crushing or grinding; its cause may be a blow with a stone, or a fall on rock, or something similar.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	This fracture can also be a penetration one, which approaches the membrane beneath bone; or it is on the surface of bone; and this wound may equally be either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	There is a fracture hidden within bone as fine as hair; it is a small crack and so this type is called capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	A fracture may result from a fall or blow by stone (or the like), which makes bone flake inward and form a hollow; as happens with air bladders when they are struck and some of their contents sink inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And indeed it occurs mostly in the heads of moist bones, such as are the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And there occur with all these types of fractures the dislocated, separated bones, and I shall come with a reminder of that whole thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these types of fractures by examination of them and investigation with probes, as well as the removal of corrupted flesh that is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The hairline type is recognized by this: when it is detected over the bone and wiped clean, and a cauterizing iron is passed over it; for the fracture then appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	But when treating a fracture, first consider the patient's condition: then if you see from their condition any signs that clearly indicate fear, such as vomiting, fainting, loss of intellect, loss of voice, syncope, acute fever, or red and bulging eyes, and other similar symptoms in many conditions, certainly they will not heal; and if you see conditions that do not terrify you, and hope for healing: then begin their treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if one comes to you wounded first with a bone wound: and it is in the days of winter, then you must strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day according to every condition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then you must hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what lies beneath the bone becomes corrupted and those conditions that we described occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the bone fracture has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and is accompanied by minute fragments and retraction: then you must cut away the comminuted and abraded parts, as I have described to you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And you should scrape away the scalp of the wounded person; and expose the bone according to any method that is possible for you, both in accordance with the shape of the wound and what is light over the sick person.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it should happen to you that during the exposure of the bone there is a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then oppose it with what is appropriate.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And you should fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil; and let the wound rest until the abscess subsides, and be confident that there will not be any flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method is to cut the bone with an Incisory knife of sharp steel; and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then apply another wider Incisory knife after the first; and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then apply yet another even wider Incisory knife than the previous one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	The second method is to have a number of different Incisory knives, some wider than others and some shorter than others; their ends should be very sharp and made of iron or steel: and strike them on the Incisory knife gently so as not to shake the head, and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If however the bone is hard and tough: then it is necessary to bore around its circumference before you apply the Incisories, with drills which are called Non-penetrating Drills; they are not so named unless because itself does not penetrate through the thickness of bone to that which is behind it, on account of a rounded end beneath the head of it, which is sharp like a chisel and a small circle prevents submerging into and penetrating the density of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	You should take a large number of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of the bone, until you have a drill for every part of the skull; the point of each drill must be suited to the length and breadth according to the thickness of that particular skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	These are three types of drills or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of the hole-making around the broken bone is such that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the drill to another place and put what is between all the holes in the thickness of a finger, or around it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Next, cut with knives what is between all the holes in the bone; make it thinner than you can on that side of fineness, as we have said, until you remove the bone either by hand or with some other of the instruments which you prepared for this purpose such as forceps and fine scissors.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And you must take every precaution to ensure that the drill or knife does not touch any of this dura mater.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have gone all around the bone by drilling and separated it from the dura mater, if this is continuous with it and you draw it out, then you must scrape and trim evenly that end which remains in the bone with another knife similar to the first one.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be thinner and finer than the other knives.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If any of the small bones or membranes remain, then take them away carefully with what you have at hand from among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound after that with dressings and ointments as we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And there is another method of operating which is easy and completely remote from danger; this was described by Galen, who praised it highly. These are his words.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first of all to begin by laying bare that portion of the bone where the fracture is most violent and evident; until when you have laid it bare, place under it this end of the Lenticular knife, which has this shape.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part, which is smooth does not cut anything; and its sharp part, which tapers on both sides lengthwise as you see, so that the lenticular part rests upon the siphon with its sharp edge facing toward the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike upon the knife from one side with a small mallet until you cut through the entire bone without difficulty, as it gives way; and be confident about your cloth wrapping so that nothing happens to it which you fear at all.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon were not stupider than other men and more ignorant of it; nor sleeping, then should any part of the cloth remain attached to the bone in certain places, he would cut that away from it with the end of this very lenticular knife, and remove it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is freed from that without injury and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not extend through to the cloth, and what is torn away from the bone is its surface, while roughnesses and fine splinters remain in it; then you must scrape off that roughness, and remove those splinters with fine scrapers of various sizes which you have prepared, so that you can use ones most suitable and best for each place according to what the operation leads you to, and also according to the fractured bone itself and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	You must ensure that your blades are sharpened, especially those of the scalpels.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use the finer one afterwards.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not stop doing this continuously until you reach the finest and sharpest of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	For each of the smaller hairline fractures and subtle breaks, it is essential to provide care in accordance with what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And this is something that cannot be hidden from anyone who has any interest in this art; they should pay attention to what we have written and demonstrated regarding major fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If a piece of skin is found to be retained when you remove the bone, then you must take a piece of linen cloth according to the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil before placing it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of cloth, doubled or tripled, and soak it in wine and rose oil before placing it over the first piece of cloth; do this as gently as you can to avoid irritating the wound.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Next apply a broad bandage on top; do not tighten it unless necessary to keep the wound closed; leave it in place for one or two days until you are confident that there is no risk of hot pus developing.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then remove the bandage and apply afterwards medicines that deal with excessive dryness; such as lily roots, herb flour, incense powder, aristolochia, and similar things; it is best to make a powder out of these medicines and sprinkle them over the wound like a dry dusting.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer to it all medicine whose property is to cleanse and not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And ensure that according to your skill, the wound during your treatment is clear and clean: with neither any ointment scum nor filth on it.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor should you allow any pus to form on it at all; for when pus forms over the brain's membrane, it corrupts and rots it and then a great harm befalls the patient after that: and this happens in head wounds too, once the bone is cleaned, especially if its treatment is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, consider that if any of the complications we've described happen to your patient, you should know it is undoubtedly harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness doesn't happen unless it's caused by the medicine you've put on it and it's in that medicine's power to make this blackness: then take one part honey, three parts rose oil, and mix them with linen cloths.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put it on this wound; afterward treat it with appropriate healing spices until it's healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On resetting a broken nose:
Caput IIII.	Chapter Four.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that only its two upper parts break at the same time or one of them; for it consists of two bones: since its lower part is cartilage, it doesn't break but can suffer abrasion, twisting and crevice formation instead.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two upper parts breaks, then you should put your little finger in the nose's hole and bring that broken part back into place with your index finger inside and thumb outside until it regains its normal shape; and do this skilfully but gently.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, lest your operation cause that pain upon the patient.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach it with your finger; then you must equalize with a small radius rod.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	But if the fracture is in two parts, then make it similar to that and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after seven or ten days during the healing of the warm swelling.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Next, insert a linen wick into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part; or insert two wicks if the fracture is in two parts: and let the wick be of such thickness as to fill the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that the wicks should be dipped in butter, and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That, however, does not seem right to me; rather, the wick should be dipped in white of egg, made with flour dust.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the wick until the bone hardens and the cartilage strengthens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose quill is inserted into the nose instead of a wick, after it is wrapped with soft cloth; and this holds the broken nose more firmly, so that the patient is not prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this thing is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that; and if you wish, use the wicks.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If, while operating, a hot pustule occurs on the nose again, treat it with nasal plasters made of caerbath or coto steeped in rosehip oil, or with a small amount of dyakylon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If a hot pustule does not occur, then the plaster itself should be made with sesame flour and powder of incense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft pad on top, and do not tie the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	However, if the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture or crushed, then it is necessary to make an incision above them and extract them using suitable instruments.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then suture the incision, and treat it with what promotes flesh growth and consolidation using appropriate plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If there is a wound between the nostrils, it should be treated with lint; and a lead pipe should be inserted into it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is disrupted.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is disrupted and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound, examine whether it is fractured on the outside only and has not broken into two parts, and that it remains within; then its diagnosis is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	If its fracture is on the right side, it is necessary to insert the left index finger into the patient's jaw; similarly, if the fracture is in their left jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and push with it the swelling of the fracture inward from outside with ease using your other hand from inside the displaced bone part, and align them.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two parts, then you must apply extension from both sides, according to its straightness, until it is possible to achieve alignment.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	However, if there is already loosening or breakage of the teeth, then you should bind those which you hope will remain with gold wire or silver, or with silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a poultice on the broken jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place on top of it a doubled cloth, and put on the cloth a large flat stone, or a piece of leather sole equal in size (to the jaw), lengthwise.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it from above according to how its binding has been prepared for you and the suitability of its application until it is healed; and direct the patient towards calmness and rest, and provide him with soft, easily-absorbed food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	However, if you consider that its shape is changing in some way, then hasten to remove the binding on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been altered from it, and apply a plaster to it made of flour of lentils with egg white, or with sesames flour; after you have removed the poultice, and place over this soft wool.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While the plaster remains bound to it, and there is no change in the arrangement of bones, release it (the patient) without removing it until it is healed; or if you bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture often takes three weeks to heal with binding.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If meanwhile there arises a hot swelling, then apply what we have spoken of many times to its reduction, until that swelling is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if there is a fracture with a wound, consider it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	If the piece of bone has already been separated from it, or by surgery: then consider carefully how to remove these fragments of bone with what is appropriate for you among your instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the wound's opening is narrow, then widen it with a scalpel according to your needs.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you have removed the fragments and none remain in it, close the wound if it is wide; but if not, place over it a plaster that suits its type, and heal it until healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the Forkbone when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The Forkbone is indeed often broken on its front side from the shoulder-blade, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it breaks and separates into two pieces without fragments; this is easier to restore.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or there may be bone fragments; this is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or the fracture occurs with wounding.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	The procedure in this case when the fracture is without wounding consists of making two assistants present so that one holds the support which follows the broken Forkbone and the other extends the neck towards him.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then align the fracture with your fingers until it takes its proper form without protuberance or depression.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then it is necessary that you place under the patient's ticklish spot a sphere made of cloth or wool; and let its size be according to the amount needed; extend and raise the fork, and shorten the sphere with your hand until the fracture is reduced as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot draw the end of the fork outwards because it has gone too deep, then the patient must lie on their back with a pillow of medium size under their shoulder; have your assistant press down on the patient's shoulder towards the lower parts until the head of the fork that is in the depths is raised upwards; and then straighten the fracture and align it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a splinter from the fork, and it moves, then you must cut open above it and extract that splinter easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then use your tool on its incision with one of the knives you prepared for it, after you have placed under the fork the preserving instrument; and this instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spoon that has no hollow.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	Its width should be according to the size of the bone by which you need it, and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length should also be according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	It should have two ends as you see, one end broad and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the wound opening that you cut when extracting the splinter of bone is broad and you are sure it is free from pus, then sew together the two lips of the wound with suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the rupture is small or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and dressings according to the size of the tear of the injury.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a hot abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	However, when a bone protrudes without a wound and without amputation, you should apply a plaster made from flour and egg white on top of it.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place soft tow on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then put a ball under the armpit if you need to support it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a haematoma, that is, the wheel used by the Saracens which should be very long and its width should be one palm or close to it.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a folded dressing on the tow and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a small wooden board whose width is three fingers long, and its length should be similarly so.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the wooden board in that place of the haematoma which falls over the fracture and joint.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the haematoma over the fracture as you have rolled it up and wrap it around their neck with one armpit above and another below; bring it back to cover every part such that the protrusion supports the bone; this is so that nothing will be hidden from you, and all of it in a way which does not remove the wooden board from on top of the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	You must examine the patient every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever the wound is softened, and you see that the bone has already moved; then straighten it, and tighten the splint.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient's pillow on his back, and put under his armpit, near their pillow, a small cushion at night, so that when they are lifted up it can support them from beneath.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Thus the fracture of the forearm is elevated by raising the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind their arm to their neck; and do not loosen the splint if nothing untoward happens from itching or an abscess until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster if you see that its surface has worn away.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to its tightness, and leave it until the fracture has healed and become firm.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	The fracture of the forearm is indeed tightened and strengthened greatly within twenty-eight days; and sometimes it happens sooner for some people.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the healing of a dislocated shoulder.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The shoulder is rarely broken except towards the outer side of it; and what breaks from it are only its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When a part of it breaks and the fracture is in its middle, and you cannot see this except by feeling; then according to the form of the fracture attempt the preparation for it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it as much as you can with all your skill to its original shape.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place flour powder from a mill with egg white on the wound, and soft lint, and put a little bandage made of doubled cloth on top.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place over it a flat wooden spatula with an edge that is as wide as the entire spatula or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If however there is any indentation under the spatula at some of its places, then fill this indent with soft lint until it descends to equal level.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then strap it on top with long bandages of linen that are tight-fitting and secure the spatula firmly until you cannot move it from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And check the dressing every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the dressing softens therefore, tighten it and level out the spatula if it moves from its place; and let the patient lie on their healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is replaced after twenty or twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number of days is complete therefore, untie the bandage; and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is made of bones whose fracture or separation is not feared.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if you find that a piece of bone has broken off and is sticking out through the skin, then cut above it, and take it away.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we have said regarding the treatment of a broken fork with hot poultice if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	On repairing fractures of the chest.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in its middle part, and this happens rarely.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities indeed break frequently, and get crushed due to its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle part breaks towards the lower parts, and it suffers great pain, and difficulty in breathing, along with a cough; and maybe vomits blood, as well as reveals the depression of the broken bone, which does not escape feeling, The restoration is to make the patient lie on his back on his bed: and place pillows between their shoulders.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and bring the ribs together from both sides with your hands: and carefully align it in every way possible until the shape of the bone returns to how it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and a poultice on top of it, and put a star-shaped splint made from thin willow or hazel wood over this, and ones similar to its lightness, after you have wrapped them in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then carefully bandage it over the broken bone so that it does not move: and go with the bandage around its back several times, and tighten it with an appropriate tension.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then check the bandage every hour, and whenever it loosens, tighten it: and if its condition leads to a need for removal due to itching or corrosion in that place, or pain, or abscesses: then hurry up and remove it, take off the plaster, and correct what happened with an appropriate way of treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then bring back the plaster if you see it facing outwards: and attach a new bandage to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	The restoration of ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that rib fractures do not occur except at the thick parts which follow the back and from their ends on the front side.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they do not suffer abrasion except for this reason: that they are made of cartilage.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	Perception of the same is not hidden from sense during investigation with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And their restoration is done in this way: you bring the fracture back together with your fingers as much as possible until the shape has been restored to what it should be.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plaster casts and bind the broken bone with splints if they need it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the rib fracture is towards the internal organs, then the patient experiences severe pain and stabbing, like the stabbing which occurs to one who has pleurisy, because of this the bone pierces the lung and they also experience difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting a lot of blood; this condition is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	The ancients have devised many ingenious techniques for this and among them are those who say that you should feed the patient food which causes inflammation and gas in order to inflame the abdomen so that it extends outwards and pushes the fracture out towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We however reject that it should be done quickly to cause a hot abscess if one does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if an abscess has already occurred then you should put something else into it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: a gas-causing substance should be placed on the site and then sucked out with force; this is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, there is a concern that it may draw superfluous fluids towards itself due to its weak constitution.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the wound be covered with wool that has already been soaked in warm oil; and they should place little pellets between the ribs until it is full, so that there may be an equal binding when you wrap it around according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Afterwards the patient should be treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	But if the patient is severely oppressed by it and cannot tolerate it, and when we open up the bandage their mouth is injured by the sharp object, and we fear for the patient; then we must cut open the wound and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we should place on it the instrument for healing a fracture, which has been mentioned previously; and we cut through the bone with ease, and we set the broken ends together.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Afterwards we should bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a stitch; and we heal it with plasters until it is cured.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	But if a hot abscess should occur meanwhile, then hasten and pour little pellets into rose oil, and place it on the wound; and the patient will be treated for an abscess with what is suitable to its condition.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile they should also lie on their side until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of fractures of the vertebra of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed fractures of the bones of the neck sometimes occur; and they rarely suffer abrasion, just like the vertebra of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When this happens to someone and you want to know if they will recover or not, then consider the following factors.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	If you see that their hands have become soft and numb, and dead; they cannot move them, stretch them or grip with them; and when you squeeze them with your fingers and prick them with a needle, they do not feel it and there is no pain: then know that they will not recover, and in most cases this condition is fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if they can move them and feel the grip with their fingers and the pricking [with a needle]: then know that the bone is undamaged, and that the patient will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the same condition affects the vertebrae of the back, and you want to know if they will recover or not, then consider their feet: if you see that these have become soft, and what happens in them is similar to what happens in the hands, and when they lie on their back wind goes out and waste comes out without control; and when they turn onto their belly, waste comes out without control; and when they turn onto their back again, and want to urinate but cannot: then know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore do not trouble yourself with treating them.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If none of this happens to them, the condition is less serious.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for this condition is to apply a soothing poultice of warm compresses; so that you place on the affected vertebra only rose oil mixed with ground beef.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Apply this several times a day until the warm swelling subsides; then place over it one of the tightening, drying plasters and bind it tightly with a bandage: and instruct the patient to rest and remain calm.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	He must not sleep on the side where he finds pain until it is cured.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If this happens due to the grinding of bone splinters or something that has already separated from it, then you must cut above the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with any flesh-colored ointment until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	But if the last bone of the hip is broken and it is the end of the tailbone: then you must put your left thumb into the anus, and with the other hand equally align the broken bone as far as possible, and do this a second time.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place something over it, remove it, and treat the wound with the previous cure until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	On restoration of the anus.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Bones of the anus rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they do break, then their fracture is not a break but rather crushing at the ends; and they are split lengthwise and fall into the bowel; and it happens that the patient feels pain in the place, and an ache; and the leg that was broken goes to sleep.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is that you must extend your hand over it until you feel the fracture as shown in the figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at its ends then align that fracture according to what is prepared for you in the figure until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If the fracture is longitudinal or has already shifted inward, then have the patient lie on their stomach until you prepare to repair the fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have therefore equalized it, place a plaster cast upon it; then put on top of it a splint made of wood or leather, and bind the binding firmly over which you fear no change in the fracture nor displacement of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	Evenly compress the concavity with that which fills it until the binding takes hold of it equally; and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If a hot swelling should occur, then cease extending it and repairing it until the hot swelling subsides; and place on top of it what sits upon it as previously described, then return to its repair; and bind it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If there is splintering of the bone or shattering, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the repair of a broken arm.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The splint is that which is between the elbow and the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it breaks, its repair is by one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is to take a flat piece of wood, half the thickness, in this shape that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And bind two bindings at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then hang it from an elevated place; and have the patient sit on a chair.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	He should then place his broken arm on a wooden support until he reaches his little finger, in the middle of which is attached the curved part of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang something heavy above it so that it stretches out his arm downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor should align the fracture with his hands until it returns to its proper place.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	Another method is to have the patient lie on their back with their neck bent backwards; then hang his arm from his own neck using a strap.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Instruct two assistants to hold it; one above the fracture with his hands and the other below, each pulling in their own direction.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you want a stronger extension, then bind below the fracture with one strap and above it with another; each of the two assistants should pull in their own direction.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, then one strap should be placed below the little finger and another below the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow joint, then a strap should be placed above that point and another above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then align the fracture easily without effort until it is properly aligned and well set; then bind it if there is no hot swelling.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If there is hot swelling, then leave the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on it a woolen compress soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the swelling subsides; then bind it; the method of binding is to apply a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a bandage made from new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then bring their arm up for support, and place their open hand over their shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place the cloth and secure it tightly over their arm as a splint, so that the arm remains fixed in position; if nothing hinders you from doing this, then no part of the broken bone will shift against you.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something from the broken bone might shift against you, then use splints; and it is best to place over the fracture itself a splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place your finger between the width of each splint; and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an additional three fingers' breadth on either side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind tightly over the splints using the binding I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is best that your binding be tighter over the area of fracture itself.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture extends, let your binding be less tight.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see that the splints and binding are placed as we have said when you restore their limb just now, then do so; and if you fear a hot inflammation, then loosen the binding and remove the splints until the seventh day, as we mentioned.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then inspect the ligature every three days so that there is no itching or swelling at the site, nor does food fail to reach the limb due to excess binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore correct everything according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If it is with confidence that nothing will happen from it, then do not remove the ligature unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And if the patient's sleep is on their back with their hands over their stomach, place beneath them as a pillow a pad full of wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider every hour of the night or day to ensure that the broken member's position is not altered nor the ligature loosened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore, rectify it all with your best efforts.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And provide the patient's food according to the order we outlined earlier, so that their diet is soft at first until the jaw begins to tighten; then you must thicken their food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the jaw and leg are usually bound for forty days; it must then be loosened, a bath administered, and it is anointed with ointments that correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	But if the fracture is foul and crushed, then do not remove from it the ligature and splints for fifty days or up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	### On Restoring a Broken Arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones which are called the two forearm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of these is small; this one follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	The other one is large and it is placed below the small bone from underneath.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps only the larger forearm bone is broken, or perhaps it's just the smaller one; perhaps they are both broken at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When the lower jaw is broken in a small area, its restoration is easy and healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower jaw is broken badly, its fracture is bad, and healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	This situation is worse when both bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If the broken bone is a small part of the upper jaw, it is best for the doctor to apply a small extension during its restoration until they are level.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If the broken bone is a large part of the jaw, then a very strong extension must be applied.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	A hand-shaped mould should be placed during its restoration with the extended part elevated on a pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	The thumb of the hand should be higher than all its fingers and its knuckles lower than any other or the rest: the patient must then sit square on themselves with a pillow before them or directly under them at an elevated height so as not to cause them effort.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the attendant should extend their arm from beneath it or with their hand or with a ligature.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	Another attendant must similarly extend from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor should level the bone until it is returned to its best possible form.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	But if there are splinters of bone in the fracture then try to restore every piece back into its place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If however you see a splinter that has separated and is piercing the skin, with no hope of restoring it, then find its place and remove it as we have said above.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If there is a fracture with a wound, I have already made a special chapter on it, so take the treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If at the beginning of your restoration a hot abscess occurs, then line a piece of cloth with an ointment made of rose oil, white wax and beeswax of medium thickness and softness: bind the cloth on it tightly with fine bandages until the abscess subsides; then remove the ointment and apply a plaster prepared from flour and egg whites.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then apply splints; the one applied over the fracture itself should be somewhat wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And note that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases; whether there is a fracture in one bone or two bones at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then apply your bandage over the fracture site more tightly and strongly; somewhat tighter above or below it: or make the bandaging softer where indicated earlier in this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And the cloths that wrap around the fracture should be soft and moist; not hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And the thread that binds it should be of pure linen, medium between fine and coarse, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And examine the limb and its ligaments after several days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything that requires correction occurs, such as itching of the limb: then you should bathe the limb with warm water until the itching stops and release the limb from bandaging until it rests; after that repeat the binding.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage is already loosened, and the bone removed along with similar things: then you must correct it all by your skill, and examine it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	If nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive constriction, then you must soften it a little and leave it for several days until nourishment can reach it again, then tighten it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If none of the aforementioned problems occur to the patient then they need not be released until after around twenty days.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then let the patient's hand hang from their neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	Their neck should be level [with the wound] and they must be prevented from any violent movements by their own strength.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	Make them sleep on their back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	This fracture heals within thirty days or thirty-two, perhaps twenty-eight.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this depends on the characteristics of the individual's constitution and strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the healing of fractures to the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	It is rare for the fingers or knuckles of the hand to suffer fracture.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	This does not occur unless by frequent attrition [of these bones].
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When fracture or attrition of the heel occurs then the patient must be seated square [on an elevated seat] and a corresponding stool placed before them.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place their hand upon it, outstretched.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then let the attendant stretch the broken bones until they join together with good alignment.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and lint, lest a warm abscess occur.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Next place the dressing on top according to the size of the wound, and you have now wrapped it with a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is towards the lower part near the sole of the foot, then make a similar sphere out of cloth and advise the patient to press their fractured foot against it; afterwards bind it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the dressing be made of leather, which should be soft so that it conforms to the shape of the foot; and bind it as tightly as is required.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is on the outside, then you must place a dressing on top and another underneath on the sole of the foot; and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Next bind it as you would wrap the hand, and extend this binding between the toes with a bandage.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If any of the joints are fractured, then if it is the thumb bind as required.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind it with the foot, and if there is swelling apply a straight dressing to it; this will raise the fracture and prevent movement.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is in any other fingers such as the middle, index, little or ring finger; then bind it and secure it with a healthy finger next to it, or you may bind all of them together in sequence which is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or apply a small dressing on top as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And be mindful of the restoration process and afterwards as you deal with any warm abscesses; apply what is necessary when something occurs according to your instructions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	The restoration of a broken hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is frequently broken, and this becomes apparent to the senses: since it turns towards the inner and rear parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in such a way that the ligament above the fracture is tied tight, and another ligament beneath the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient shall be laid out on their face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then the attendant must stretch out every ligament to its proper place according to its equality: and this when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if the fracture is near the root of the hip bone, then let a ligament be towards the pectineal muscle, so that the stretching goes upwards: and another ligament beneath the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then let a ligament be near the knee, so that the stretching goes downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician should equalize the bone with both hands until it is brought back to its normal shape; and the bone must be joined by a good joining together.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to put on a plaster cast and bandage if the limb does not develop an abscess.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if there is an abscess, then leave it for a few days until the hot abscess subsides; afterwards return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandage should be like this:
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	You must wrap over the fracture a piece of linen cloth, that is, a bandage; and twice double it, or even triple it: and let there be some extra left over.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg until you reach the heel at the base of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	Insert a long thread between the hip and leg near the knee towards the bottom, and the ends of the thread come out from the upper part of both sides.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap the remaining bandage over the leg and hip.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place splints over the hip at the fracture site, and put one splint over the leg bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the gaps between the leg and hip with soft pads to even out the tightness.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then start with a tight bandage from the middle, over the fracture site with three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the further you extend the bandage from the fracture site, let your bandaging be looser and softer.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then go towards the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Tie with both three splints which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with the two ends of thread towards the bottom until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both, tighten the ends of the splints from the other side so that the bandage does not come off its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then leave the bandage on until it is healed so that no erosion, abscess or swelling happens to the limb and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If any of these happen, then...
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Soak it with the remedy for that problem, and correct what happened completely as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If there is a piece of bone that pierces from the bone itself: then it must be removed equally, if it is possible for you to do so.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, put it over that [piece of bone], remove it, and care for the one whose mention has preceded, until they are healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is tightened, besides what is added to it are splints, as we have said for the aid and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, with this fracture being restored in such a way as to not cause the infirm to limp.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored solely, besides what is applied to its other leg, then it is necessary that the infirm will always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you should know that the hip is tightened within fifty days, or slightly more, or less: all of this depends on the diversity of complexions and other bodily dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On restoring the fracture of the knee-cap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that the knee-cap rarely fractures but often becomes worn down through attrition.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If the knee-cap does fracture, then it will either be a crack or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And this occurs both with and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands over it all with feeling.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that what has been torn apart from its parts will be levelled with the digits until it joins and knits together as far as possible in terms of evenness, ease, and knitting.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then apply a plaster made of sesame flour or wheat flour with egg white: place over it a round splint if needed: and secure this from above with a suitable bandage to hold it in place.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements we described for other fractures such as warm inflammation and similar conditions; apply to each whatever is appropriate until healing occurs.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	## On Restoration of a Broken Leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should be aware that the leg has two bones; one is thick and called the thigh bone, and the other is thin and known as the shinbone.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	Both types of leg bone can fracture in the same ways as the two bones of the arm; consequently, their restoration is equal and treatment is identical.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both leg bones break at the same time, the leg becomes completely dislocated.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	If the thin bone breaks, the leg turns towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	If the thick bone breaks you will find it below; and this is among those that are not concealed from view.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then apply traction, alignment, and splinting equally as for the arm.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the leg fracture is severe with many jagged edges, you must apply less traction and gentler alignment.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	The treatment of the leg differs from that of the arm in one respect; when you have aligned the splints and completed all other steps, take two wooden splints made from pine used for roofing tiles and crafted from palm leaves: choose those with medium thickness and not too thin; their length should match the distance from knee to foot.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then roll each cloth twice along its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg from one side, and the other from the other side; and let they be from the knee down to below the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two bandages in three places at both ends and in the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when restraint is prohibited, the leg deviates to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now let there be administered a splint of wood according to the length of the leg, and place the leg upon it so as to preserve it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed you should most definitely do this for a fracture when there is an accompanying wound.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then examine the leg every day, and be attentive to it with the utmost care from abscesses, or swelling, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore anything of these happens, then oppose it with that which is necessary until it be cured, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, the calcaneus does not completely fracture.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot sometimes fracture, as do the toes; and they only break in multiple places due to abrasion.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If the bones of the foot fracture and you see those bones rising above one another, then let the patient put their foot upon prepared ground as if they are walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Stand thou then, and place thy foot over that which is elevated from those bones; afterwards press, or trample it down; and make it even until it returns to its proper place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply the plaster and put some tow on top; place under the belly of the foot a small board with two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a bandage suitable for the foot, after you have wrapped it up with linen and other things that are required.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days have passed, then untie the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find that the bones have become even if they were broken or displaced.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation for them is therefore as you see it to be.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if any of the toes are broken, restore them and make them even according to what I have explained to you concerning the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a splint under the toe according to its length and make it slightly wider; then put beneath the foot this board which I have explained to you, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	But if what is broken of the bones is two or three or more, then place a splint over the whole toe of its appropriate size wrapped in linen cloth; bind this board at the lower part of the foot; and let it stand on one end of the board outside the belly of the foot so that it may hold by good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you to remember all that I have said concerning other fractures from the accidents which we have discussed; apply everything appropriate to each accident.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	On the fracture of a woman's pubic bone, the peg-like bone, and the man's thighbone.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's pubic bone is fractured, make her sit on a square-shaped seat.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her slightly towards the back of her body and have someone hold her from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife should fill her pubic region with cotton wool until it is full and a sphere-like shape is formed from the pubic bone.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then shake the woman gently and slowly raise her back up.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cotton wool will exit until it is like a sphere before the pubic bone's opening, and the broken bone returns to its place.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a small cushion under her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	So when she wants to urinate again, gently remove the cotton wool and let her urinate; then return it as you first put it in; afterwards, have her go back to her cushion.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Have her do this for seven days or so until the bone is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a lizard's gallbladder and bind it with a reed tube over the opening, then insert the entire gallbladder into her pubic region.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with might until the gallbladder is inflated within her pubic region as the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it should be filled with cotton as we described, for several days until she is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	When the bone of the pecten in a man or woman breaks, then treat it with the same procedure and apparatus that we described for repairing the ankle bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	The correct procedure is not hidden from those close fractures which rarely occur, especially to one who has some expertise or practice.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, because this very fracture itself will indicate to you the correct procedure for setting and splinting it in many cases; so do understand it.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the male penis is broken, take the throat of a goose; insert this rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place over it a bandage made of cloth and wrap the area up; keep this on for three days or thereabouts, and if God wills, healing will occur.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On repairing fractures with accompanying wounds.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	If a fracture occurs along with an open wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the hip or thigh or similar, you should bleed the patient without delay; if the indications for bleeding are present, proceed according to what has been mentioned before.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound is discharging blood, you must proceed promptly to cut away its edges; sprinkle over this some ground zege (Cyperus rotundas) powder if no other medication is immediately available.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to treat the fracture on that very day; do not postpone this unless an abscess occurs later on.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If an abscess of the hot type occurs, then delay treating the fracture until the ninth day, so that the abscess may subside.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third day or the fourth at all, for you would cause bad things to happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If the broken bone is prominent under the skin, you should attempt to realign it and make it even with your hands gently and with little force.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If its extension is not prepared and you cannot realign it with your hands, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And this is an instrument that is made of iron, its length being the quantity of seven or eight fingers, and its width according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this reason it is necessary that the physician take three or four of them according to how much he needs for its treatment in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it should be round, with a small thickness so that it is not doubled when compressed on top of it during the procedure, and have sharp edges with a bevel at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And its upper part should be rounded to thickness from the middle of it down to its lower ends.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, the physician must place its sharp curved end over the protruding bone and push it with one movement until the broken ends are brought together in alignment.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Try to bring the ends of the fracture into alignment with each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the end of its broken bone is thin and does not take the instrument well, then it is necessary to cut off the end of that bone until the instrument can get a good purchase on it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce it with what we have described, then cut it with what is appropriate for it from the incisions we mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape off what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	So when the bone is reduced and the patient experiences severe pain after its reduction, then you know that it has not returned to its natural position.
Fac ergo illud.	Do so.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you cause the patient great discomfort when your restoration of the bone is complete.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse a cloth in black astringent wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not apply poultices, nor anything with oil; so as to not cause the wound to become gangrenous and corrupt.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer pills at the hour of your completion of the bone restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound open; such that you cut a hole with scissors into the bandages according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And be careful not to bind the wound tightly over the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times have stupid doctors done this; and they caused the death of their patients, or gangrene, or pus, that is, suppuration.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And your binding should be soft, gentle; different from the bindings of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is serious or extensive and you fear some of the complications we have described and find that there is pain at a particular spot, then it should not be necessary to apply stars over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make rolls from hard linen cloths instead of the stars and compress it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	However when it is after one day or two and you see the wound begin to produce pus then remove from above it the linen cloth which you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply dressings and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds like the four-ingredient ointment and those similar to it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is advisable that you loosen any binding.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every day morning and evening until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And the limb should be prepared so that pus runs freely from it downwards.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If much time passes since the injury was sustained and it does not heal or cease producing pus then you should know that there are small splinters of bone within it.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	For this reason one must probe the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of these small splinters have become detached you must remove them and extract those still within the wound.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And of those that are not detached and pierce the flesh causing pain one should attempt to cut them so they may be removed by any means possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If a proud flesh or spreading abscess arises from the wound that is, an inflammatory swelling of various kinds or another type of corruption and putrefaction then one must apply to each accordingly with what has already been described in their respective chapters.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from that which is necessary for my speech to stand on, and to whom you make your present mind when a bone is broken, and it protrudes above the member, like the hip bone, and the assistor, and similar to these of the large members, there is, so as not to presume its traction, for many times death occurs from it; indeed, leave it alone until it rots.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps indeed it will fall by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore treat the wound if it seems to you; and if not, leave it be.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On treating skin nodules on a fracture site.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Many times, this nodule occurs on the site of healing from fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially when it is near joints; and the shape of the member is affected by it.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps prevents the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider it then, if the nodule is fresh; apply to it medicines which have astringent properties, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, resin, gum arabic, and similar.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Such that you take from these some or all of them; mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and place this mixture on the nodule, wrapped in lint, and bind it tightly.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the binding, do not remove it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then dissolve that binding, and apply another, until the nodule is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Either tightly bind over the same sheet of lead, off-centre.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead is the property of removing all that is feared from the members.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the stitch has already turned into a stone and it is tight, and necessity urgently requires its removal: then find it on top of it from its upper side, and cut off the protruding superfluity; or scrape it with some scrapers until it is removed: and take care of that place until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	On the treatment when restored, and the member remains thin after that, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the fracture of bone is restored, and the member remains thin after that, weak: then it is not so but for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is the abundance of loosening and binding the bandage not as it should be: either due to an excess of tightness of the bindings until nourishment is prevented from reaching the member; or due to an abundance of superfluous ointment at the wrong time; or due to a lack of blood in the body of the patient, and their weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its treatment is to feed the patient, and make their body soft until blood multiplies in them.
Et administra balneum.	And provide a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and happiness over them.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put tar on the member: so that it draws the poison to itself greatly.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And treat it with frequent ointment of warm water until nourishment runs through, and returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	The treatment of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a limb has already been restored after its healing in a crooked manner, and there is an elevation of the broken bone, or knottedness: and it is marred by this defect in the shape of the limb, nevertheless the limb is not hindered from its natural operation: then you should not heed the counsel of him who thinks that the limb ought to be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have been many foolish physicians and restorers who did that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is truly blameworthy, leading to death or great fear, so that it might be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and knottedness are recent: then it is necessary that [the limb] be embrocated with warm water, in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as althea leaves and its root, and conyfy, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And make for him a plaster with a softening plaster, such as properly made dichile.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucilage of althea root, and mix it with goose fat or sesame oil: and plaster [the limb] with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take fat figs, and pound them with pigeon dung, and similar things which are called by the name of medicines that reduce solidity.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes knottedness is resolved by frequent, old, and gentle friction which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And the movement of the limb should be applied to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If the curvature has already progressed and become severe, and it has turned into a bone spur, and the need for treatment with iron has arisen, then one must cut its upper part, release the bone continuity, and incise what is excessive due to nodulation or bone with delicate cutters; and care should be taken in that with diligence and effort.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	About the discussion on dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the displacement of certain joints from their proper place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Why it is forbidden to move [it] itself, and the shape of the limb is distorted.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes severe pains and injuries to happen in the afflicted person.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When dislocation happens to someone, then one must hasten to restore it; and not delay [it] at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if one delays [treatment], the site becomes inflamed, and perhaps with that reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Because of that, it is not advisable to move [it] or stretch during the hour of its inflammation.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Since it often causes spasms and painful injuries to happen.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then one must hurry to the bloodletting of the patient.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then leave [it] alone until the inflammation quiets down.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	After that, the limb should be anointed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be pulled out gently.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every part that comes to mind must be treated with respect.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already arranged the headings of dislocations, as well as what preceded it with regards to fractures, from top to bottom of the body.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On treating the dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Both jaws rarely become dislocated unless it's just one of them.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the only way both jaws can become dislocated is through one of two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they may be slightly removed from their places by slight movement, and somewhat softened in the process.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they may become fully dislocated until the jaws soften at the level of the chest, and so much saliva runs out that he cannot hold it back, nor can close his mouth, and his tongue is rolled up with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	But when the dislocation is slight, it returns to its place of its own accord after a short while.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If it is a complete dislocation however, then its reduction must be administered quickly and not delayed at all: the assistant should hold the patient's head, while the surgeon inserts his thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw between their teeth if only one jaw has become dislocated.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or they may insert both thumbs together if the jaws have become dislocated on both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And his remaining fingers should stay outside of the patient's mouth with which he holds it steady.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the patient to clean their jaws and move them around for chewing on all sides.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician should move the jaw to one side, and push it until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If its return is difficult, especially if both jaws are affected at the same time: then apply steam with warm water and oil until it becomes easy to move them both; do not delay reducing movement of either side at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they return and are level with each other, and the patient's mouth is closed without any slackness: then place over them small pieces of cloth that have been coated in wax; and rose-scented oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Afterwards, bind it with soft bandages without difficulty.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And the patient should sleep on their back; and place his head resting between two pillows so that he cannot move it from side to side; nor shall he attempt or be forced to chew anything; rather let him take his food by gentle suction until such time as his pains are removed, and his jaw loosened: then may he eat what he wishes and give it without difficulty.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not exert himself in the use of his mouth for eating, drinking, or yawning until such time as the jaw is loosened and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	But if the return of both jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and do not return to their places; then often there result from this fevers with constant sweating: and perhaps the patient's stomach is loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Therefore when you see this, then know that it is a grave matter; and often the patient whose jaws are so dislocated dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On reducing the dislocation of the Fork bone and upper arm.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The Fork bone does not become dislocated from the inner side because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	It becomes dislocated sometimes outwards, which is clear to sense perception.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is for the sick person to lie on their back and stretch out their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then squeeze the area with your palm using firm pressure because it will go back into place.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then apply an ointment and compresses to it and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities that follow the elbow and are continuous with it do not become dislocated except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	But if it does become dislocated some day, then it must be restored and adjusted according to what we have said and prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put an ointment and compresses on it and bandage it tightly.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the sick person to remain calm and at rest until they have healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment the upper arm is restored when it too becomes separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On reducing the dislocation of the upper arm.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the upper arm does not become dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is to dislocate toward the side of the little rib below.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is to dislocate towards the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated in the upper part of the arm, which occurs rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	It does not become dislocated at the back because of the blade bone (scapula).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated to the front due to nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	Indeed it is most often dislocated and comes out towards the lower little rib, especially among those whose flesh is scant.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Since it goes out quickly in them, and comes back in quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of that; namely, that it goes out with difficulty and comes back in with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men that there is a blow or fall and the arm becomes dislocated with a hot swelling, and because of this they think it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore it is necessary that you examine it until you stand firm about its certainty, and then proceed with the cure of it.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	A dislocation is recognized when it is towards the lower little rib; and you must distinguish between a dislocated arm and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find between them an evident difference and find in the head of the dislocated arm a hollow, and below the little rib near the touch of the head of the arm as if it were an egg; and the sufferer cannot draw his hand to his ear nor move it with all motions.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	Similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards, you will find a clear swelling that cannot be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	The reduction of this particular dislocation is easily done when it is recent or the patient is a weak child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	The reduction involves having an assistant raise their hand upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under the victim's armpits and lift the shoulder joint with strength upwards into its socket; meanwhile, the assistant lifts their hand and stretches it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Afterwards, place [the arm] down as it indeed returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	However, if it does not return as described and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred: then one should bathe the patient in warm water and apply a softening embrocation that eases pain, such as when boiled roots of althea, fenugreek, and mallow are applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Next the patient should lie on their back; an armpit pad of equal parts soft wool and hard packing should be placed under each armpit.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Next the doctor should place their heel on the pad and lift the head of the shoulder with strength while drawing the patient's arm downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	Another assistant should hold the patient's head to prevent it from moving downwards as it will return immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	If you wish to reduce it this way, then have present a man taller than the patient who stands by their side and inserts his shoulder under the victim's armpit; he lifts up the armpit until the patient is hanging suspended in midair.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	The assistant should pull the patient's hand towards the lower part of their belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If the patient is light, then they should be hung with something else to weigh them down; for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	It is also reduced by another method: a long piece of wood should be fixed into the ground; its head should be round like the handle of a mortar; it should not be too thick nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then place the patient on top of soft cloths that have been placed over the wood, with the patient standing along the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then pull their hand towards the lower part on one side and stretch out their body from the other with strength; for the joint returns to its place swiftly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If all of the above is difficult for its reduction, then use this treatment: take a piece of wood two arms' length long, four fingers wide and as thick as two fingers; it should have a round head to ease its entry into the patient's anus, with this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths should be wrapped around the round head so it does not injure the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place it under the patient's anus so that when their hand or arm is stretched out over the wood down to the lower part, the wood should be tied on top of the assistant, arm and end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm across the step of a ladder and stretch out their hand to the lower part; let the rest of their body hang on the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore its entry has been completed according to whichever method is possible: then it is necessary that you place beneath the tincle a woollen sphere of equal quantity.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the plaster prepared from mill dust with frankincense and egg white over the whole shoulder, just as it is rolled off from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind tightly beneath the tincle with a suitable bandage: and roll the bandage over the plaster from above: and attach his hand to his neck, and let it be left there without moving his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that little food be given to the patient until his limb has regained its strength: because this is quicker for his recovery.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger bandage should be applied after seven or five days, and it should be tightened with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it has become firm and has not softened, then he is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	But if the joint is frequently dislocated due to moisture that affects it or some other cause: then it is necessary that a three-holed caustic be applied as set forth above in the chapter on the cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days, but the joint is not made firm, and the plaster and bandage are reapplied several times without becoming firm, and it falls off and cannot be raised upwards towards his neck: then you should know that its nerves which go to the head of the shoulder have already been cut or stretched or softened; and you should know that this joint will never become fixed in place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But a dislocation that is towards the chest and nipple or one that is reduced to the back is done with thrusting and stretching of the hands until it returns; then the remaining bandage and treatment should be applied until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If there is heaviness after healing in the limb and slowness of movement, then let the patient use the baths many times until that heaviness eases up and returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the cure of elbow dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You should know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty too; it can be dislocated in all directions but primarily forward or backward.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation will not be hidden from you: it falls under sight and touch regardless of the shape it is dislocated into.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join a dislocated elbow to a healthy one, it will be clear to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint will be crushed and unable to bend the arm or touch its shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you must hurry and reduce the dislocation immediately before it gets a hot abscess.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if it gets a hot abscess, its reduction becomes difficult; perhaps it won't heal at all, especially when on the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	It is worse than all other forms of dislocation and has intense pain for them; many times death comes with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration when it is among those that can be reduced is as follows: the patient's hand should be stretched with both hands; their arm should be extended and the doctor's hand placed above and below the elbow, who then pushes the joint with his thumbs together or with the root of his palms until it returns to place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or the dislocation is forward; then he returns and doubles up his hand with his own hand until he strikes the elbow that has been dislocated with the root of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not obey reduction, then administer a violent and very strong extension; it is for two attendants to extend the arm, and for two more attendants also to hold him so that he is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is rotated towards every part after a folded cloth or a wide bandage has been wrapped around his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he anoints it with oil so that it is one of those things which helps to ease the joint and make it supple.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he drives the joint with a violent push until it returns to its place.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction has been accomplished it should be covered with a plaster containing an astringent and drying agent along with egg-white; and it is to be bound with a bandage of suitable tightness.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm should be hung from the patient's neck; and it is to be left for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is to be loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the joint is firmly established in its place, then remove the bandage from it, and dismiss the patient.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the joint is not bound tightly enough, then repeat the plaster and bandage, and dismiss the patient for several days until it is properly bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release him/her.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If he experiences heaviness after the joint is reduced and the dislocation is back in place: then apply moist dressings during bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it improves; or apply to the joint capons' rump fat, that is, rich mutton fat.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bind it, and leave the dressing on day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove the dressing and put him into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When he is sweating, then gently rub the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat the capons' fat dressing once, twice and three times with each entry into the bath until it improves.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, put on it pigeon droppings, moist, heated with butter, and bind it above this.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it eases the pain and returns to its place.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	¶ On the treatment of dislocations by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The hand joint of the arm frequently becomes dislocated.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And its reduction is easy to achieve.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	In contrast, the other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the speed of its reduction should be made within the hour during which it becomes dislocated before the place becomes congested; otherwise, there may occur a hot swelling to him.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	The reduction of its dislocation is done by placing the weak hand Mahassem on a board and have the assistant extend his arm; then place your palm over the prominence of the joint and push it until it returns into place.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider that if the palm has already receded towards the belly of the hand: then the patient should place the back of their hand on a board for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation proceeds towards the back of the hand, then the position of his hand will be intrinsic over the board, i.e., the interior part of his hand is placed upon the board so that the physician's hand falls over the same eminence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, that is good; but if not, then compress it with a poultice that heals abscesses and leave it be without further interference.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if the patient cannot tolerate it and you are unable to achieve reduction after some days have passed but the joint remains in its twisted state; this does no harm to the patient other than softening of the hand such that they can grip nothing: then know that nerves have been either cut or bruised.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no remedy other than binding with a caustic near its end.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it will not bring about any improvement.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	Since therefore it does not return to the correct position, place over it the poultice that we described earlier.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it should be bound up and left for five days; afterwards, it is released and the patient's hand is allowed to move freely again.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however its motion is lost and there is any sense of gravity upon it; then ease it with warm water and gentle friction several times until the tension is eased.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When any finger is dislocated in any direction, or towards the back of the palm, or towards its belly; then extend the finger and push on the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns to its proper position.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Hold the head of the finger and suspend it towards the side to which it is dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend the finger and extend it until it becomes straight again on its own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When night falls, bandage it according to the description given; and do not cease to loosen the bandage during the day; exercise the finger with movement; and re-bandage it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days until the finger is stiff.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with it if it is dislocated towards the belly of the hand; and bind it to that side, and carry out your first procedure until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do likewise with it when it is dislocated towards the other sides.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the treatment of dislocations of the vertebrae in the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When someone has a complete dislocation of the vertebrae in the back or neck, or when many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, then there is no cure since death hastens to the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the sick person's ejection occurs involuntarily and they cannot hold it back; and often some parts of their body become weak due to this, or both legs, or both arms, or one of them, or a single vertebra moves out of place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	The wound is frequently moved, which causes frequent dislodgement into four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is displaced to the rear is called gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment for it is that you must consider then if gibbosity occurs during childhood; there is no cure and no healing can come of it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	In that which occurs from a fall or blow or similar causes, the ancients have already spoken at length about methods of treatment.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which very little returns with benefit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I myself have now shortened it from that which was excused little enough for much of its proximity to my intention: and by the exposition I made when presenting that one, and formed an instrument differently from how they showed it, and presented it thus.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore that there is no skill or healing to be had from a gibbosity occurring from the front.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And likewise, for that which occurs on two sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it cannot be cured from these except that which occurs on the back specifically, as I relate: and let the sick person be laid face down on a level bench near to a wall; and a damp cloth should be spread underneath them so their chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight pole should be placed fixed into the earth at one end of the bench about where their head is; and another pole should be placed about where their feet are at the other end of the bench; and an assistant holds this latter pole without it being secured firmly into the ground.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And one assistant holds the other (instrument).
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then roll it over the patient's head, and under their armpits tie a soft yet strong bandage; extend the end of the bandage to the wooden support by his head, and secure it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tighten another bandage over their hips, above their knees, and at their calves.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages together, and secure them to another wooden support at their feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then each assistant should take a side of the wooden support and the bandage, but make sure that neither wooden support is moved from its fixed position as we described before.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	The physician should place their palms on the patient's spine with strength until it returns to normal; or they can use a board instead.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then the physician should attach their feet to the board until it returns to normal.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If this treatment does not work, then get another board that is about three arms' lengths in length.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And the wooden peg we mentioned before that is near the patient should be placed into the wall at the point where the end of the board can rest on it.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board over their spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the physician should put their feet on the other end of the board.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	They should tighten it well until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a tool that is wrapped around your hand; and this is how it is done: embed into the ground by their head at the very end of the bed two pieces of wood each one arm's length long; and do likewise at their feet.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	The length between all the wood should be a span long: and now having made a hole at each place where the lathe passes through: fasten down firmly all the timber into the ground so it cannot move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	Insert the round wood: and there is the lathe which revolves with its string through two holes of two woods.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it is a hole where the wood is fixed with its length being equal to one span and what it revolves with: and similarly there are two other woods that also have this feature.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the strings that you have tightened on the patient's chest to the lathe by their head: and those that are tied around their legs to the one at their feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then have a helper stand by each lathe to turn the handle with which the lathe revolves: and let the physician adjust the vertebrae as we said before.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the shape of the lathe that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the vertebrae return and the place is levelled, it is necessary to apply a dry plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then a bandage.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	After that apply over the plaster some thin strips of wood about three fingers wide or close to it.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And the length should be enough to cover the hunchback's bump as well as a healthy portion of their vertebrae above it.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then bind them with the string that we mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the patient be given light nourishment until they heal.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If anything remains prominent at the site as the healing ends: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered with the application of the board we described over a long period.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a lead plate is applied to it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes there is a prominence at the very end of the spine: and this is thought to be caused by a dislocation, and it is that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why should one not presume that this medicine will be applied to him: for it may indeed cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	On the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that a dislocation is the only injury which occurs in the ankle and shoulder joints; nor does it occur to them as it does with other joints due to minor displacement or concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	The ankle joint is indeed dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Which is to say it is dislocated forwards and backwards.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	It most commonly dislocates inwards: and it rarely dislocates forwards or backwards.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	The treatment of its inward dislocation is as follows: for when you join the healthy leg with that of the patient, it is longer; and his knee is more prominent than that of a healthy person, and he cannot flex his foot at the hip: and there is swelling in the area below the hip due to the head of the femur having reached this point.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	The sign that it has dislocated outwards is that its symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	The sign of a dislocation to the front is that they extend their healthy leg fully but cannot do so without pain at the knee; and when trying to walk they cannot step forward on it; moreover, urine retention occurs and there may be swelling in the groin region, and during walking they strike the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	The sign of a dislocation to the rear is that they cannot extend their knee nor flex it before flexing the groin; also their leg will be shortened compared with the other one; and the groin area will feel softened and there will be hip pain near the point of the buttock.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	Reduction of these types of dislocations is done by considering whether the dislocation is old and has been there for some time or not.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you reduce the dislocation and it remains so after the procedure then there is no cure for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore one should not assume that it cannot be done.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In the case of a fresh dislocation, which is one of the four types of dislocation, you should hurry to roll the joint and extend it inwards and outwards while moving it left and right; perhaps it will go back into place and then not require any further treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If it does not go back into place in this way then you must prepare a strong assistant to extend their leg from the lower part either with his hands or with a bandage tied above their knee; another assistant will extend the patient's hand from above and insert his hands under the patient's toes.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then bind gently with a bandage over the hip joint and hold the end of the other bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	Its extension is either from the front part of the groin to the fork region or from behind to the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let their extension be with one force until the patient is raised from the ground with his body, and he remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is a common type among four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then for every type, what I say about its own treatment is necessary.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Indeed, in its proper reduction when the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that the patient lie on his back on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then place a bandage over the root of the hip bone, at that which is between the hip head and the area beneath the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin area to the higher part of the body, towards the fork region.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong helper takes his arms, reduces the thick area of the affected hip, and extends it outward with a forceful extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now indeed it has returned to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is the easiest among other types of treatment by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it slips from you and does not obey you to go in with this type of treatment at all, then the two feet of the patient should be bound together with a strong yet gentle bandage over the two heels and over the two knees; and its length is that of four fingers long for each. And let the affected leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the patient should be hung upside down over the head of the wooden pole that is inside the house; and its length from the ground to the top should be equal to twice the length of an arm.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Next instruct a strong young man to secure the head of the thigh; and let another be found who will hang with the patient; and let this other young man push with strength while securing the thigh, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	However when it is returning to its proper place and the joint has been dislocated outwards, then the patient must lie on a couch as we have described for one with a hunchback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And the bandage should be wrapped over their leg as well as above their chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two wooden poles should be placed; one near the patient's feet and another near their head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Next an additional wooden pole should be placed and firmly fixed to the middle of the couch; over this wet cloth should be wrapped so as not to hurt the patient; and let the pole be between their thighs such that it prevents them from being pulled towards their feet when being stretched out.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then each helper should pull in their direction; while the physician steadies the patient with his hand to guide the repositioning.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If it therefore follows this process of returning [to its proper place], then there will be good [results].
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if it does not [follow this process], then place them on the same board as before; and press down on their spine evenly as we described for treating hunchbacks.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However the patient should lie on their healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is forward then it is necessary for the patient's leg to be quickly stretched out; and again this should take place on a couch as previously described; and the physician will place the palm of their right hand over the patient's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he grasps it with one hand and, while holding it fast, places it extended downwards towards the lower region of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is backwards: then it should not be necessary to extend the patient downwards and raise them up from the ground; instead, they should be placed on a hard surface, just as one would do in the case of their hip being dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about having them lie on two hips, facing down with ligaments extended, as mentioned previously.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary to apply compression with a board over the place where the joint comes out once the reduction is complete as required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return will not be hidden from you: this is when you extend the patient's two legs and, upon seeing them equal in length, and the patient tightening their leg and stretching it without discomfort; then you know that the limb has returned as it should. Then join the two thighs together, apply a plaster cast, and tighten with imemati, that is, a tourniquet, so that the hip does not move at all: and have the patient rest for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then untie the ligaments and remove the plaster cast, comparing the leg with the other one: then, if you see them equal in length, know that the dislocation is now firmly set; therefore, allow the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening in it, then return and plaster it again, tightening it according to your original method; and leave it for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then untie it and have the patient delay their walking on both legs for a few days until it is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	The dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, that is, backwards.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you tell the patient to apply their leg to their hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not adhere to the hip, then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	The restoration of all ways of its dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright so they can already stretch their leg on it if possible and have your back adhere to their face, and put their foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make their knee adhere to your palms and straighten them between your fingers over their knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with the palm of your hand both sides of their knee forcefully.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another helper stretches the patient's foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of it returning is that the leg adheres to the hip gently without strain.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then bandage them and make their leg adhere to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind it with wool for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen the bindings.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the patient not walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, you are refused its reduction, then apply a strong extension with the ligaments, whose preceding description was given in the treatment of dislocated hip, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	The treatment of calcaneal dislocation.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus is sometimes dislocated by a slight force, and sometimes it is dislocated along its length.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either internally or externally.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	The sign of its dislocation is that you see the calcaneus swollen, proceeding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The cure for its dislocation is an easy return: it must be extended with ease by hand and made even until it returns to its place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In its treatment when it is dislocated along its length, you must have the patient sit upright: and let a strong assistant hold him firmly from behind at the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you hold with your right hand his foot from above, and with your left hand below the place of the dislocation on his foot.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then, pull it with two fingers of your left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left (hand) and push the sole of his foot towards the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do it twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the sole of his foot towards the leg with your third finger, and you draw the dislocation.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns to the same vein or two according to this manner and you see that the foot is equalized, it is good; if not, then repeat the operation on it because it will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however you are prevented from reducing it with what we have described: then make the patient lie on their back on the ground and fix a stake firmly into the earth so that it falls between their thighs; and now wrap a cloth around them to prevent injury to the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Next, have an assistant take their thigh; then the other assistant extends their foot either with their hands or with a cord that is tied around the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then have each assistant stretch against the stretching of their partner; and let the stake stand between the patient's two thighs holding them so that they are not pulled down towards their feet during the stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician should equalize the dislocation with their hands, while another assistant holds the healthy leg down towards the feet.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For a dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns and you see that it has healed, then apply a plaster and bandage and bind them tightly with cords, and tie the foot to their leg with a cord.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And you must be cautious or fearful about the nerves which are above the back of the heel so that the cord is not too tight and injures them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then discharge him after two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If however the cord loosens, tighten it; then release him on the third or fourth day and prevent the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If he attempts to walk before that time, it is not safe that the dislocation will not dissolve and be corrupted, and it will not accept treatment thereafter.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If a hot abscess occurs to him: then you ought to administer to its reduction that which our previous account prescribed elsewhere for treatment, and an embrocation until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On the dislocation of the toes of the foot and its cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what has been dislocated from them be reduced with a little extension without effort; and this indeed is not difficult but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If, however, the dislocation is at some of the joints of the sole of the foot: then the sick person ought to make his foot sit on an equal spot of the ground or on a board; and he must stand like one walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and place your foot on that which is prominent among those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with force until it returns, and see that it is now reduced, and no prominence appears in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under his foot a board that receives the whole foot; it should have two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it and make him rest from walking for many days until he is bound and secured by the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On types of dislocation with a wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens from that and you attempt its treatment and its restoration, death often succeeds; and because of this, it is not appropriate to presume over the treatment of such a condition unless one is wise in art, long-practiced, merciful, pious, slow, not audacious, nor presumptuous: and so that they use at the outset medicines which cool hot abscesses only: and leave the sick person to divine judgement.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see or hope for salvation from ruin with the easing of illness, and where there is some sign of hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Attempt therefore to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the condition before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the limb returns according to our wish, then administer a regime that cools the abscess; and treat the wound with what is appropriate to it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If there is dislocation with a fracture and separate cracks occur in the bone, then attempt their removal, and do what we said for simple illnesses regarding those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear; as was said in my sermon to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and safer for your body among them during your lifetime.
