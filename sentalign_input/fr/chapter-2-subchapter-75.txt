Of childbirth
First, the midwife must know the appearance of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pushing downward and wanting to smell something: then the child is about to come out; then know that this childbirth is according to the natural figure, and the exit is under its head, and the afterbirth with it; when you see these signs, gently press her belly so that the child comes out quickly; for when it descends on its head, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its superfluities by good purification; and those that come otherwise are not natural. For it sometimes comes on its feet, and the body or head comes out, and the hands, or it comes on its belly, or often, and it is sometimes turned on its neck, and other bad positions; so the midwife must be wise and skilled in these things, and avoid errors and deception, and I will show you all the positions and how to assist.
If the child comes on its head by natural exit, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, make her sit on a stool, or have women hold her; and moisten her genitals with oil or cooked fenugreek, then place between her fingers the small spatula of this shape:
and cut the afterbirth, and tear it with your nail until the moisture inside runs out; press the woman’s belly until the child descends, and if it does not descend, give the woman an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil; then make her hold her breath and sneeze with condisi, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: the child will come out now. If the two hands come out, gently push them back little by little; if they cannot go back in, place the woman on a seat, and lift her feet up; then lower the seat to the ground, and hold the woman so she does not fall when lowering; if the hands cannot go back in, and the child dies, cut the hands with the knife previously mentioned, extract the child, and reassemble it properly.
Of the birth of the child feet first
When the child comes feet first, you must push it upward;
and then turn it little by little, until it is aligned;
then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When it reaches the thighs, command her to hold her breath, and make her sneeze with condiments;
then it will come out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is in the natural position.
For then it will come out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then take marshmallow mucilage, sesame oil, and melted gum, and grind it all in a mortar;
and put this ointment inside and outside the woman’s genitals,
then make her sit in warm water up to her ribs;
and when she is softened below, make a necklace of myrrh for her, put it below, and leave it for an hour;
then make her sit on a seat, make her sneeze and pinch her mouth and nose, and press her belly gently, for the child will come out now.
Of the birth of the child knees first
When the child comes in this form, the midwife should place her hands little by little;
then support her by her neck, and let her feet hang down, and let her lie on a bed;
and fold her hands little by little, and then place her hands on her belly, and remove the cushions from underneath, until she is positioned downward;
and if the child does not come out, take her feet and move them firmly, then move her belly upward, then put your hands in;
and extract the child little by little; and command the woman to hold her breath until the child comes out.
Of the birth of the child with one hand hanging out
You must skillfully bring the hand back:
if it cannot be brought back, make the woman stand up, and walk;
if she cannot walk, make her lie on a bed, and spread her legs firmly;
then administer the mucilage I have mentioned;
and if she does not give birth, make her sit on a seat, then carefully bring back the hand;
and extract the child according to the natural position, and make her sneeze, and command her to hold her breath until the child comes out.
Of the birth of the child with its neck first, and its hands spread, and its face turned toward its mother's back
The midwife must hold her hand, then turn it little by little, and extract it gently;
and when it is aligned, put marshmallow mucilage and oil on her genitals, as we have said, then command her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, make her sit on a seat, and command her to hold her breath; and make her sneeze.
Of this same manner with the afterbirth
When it comes out in this manner with the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your nail, until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the umbilical cord, so it is not retained, and the child dies;
then put the child back in, until you have placed it as it should be, and command the woman to hold her breath a few times:
then it will come out easily.
Of the birth of twins
Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, though it rarely happens.
Two are a strange thing, and they rarely live;
I know this, that they are multiplied, and are separated by the membrane that divides them, which is attached to the umbilical cord;
and sometimes they come out as naturally as a single child, as we have said.
And if they come out with difficulty, treat it as we have said, and let the midwife be skillful, and do quickly and lightly what she must do;
and do as best as possible for the safety of all.
Of multiple births
Sometimes one or two or three or four or five or six or seven, or more up to fifteen children are formed in the uterus, and they are all formed in the shape of a child by the measurement of the glorious sage,
and the midwife must know all this, for perhaps such a thing may happen to her;
so do as necessary.
