Tentigo is an extra growth of flesh on the genitals, so much so that it is very ugly to see; and some women have it as big as a hand, and this is the treatment.

and there is another growth that arises at the opening of the vagina, and fills it, and sometimes protrudes, and has the appearance of a tail, and therefore the ancients called it "tailed malady". So you must cut it, as we have described for the tentigo, and treat it until it is healed.	As to the fleshy growth, that is, flesh growing in the cervix and filling it, and also often protruding like a tail (on which account some of the Ancients called it 'caudate disease'); this too you should cut away as you do for the clitoris, and dress until healed.	0.70450634
