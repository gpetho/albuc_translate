When cold and much humidity come to the stomach, causing it to deviate from its usual condition and this leads to a thickening of the tissues, and if you continue the usual treatments without success, then the patient should lie on their back, extending their arms and legs, and then cauterize with three cauteries: one below the chest the width of a finger with a pointed cautery, and two cauteries below on both sides of the first cautery, forming a triangular shape; and space them so they are not too close together to avoid causing putrefaction.	When cold and many humidities get into the stomach, so that its constitution is disturbed and much fluxion has come to it, and a variety of treatment has been tried to no effect, the patient must be put on his back with legs and arms outstretched; then give him a threefold cauterization: one a finger's breadth below the hollow of the chest with the claviform cautery; and two below and to the sides of the first cauterization, so that it has a triangular appearance; but there should be some distance between each lest they run together when suppuration sets in.	0.8676423
And the depth of the cautery should be two-thirds the thickness of the tendon.	Let the depth of the burning be two-thirds of the depth of the skin.	0.7173568
And let the figure of the cautery be in this form without addition. If you prefer, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach in this form; and let this be a circular cautery in this form:	Let the shape of the cauterizations be thus and of no more than this size. If you wish, make a single large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, thus. The cautery for this single cauterization is circular, thus.	0.8194353
And let the stomach be cauterized with pointed cautery for those afraid of this cautery: mark points on the stomach according to the amount needed, and then cauterize with the pointed cautery; and then treat it with the previously described method until healed.	The stomach may be cauterized with punctures in the case of a person who fears this operation. You will have marked the points with ink on the stomach, as many as you wish; then sear with a punctate cautery. Then treat as previously described until he be healed.	0.8153225
