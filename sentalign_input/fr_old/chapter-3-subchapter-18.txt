Of the fracture of the wrist bone
When the bone of a woman's pelvis is fractured, have her sit with her legs spread, then lean her back and support her from behind; then fill her vaginal canal with cotton, and insert as much as the size of a fist; then stand her up, and gradually lift her back, and the cotton will push the bone back into place. When she needs to urinate, remove the cotton, and after urinating, replace it, and do this for seven days or so: the fracture will be restored. If you prefer, take a sheepâ€™s bladder, attach a tube to the opening, and insert the entire bladder into the vagina; then blow into the tube forcefully until the bladder inflates inside: this will reposition the bone; then fill it with cotton, and leave it for a few days, until it is healed.
And when the wrist bone of a man or woman is fractured, restore it as we have said for the hip bone; and these fractures are not hidden from one who studies and practices this, and understands my book. For the fracture itself shows in many ways the proper method of restoration: therefore, understand it.
In the case of a fractured penis, take a goose neck and insert the penis into it; then wrap it with cloths, and leave it for three days or so, and it will heal quickly.
