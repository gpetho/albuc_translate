Chapter eighty-seven on the amputation of limbs and sawing of bones	CHAPTER EIGHTY-SEVEN. On the amputation of limbs and the sawing-off of bones.	0.8556694
The extremities may rot, either from an external cause or from an internal cause.	Sometimes the extremities become gangrenous, either from an external or an internal cause.	0.7212476
If you treat this corruption with medical treatment and the treatment does not succeed, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing stopping it, then it is necessary to amputate that limb to the point where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved thereby from death or from a great affliction that is greater than the loss of the limb.	Now when you have treated this disease by medical means, ineffectively, and you see that the disease is spreading over the limb and nothing will stop it, you must cut off that limb as far as the disease has spread, so that the patient may escape death or great affliction, greater than the loss of the limb.	0.8270786
And the sign of whoever is afflicted with this is that the limb blackens until you think that fire has burned it, or it rots after blackening until that rot spreads to what is next to that limb and takes over the whole body, so hasten to amputate it.	Now the sign of the victim of this state is that the limb goes black, so that you might think it were burnt with fire, or, after the blackening, it putrefies, and the putrefaction spreads to parts adjacent to that limb and begins to attack the whole body; cut it away as soon as you can.	0.8202781
And likewise, if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of some vermin, such as a sea scorpion, a viper, a tarantula, and the like.	So must you do if the disease is caused by the bite of some dangerous reptile such as the marine scorpion, viper, or venomous spider, and so on.	0.6937472
If the corruption or the sting is at the tip of the finger, then amputate the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.	If the disease or bite be at the tip of the finger, cut off the finger, giving the disease no opportunity to spread to the rest of the hand.	0.8180751
And likewise, if it has taken hold in the hand, then amputate it from the base of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it takes hold in both bones of the forearm.	Similarly, if it attacks the hand, cut if off at the wrist, giving the disease no opportunity to spread and attack the two bones of the forearm.	0.74976265
And likewise, if it has taken hold in the forearm, then amputate the forearm at the elbow in the joint itself.	Similarly, if it attacks the forearm, cut it off at the elbow through the joint itself.	0.79598397
If the corruption has passed and you see that it has taken hold towards the shoulder, then do not amputate the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient, and use other treatment according to the ability.	If the disease passes onward and you perceive that it has reached the region of the shoulder, by no means cut the shoulder, for that will be the death of the patient; use any treatment but that, as best you may.	0.80325115
And likewise you do with the foot if the corruption has taken hold in the toe, then amputate the toe at one of the phalanges.	In the same manner act in regard to the foot when the disease attacks a toe; namely, amputate the toe through one of the interphalangeal joints.	0.73530483
And if it has taken hold in the metatarsal of the foot, then amputate the entire foot. If it has ascended to the knee, then amputate the leg at the knee joint.	If the disease attacks the tarsus then amputate the whole foot; and if it ascends toward the knee, amputate the leg at the knee-joint.	0.77314836
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, then there is no recourse but to leave it and surrender the patient to death.	If it be that the disease has passed on above the knee, there is nothing of any avail in this case but to leave it, and for the patient to resign himself to death.	0.7798702
The method of amputating or dissecting the limb is to tie a bandage at the bottom of the place you want to amputate and tie another bandage above the place, and an assistant stretches one bandage downwards and another assistant stretches the upper bandage upwards, and you strip the flesh between the two bandages with a wide scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then it is cut or dissected.	Now the way to amputate or saw off a limb is to bind a ligature round below the site and another above; an assistant draws the one downward and another assistant draws the upper ligature upward; while you dissect away the tissues between the two ligatures with a broad scalpel until it is laid bare of flesh; then it should be cut or sawn.	0.87773716
And it is necessary to place linen rags on all sides so that the saw does not touch the healthy area, causing the patient additional pain and a hot swelling.	You must place linen dressings on every side lest the saw touch a part that is sound and thus cause the patient additional pain and inflammation.	0.8446846
If bleeding occurs during your work, cauterize the area quickly or apply some blood-stopping powders, then return to your treatment until you are finished, then bandage the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals.	If a haemorrhage occurs while you are operating, cauterize the place as quickly as possible, or apply to it one or other of the styptic powders; then continue until finished. Then bind up the mutilated limb with a suitable bandage and dress until healed.	0.8187152
And I will tell you an example of a man who suffered in his leg this very same condition that I am describing to you, and that is that blackness occurred in his leg with a burning sensation resembling fire, and that corruption first occurred in his toe until it took over the entire foot, so the man, on his own initiative, when he saw the corruption spreading in the limb, with the intensity of the pain and burning he was experiencing, amputated it at the joint and recovered.	Now I shall relate to you an example; what I am going to tell you is exactly what happened to a certain man's foot. He had a blackening of the foot, with a burning like that of fire. The disease, to begin with, was in one toe, but it went on to involve the whole foot. When the man saw the disease spreading in the limb and felt the violent pain and burning, he hastened of his own accord to amputate it at the joint, and he got better.	0.865506
Then, after a long time had passed, this same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand, so he came to me and I tried to stop that excess with the medicines I applied to the hand after cleaning his body, but the excess was not deterred and it began to spread to the other finger until the corruption took hold in the hand, so he called on me to amputate his hand, but I refused him, hoping to stop that excess and also fearing death for him if his hand were amputated, because the man's strength was failing.	After a long time had passed the very same kind of disease arose in the forefinger of his hand. He came to me, and I attempted to suppress the superfluity with remedies that I applied to the hand, after purging his body; but the superfluity was not to be suppressed and began to spread to the second finger, and eventually the whole hand was involved in the disease. He urged me to cut off his hand, but I did not wish to do this, hoping I should be able to overcome the superfluity, and also fearing he would die at the amputation of his hand, for the man's strength was on the decline.	0.8800075
So when he despaired of me, he returned to his town, and I heard about him that he, on his own initiative, amputated his entire hand and recovered.	When he despaired of me he went back to his own country, and I then heard that he had gone and cut off his whole hand, and got well.	0.8248848
I have only told this story to be a help in what occurs of this type of disease and to be a guide to be followed and acted upon.	I narrate this story as help against this kind of malady when it occurs; and as guidance for you to take and act upon.	0.8118061
