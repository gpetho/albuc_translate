of cupping bloodletting
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or brass, or glass; and cupping is done in two ways: either by lancing and drawing blood, or without lancing.
And this cupping which is done without lancing is of two kinds: either it is with fire, or without fire; and cupping which is done by lancing and drawing blood is done in fourteen places on the body, one of which is at the very top of the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping glass under the chin; and the cupping glass on the two shoulders; and the cupping glass on the buttocks; and the cupping glasses in the middle of the two arms; and the cupping glasses on the two legs; and the cupping glasses on the two ankles; and cupping does not draw blood, except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and therefore one is not weakened by it, as one is by bleeding a vein; and it should not be administered, either with fire or without fire, in any illness that comes from plethora, until the whole body is emptied.
And if by necessity of illness it is necessary to cup, or by habit, we administer it every time at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between and at any time; for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head; and there are some who find fullness and redness in their face, and in their head, and in the neck, and darkness in their eyes; and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and cough up blood; and there are some who dream, and see by night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we order cupping after three hours of daylight. 
Bleeding from the nose helps with severe headache... that affects the eyes, and it should not be done after a full body purge; and this cupping is in place of bleeding from the cephalic vein, and those of a cold complexion should not use it, nor those who have catarrh, because it causes them great harm; and therefore the elderly should not use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And he who bleeds from it often, becomes forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping glass a little lower down for fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the middle of the neck is in place of bleeding from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for tightness of the chest, and for splitting of the bronchial tube, and for cough, and for fullness; and it should be applied lightly, because if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness or problems in the stomach and heart. 
Cupping on the two sides of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraine, and for choking, and for pain in the roots of the teeth, and it is in place of bleeding from the basilic vein; and you must instruct the person cupping to press his hand upon application so that he does not cut the artery and cause bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is good for diseases of the mouth, and for corruption of the gums, and similar ailments that are in the mouth; and it is in place of bleeding from the two lips.
Cupping on the shoulders is good for illness that comes from heat and fullness.
Cupping on the elbows is worth as much as bleeding from the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from these large veins; and instruct the cupper not to strike too deeply, for the place is bare of flesh, and there are nerves and arteries underneath.
The cupping glass that is placed on the buttock is good for hemorrhoids of the anus and illnesses below, and it is necessary that the cupping glass be large, and made of brass, as it needs to draw strongly; and perhaps, if it were thin, it would break; and make large wounds there.
Cupping glasses on the legs bleed readily, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the loins, and of the marrow, and of the bladder, and eliminate menstrual flow; and are in place of the two saphenous veins, and the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in many situations.
The way to apply the cupping glass is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not stop doing this until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears; then strike, and replace the cupping glasses, and pay attention to the constitution of the body, for there are some who have tender flesh, and open pores: so it is necessary to strike only once, and make wide wounds, and a little deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to thin the pathway of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time; and when we want to draw blood little by little, it is enough to strike only once.
And if we want a lot of blood, we start again often; and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the limit is that the skin be pierced suddenly, and for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, you should anoint the places for the cupping glasses with opening and dissolving oil: if it is in summer, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or oil of cucumber seed; and if it is in winter, with watercress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, take oil of marjoram, or of balsamite, or oil of dill, and similar ones.
And if the one being treated has tender flesh and large pores, no oil should be applied, but they should be washed after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or cucumber water, or purslane water, or similar.
And he who has a lot of moisture, let him rise with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities rise with old wine, or elder water, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar things; and one should not be cupped before the bath nor in the bath, but after the bath for an hour or two; and should not sleep after cupping, and it is necessary that he be careful, when he is to be cupped and when he has been cupped.
And be wary if the one being treated is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then he must take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces with vinegar, and similar things; and eat chicks, and mutton, and moist foods.
And he who has a cold complexion, let him take honey syrup, and moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat chicks and small birds and pigeons; and the day he is cupped, he should drink more than he eats; and it is necessary to sometimes give some men theriac or nutmeg before cupping, or after, to strengthen the principal members; and let the blood be thinned, but it is not necessary that those who are warm drink it.
The cups that are placed without scarification are those that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen, and for gout, and on the belly and the buttock and the loins and the hip, because these parts do not tolerate scarification on the eyes, and it is only done with fire to draw blood from one part to another, as we place them on the breasts when the nose bleeds; to remove the viscosity that is in the part, as we place cups on the belly and on the buttocks to reduce the part; and remove the pain, when there is blockage or stone, thus it removes by its attractive power perhaps the blockage, or loosens the stone from its place; and so it does when it is placed on the liver and on the spleen when there is retained wind, and these cups are applied empty to only suck; and sometimes they are applied together with fire, and sometimes filled with lukewarm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a way that the cup is filled with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled for this.
The method of cupping applied with fire is as follows:
And it should be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and have on the side around the middle a small hole, just enough to insert a needle, and be made of brass, smooth in front so that it does not hurt the patient when placed on the limb; and have in the middle a crossbar of brass or iron, to place a lit candle, and they should be both large and small according to the illnesses and the age of those who receive them; for the cups for children are different than for the old, and for the thin than for the fat.
And one should place this cup on the limb thus: take the candle of wax or a wick, and place it in the middle of the cup across the bar which is in the middle of the cup, so that the flame is at the bottom of the cup so that it does not burn the patient; and then place it on the limb, and your finger should be on the hole that we mentioned, so that when one wants, the vapor escapes, and one removes the cup; and one takes the wick as before, and repeats it often, if you have need.
In the cup then which is applied in the illness of pleurisy, with only water, there is no bar nor hole, and fire is not used except when it is full of water, and it is placed on the limb only; and this is the method:
