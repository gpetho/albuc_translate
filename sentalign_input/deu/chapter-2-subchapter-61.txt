Chapter 61.
On the extraction of stones in women.
Stones in women are rarely formed.
But if a woman does develop stones, the treatment is difficult and hindered in many ways.
One reason is that a woman can easily become virgin again.
The second reason is that you rarely find a woman knowledgeable enough to expose herself to a physician whether she is chaste or married.
The third reason is that you do not find many women who know this art, especially the manual operation.
The fourth reason is that the site for incision in women is far from the stone, requiring a deep incision, which is frightening.
But if necessity compels you to this, you must find a knowledgeable female physician, who is rare.
But if you lack one, seek a skilled and subtle midwife, or present a well-instructed matron in women's matters, or a woman who has recently learned this art.
Then bring her forward, and command her to do everything you instruct, starting with the investigation of the stone; if the woman is a virgin, she must put her finger in her anus and seek the stone.
If she finds it, she must hold it with her finger, and then you instruct her to make an incision over it.
But if she is not a virgin, instruct the matron to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone while placing her left hand on the bladder, pressing firmly.
If she finds it, she must carefully move it from the bladder opening downward with the utmost care until it reaches the root of the thigh.
Then make an incision at the middle of the vagina near the root of the thigh on whichever side the stone is located, and the finger must not be removed from the stone, holding it below.
The incision should be small at first; then insert the probe into the incision, and if you feel the stone, adjust the incision according to the size needed to extract the stone.
And know that there are many types of stones: some are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and with branches.
So you should know the types to determine the best approach.
If you see blood flow, apply powdered vitriol to the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then resume the operation until the stone is extracted.
Prepare the instruments mentioned for extracting stones in men, to assist you in the operation.
If you see blood flow, and know that it is from the artery being cut, then apply powder to the area and tighten it with bandages and pressure, do not repeat it; leave the stone and do not extract it, as the patient may die.
Then treat the wound.
When the bleeding has stopped after a few days, and the area has healed, you can return to the operation until the stone is extracted.
