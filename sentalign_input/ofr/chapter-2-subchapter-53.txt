of the canker/ulcer
We have spoken in the division about the appearances of a canker/ulcer, and how one should work on it with medicines, and how one should avoid treatment with iron/surgery;
and we say the canker/ulcer degenerates into necrosis, and great caution is needed in the treatment, and the ancients said that when a canker/ulcer is in a place where it can be scraped, like a canker/ulcer that is in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, it should be completely removed when it is in the beginning;
and when it is large and old, you should not approach it, because I have never been able to heal any;
nor has anyone ever healed one before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you sometimes purge the patient of black bile;
then have them bled if there is manifest plethora, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the procedure;
then cast your hooks or pincers, and pull it from all sides, and remove it completely without leaving anything behind;
and let the blood flow freely, and press the area well with your hand or something else, and if the flow of blood prevents you from incising the artery or vein, cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped;
then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
