Regarding gangrene
The flesh rots either due to an internal cause or an external cause;
and when you have treated that corrosion with medicines, and it does not improve,
it is necessary to cut that member up to the place where the corrosion reaches,
so that the patient escapes death, or the greater harm, which is the loss of the member;
and the signs are that the member becomes black, as if it were burnt by fire,
and rots after blackening, then the corrosion goes from member to member,
and spreads throughout the body; so hurry to cut,
and if it is due to the bite of some venomous creatures, like sea scorpion and viper and similar,
if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it, and do not allow it to spread to the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it reaches the arm, cut it at the elbow; and if it passes the elbow, it is death,
and no treatment helps except the amount of its strength;
and do the same when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the next joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut the whole foot;
and if it goes up the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it goes above the knee, there is no other means but to leave the patient to die;
and the manner of cutting or sawing the member is that you tie it above and below,
and one assistant stretches one tie downwards, and another assistant the other tie upwards,
and you separate the flesh between the two ties to a spatula's width, until the bone is uncovered;
then cut or saw it, and place a linen cloth on each side, so that the saw does not touch the healthy place,
and does not cause another lesion and hot abscess to the patient.
And if blood flow comes when you work, cauterize the place quickly,
or apply some restraining powders; then return to your medicine until it is complete,
then tie the wounded member with an appropriate bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you what happened to a man with his foot:
he had a blackness that seemed like a burn from fire,
and that corrosion first came to his toe, until it covered the whole foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut the foot, and was healed;
and long after the corrosion returned to his finger, and he came to me,
and I applied repellent things after cleaning the body, and the corrosion could not be stopped;
and he wanted me to cut his hand, and I did not want to, as I hoped to repel the matter;
and I also feared that if I cut his hand, he would die,
because the man's strength was weak; and he despaired completely, and returned to his land,
and hastened to cut his hand, and was healed;
and I have told this story so that others may do the same, if needed.
