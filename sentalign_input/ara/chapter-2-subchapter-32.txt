Chapter Thirty-Two.
On sawing teeth that have grown over others.
When molars grow in other than their natural course, they make the appearance ugly, especially if this happens in women and slaves. So you should examine them. If the molar has grown behind another molar,
and sawing it or filing it down is not possible, then extract it. If it is attached to another molar, cut it with this instrument, which is pictured here:
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian steel, very sharp at the tip. You should cut it over the course of several days, due to the hardness of the tooth and so as not to loosen other molars. But if it is protruding in a way that allows filing, file it with a file made of Indian steel, which is pictured here.
It should be entirely made of Indian steel and its cutting edge should be very finely engraved, like the file used for making needles. File the tooth with it a little at a time, gently over several days, so you don't loosen the tooth and cause it to fall out. Then, finally, smooth and polish it with a polisher.
If a part of a molar has broken off and it hurts the tongue when speaking, you should also file it down until the roughness of the break is gone and it becomes even and smooth and doesn't hurt the tongue or impede speech.
