Chapter twenty-three on cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If moistures prevail over the trachea, especially if that is with a cold temperament, then the sick person should first vomit using laxative medications.
Then cauterize him with a cautery in the pit of the jugular vein at the base of the larynx in the low place, but be careful not to reach the larynx with the cautery, and do not burn more than half of the skin.
Then cauterize him with another cautery at the joint of the neck at the last vertebra of it, intensely, and the cautery should be nail-shaped according to the description that preceded.
Then treat him with what was mentioned previously until he recovers, God willing.
