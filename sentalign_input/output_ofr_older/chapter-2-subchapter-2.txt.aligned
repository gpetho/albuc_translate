When someone has an illness called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the illness is chronic, and medical treatments do not help, then the last resort is cautery along with cutting the two arteries.	When a person gets painful defluxions into the eyes or chest which become chronic, and medical treatment is ineffectual in this case, then section of these arteries will be the most efficacious treatment.	0.6367864
Therefore, when you want to cut them, have the patient tilt their head back; then rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens their neck with a cloth; then observe where the veins pulse, and the locations of both are behind the ears, and they are slightly hidden; then mark the locations, and cut both with a sharp two-edged spatula, so that the cut reaches the bone, and this should be done across the width of the head.	When you decide on section, you should shave the patient's head with a razor; then rub the place with a rough cloth to show up the artery; then bind the patient's neck with an end of his garment; then you will observe where the artery is pulsating (the sites of both are the depressions behind the ears) for it is uncommon for them to remain hidden, except in a few persons. Then do you mark with ink over both; then cut with a hooked scalpel, cutting down to the bone; the incision should be lateral to the head.	0.83144426
And if you want, place the spatula under the artery and cut it from above, cutting as if two fingers width across.	Or if you prefer, introduce the scalpel beneath the artery and make a thrusting cut up at it. The incision should be of about two fingers' breadth.	0.782589
And when the vein is cut, the blood will continuously spurt out upwards.	When cut, the artery gives out a pulsating jet of blood spurting intermittently.	0.6335368
