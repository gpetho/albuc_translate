There are many types of abscesses, as mentioned later in this book, and they differ in perforation and cutting; and there are two types, one in its own form, and one due to the place where it is on the body. For the abscess of the head is different from that of the anus, and the abscess of a fleshy area is different from one that occurs in joints, and each has its own judgment in the procedure.	One is the kind of tumour it is in itself and the humidities it contains. The other is the part of the body where it occurs. For the tumour occurring in the head is different from the tumour occurring on the posterior, and a tumour occurring in a fleshy part differs from one on the joints; each having its separate category of operation. There are some tumours that should not be opened till after the pus in them is matured and ripe.	0.7550349
