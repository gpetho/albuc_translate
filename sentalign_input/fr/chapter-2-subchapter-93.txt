Pain that comes from flatulence
This disease is called "vakirir" in our land, and it is a pain that comes in some members,
and then moves from member to member; and I saw what I tell you.
I was called to a sick woman, and she showed me her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and a little later, I saw it rise like a worm to the shoulder,
faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from one place to another;
the pain left that place, and fixed itself in the shoulder,
and then a little later ran through the whole body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me it kept turning around her body, as I saw.
I marveled greatly at how it moved from member to member, for I had never seen this disease in this manner.
However, I had seen many who had seen pain move from place to place,
but I had never seen it as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought it was because the woman had a dry body, and exposed veins,
and because of that appeared this constrained windiness;
and it does not appear this way in those who are delicate, and have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you want to cure this disease, and the patient feels that pain, if it appears to you as we have said,
then tie it above and below quickly, and then cut above so that the constrained windiness in the place comes out;
and cauterize the place; and if you do not see it with your eyes,
then treat it with what expels windiness, such as fetid pills, and serapinum pills, and similar others.
