Of the bladder
When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then cauterize him on the outside above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the joint of a thumb; and make a cautery on the outside of the back, or two if you need to; and let the cautery be key-shaped according to the aforementioned form.
