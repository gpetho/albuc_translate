It should be incised around the nail, grasped with forceps or a hook, and extracted from its root. Then treat it. If you wish, cauterize it as described previously in its chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, compact, round protuberance on the surface of the body.

Now the treatment is to draw out the wart and cut if off; or tie it off with a silken thread or a hair until it falls out; or if you wish, cauterize as said before, either with the actual cautery or with caustic.

It occurs all over the body, but mostly on the hands. Its treatment is to take a tube made of a goose feather or a strong eagle feather and place that tube over the callus so that the circumference of the tube surrounds it on all sides. Then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the callus.	It is found all over the body but mostly on the hands. The treatment is to take the quill of a strong feather of the goose or the vulture, and place the quill over the pimple so as to encircle it with the circumference of the tube; then revolve the quill with your hand so as to cut all round the pimple, and go deep into the flesh, and then the pimple may be drawn out by the roots.	0.90648806
Insert it deep into the flesh and extract the callus from its root. If you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:.	If you wish you may extract it with a tube of bronze or of iron, of this form.	0.6108833
The top of the tube should be thin, solid, and twisted to make it easy for the fingers to grasp and twist. If you wish, you may cauterize the callus as described previously for cauterizing warts, in the chapter on cautery.	The upper closed part of the tube should be fine, solid, and twisted, to give easy purchase for the fingers in holding and revolving it. If you wish you may cauterize the pimple as described earlier on the cauterization of warts in the book on the cautery.	0.8863092
