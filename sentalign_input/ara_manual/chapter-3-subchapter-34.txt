Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of dislocation of the toes.
You should straighten what has dislocated from it by gentle extension without force, and that is not difficult, rather it is easy. If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the dorsum of the foot, then the patient should place his foot on a level place on the ground.
Or on a board while he is standing like one walking, then you stand and place your foot on whatever protrudes from those joints, then press it down with your foot forcefully until it returns and you see that it is straightened and no protrusion appears in the place.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that takes the entire foot, which has two ends, then tighten it firmly and securely for three days, then loosen it and protect it from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are safe from recurrence, God willing.
