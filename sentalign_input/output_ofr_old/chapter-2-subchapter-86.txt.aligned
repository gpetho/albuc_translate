of a fistula wherever it may be Know that any wound or abscess, when it festers, is universally called a "fistula," and especially when it becomes hollow and forms a cavity.	You should know that any wound or tumour, when it becomes old and chronic, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal over, but discharges pus chronically and constantly, is generally called a fistula, in whatever part of the body it may be; but we call it a defluxion.	0.7488038
Now I must inform you about the treatment of a fistula that is made by manual work.	Now here I must explain to you the operative treatment of fistula and defluxion.	0.7192775
Know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that come to the large veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves, or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to any joint of the hands or feet; and there are some that occur within the principal member itself, and in similar places.	You should know that a fistula may happen in any part of the body; and some fistulae reach as far as some great vein or artery or nerve or membrane or intestine or the urinary bladder, or one of the ribs or dorsal vertebrae, or some highly complex joint such as the hand or foot, while some terminate quite near some major organ, and so on.	0.88017595
If a vein or nerve does not hinder you in the principal members, as we have said; and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, scrape it until all the corruption is removed, then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed; and if it is not healed, and releases fluid as before, know that you have not gone deep enough: so uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the area; and if it is thus healed, that is good.	If a bone be the cause of the fistula, and you are sure of that, then examine the fistula and open it up in the way I have told you, if there be nothing in the way like a blood-vessel or nerve or important organ, as we said. And if the bone is laid bare to you and there be in it some corruption and blackening, then scrape it until all the corruption be removed; then put on dressings that will encourage granulation, until it be healed. If it does not heal but discharges pus in the way it did before, then you may know that you have not yet managed to extirpate the corruption completely. Therefore you must expose it again and with the utmost diligence carry out the scraping and cleaning of it.	0.87482953
If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; so there is no other solution than to leave it to nature; and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it with forceps, extract it with a suitable instrument, and if there are many bones, pull them all out, do not leave a single one; and if the moisture hinders you, and there is no error or fear, cut both the moisture and the flesh, and free the bones. And if you cannot remove them at once, put something on the wound that generates decay, and leave it until the area around the bones is decayed, and then the bones will be easier to remove; and if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, just scrape the corruption until all the blackness is removed, then restore the wound; and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone, it must be scraped and cut all the way to the corruption, and then treated until it is joined; and I will tell you about a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take example and help in your work.	Then dress it; and if it heals, good; if not, then you may know that this corruption is very deep-seated in the body and out of reach, and there is nothing you can do for it but leave it to nature. If the diseased bone be a small one, and it be possible for you to extract it, then do so with a pair of fine forceps suited to the purpose. And if there be a number of bones then you must accurately carry out the extraction of all of them, and spare no effort to ensure that none is left. If any ligaments lie in your way and there be no danger in incising them, then make an incision into the ligaments and whatever tissues are there, and free the bones.	0.85886294
I placed a tent in one of these openings, and then examined all the openings, and found that they all connected with each other from all parts of the leg.	So I introduced a probe into one of the openings and the probe touched bone. Then I investigated all the openings and found them all communicating with one another in all parts of the leg.	0.8110399
For because of the bloodletting he often sobbed, but he was completely healed, and hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and it was of good quality and had no harm or adverse effects at all, neither coming nor going.	But he was completely cured, and in place of the bone there grew up firm tissue; his bodily state was sound and his strength was restored. He went about his business, and no hurt whatsoever came to him from walking.	0.6540332
