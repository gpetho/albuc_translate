On abscesses that occur from twisting of the nerves.	On the tumour arising from the twisting of a tendon.	0.7487601
Just as abscesses occur in arteries and veins, so too they occur in nerves: caused by a blow, or from excessive labor, or similar reasons; and most commonly they appear in the armpits, or the heel, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious abscess.	As a tumour arises on an artery or a vein, so may it also come in a tendon when it has been bruised; or it may arise from excessive fatigue, or such causes. This occurs mostly at the wrists, at the heel, and at all sites of articular movement.	0.8373039
Its color resembles that of the surrounding body, and it usually lacks pain; and when pressed hard, the patient feels a numbness similar to stupor.

And it is not a deep-seated abscess within the body; rather, it is beneath the skin, moves in all directions, and does not extend forward or backward.

And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, scrape it off, then remove it, bring the wound together with sutures, and care for it until it heals.	But if it be large, catch it up with a hook and dissect it away and remove it; and sew up the incision and dress until healed.	0.78941405
