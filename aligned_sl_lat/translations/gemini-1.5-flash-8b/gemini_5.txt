Having completed for you, O children, this book, which is the final work of knowledge in medicine with its completion, and having reached its end through its expositions and its own declarations, it seemed good to me to complete it for you with this Treatise, which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery, with the hand.
Since the operation with the hand has been neglected in our region and in our time, and has been entirely private: until perhaps its knowledge has perished, and its trace has been cut off: and nothing remained of it except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which other hands have altered: and error and hesitation befell them, until its intentions were closed, and its power was distanced: It has seemed good to me to revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise in it according to the way of exposition, and declaration, and abbreviation: and that I might come with the forms of the instruments of the cautery, and of the other instruments of the work: with the addition of the declaration, and the hastening of what is necessary.
However, the reason why a good craftsman of it with his hand is not found in this time of ours, is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be exercised beforehand in the knowledge of anatomy, as Galen has recounted, until he knows the aids of the members, and their shapes, and their junctions, and separations, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their exits, and the pulsating and still veins, and the places of their exits.
And because of that, Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with a work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We however have already said about that at the beginning of this book.
Because whoever is not knowledgeable of what we have said concerning anatomy is not prevented from falling into error, whereby men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science, and boast of it without knowledge, and without experience.
That is because I saw a foolish physician incise a scrofulous abscess on the neck of a woman, and cut some arteries in the neck; wherefore the woman's blood flowed, until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who dared to extract a stone from a man who was advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Therefore, he reached it and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Therefore the man died on the third day.
And indeed I had already been called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone, and the disposition of the sick man, that he would die.
And I saw another physician who was receiving payment from a certain Duke of our land for medicine, and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician, with his ignorance, hurried and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound an outlet.
Then he treated him according to his own desires.
Afterwards he sent him away after a few days, and commanded him not to loosen the bandage, and it remained so until his leg and foot were full of pus, and reached ruin.
Therefore I was called to him, and I hastened to loosen the bandage, and there followed tranquility, and he escaped from his pains.
However, the corruption had already become established in the limb, and I could not restrain it.
So the corruption ceased to spread in the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who pierced the cancerous abscess, and it ulcerated after days, until its malice was magnified with its owner.
This is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it should not be reached with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate its being completely severed.
And therefore, children, it is necessary for you to know that surgery is divided into two divisions: namely, surgery to which health is associated, and surgery with which there is danger in many dispositions. And I have already roused in every place of this book, in which surgery comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that, and to diminish it, so that fools do not find a way to speak ill of and disgrace it.
Therefore, take care of your measures with diligence and protection, and your sick with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading through the grace of God to health and praiseworthy success. Leave the terrible diseases of difficult cure; and remove your minds from what makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter into your faith and your benefit. For it is more remaining for your glory, and higher in this world, and finally for your possessions.
For Galen already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad physician.

Part I.
Concerning the benefit and harm of the cautery; and for which temperaments it is suitable, and at what time; and if with iron, or gold.
Chapter 1.
But before I recount the operations with it, it is necessary that I describe the qualities of its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is to be applied.
I say, therefore, that discourse on the quality of the cautery's benefit and harm is a lengthy and subtle discourse, a science, and a hidden secret.
Many wise men have spoken on it, and disagreed; and to me a little from their words is sufficient, fearing prolixity.
Therefore, I say that cautery benefits universally every temperament, with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments, which are a hot temperament without matter, and a dry temperament without matter.
However, in a hot and dry temperament with matter they disagreed.
For some said that cautery is beneficial in it.
And others said the opposite, namely that cautery is not suitable in a sickness which is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat, and it is unsuitable that it be healed from a hot and dry sickness with heat and dryness.
And he who says the opposite stated that through cautery benefit is given in every hot and dry sickness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare the human body and its humors to the temperament of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I myself say through his speech: that by experience it has now revealed it to me on several occasions.
However, it should not be applied unless someone already proven and practiced in the final exercise of the cautery chapter, and who has known the diversity of human temperaments, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their occurrences, and their duration.
However, there is no fear from the remaining temperaments, and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For all physicians have agreed upon them, and have not disagreed in their benefit with cautery in them.
And know, children, that from the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the limb that is cauterized: and does not harm another limb joined to it, except with slight harm.
However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the limbs, and perhaps causes a difficult-to-heal illness in the limb, and perhaps kills it.
But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows.
However, that has become known to us through experience, on account of the length of our service and study with the art, and our standing upon the truth of things; and because of that I am excused from the length of discourse.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time in which the cautery should be applied, and they put the time of spring as better.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the harm that is accidental due to the time is submerged in the benefit that is attracted with the cautery.
And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate slowness; because it is feared from them that a greater evil may occur than the small harm that comes in due to time.
And do not let it fall into your minds, O children, that which only the common people and foolish physicians do not fear, namely that the illness which is cured by cautery does not always have a return; and they place that as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think; because cautery is not, except in place of medicine, which alters the temperament, and dries the humidities which are the causes why pains occur.
However, cautery is superior to medicine in the speed of its cure, and the power of its action, and the strength of its dominion; and it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the temperament of the sick person, and the location of their illness, and its power; and what is prepared in their body from the collection of superfluities in it; and what reaches them in their acquisition from foods, and similar causes to these, unless it is the illness in which cautery is administered. A subtle illness in a limb, of few superfluities and humidities, like the cautery of a tooth, because of pain, and similar to it, for it is possible that that pain will not return to it.
But that happens in few cases.
But truly the common people's statement, that cautery is the last resort in medicine, is a correct statement; not in the sense they intend, however, because they believe that there is no cure comparable to medicine, nor to anything else after cautery has been applied.
However, the matter is the opposite of that, and the intention that cautery is the last resort in medicine is not, unless when we apply methods of cure for some illnesses, and those medicines are not effective; then, at the end of the matter, we apply cautery, and it is effective; then, it follows that cautery is the last resort in medicine, not in the way the common people and many unskilled physicians understand.
However, the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this unless due to the equality of gold and the excellence of its substance; and they said that the cautery's location does not cause pus. But that is not absolutely so; for I have already tested it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
However, when you cauterize with gold in fire, you are not shown when it is heated to the degree you want, because of the redness of the gold; and when it quickly reaches coolness, and if you add further heat to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Therefore, the artisan falls from that into practice: and because of that, cautery with iron is quicker and closer to us in its suitability for the operation.
And indeed I have already arranged this chapter on cautery according to chapters; and I have arranged them from head to foot, so that they will relieve the one seeking what they want from it. Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in the coronal suture.
Chapter Two.
Cautery here contributes to controlling moisture and coldness upon the brain; these two are the causes of headaches and copious discharge of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of sleepiness, and toothache, and sore throat; and generally of every illness that occurs due to coldness, such as paralysis, headaches, epilepsies, and apoplexies, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is, that you order the sick person first to be purged with a cleansing liquid medicine for three, or four nights, according to the sick person's strength, age, and custom.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor.
Then make him sit between your hands square, so that he has already placed his hands upon his chest.
Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever, therefore, your middle finger shall arrive, mark that place with the cautery. Then light the olive-shaped cautery: of which this is the form. Then place it upon the place marked with the cautery, descending, by which your hand may be gradually constrained, and you will turn it.
Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place.
If you see now uncovered a quantity of head-alkiel, or a quantity of zeuherbi, then raise your hand.
And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another from it if it cools: until the bones, which I told you, are seen.
Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak in it a poultice, and place it on the place: and leave it three days.
Then place on it the poultice soaked in butter, and leave it on the place, until the eschar of the fire is destroyed. Then treat it with the tetrapharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
Now they say that the more a wound remains open, the more it discharges pus: therefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized right down to the bone: and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of the bone is burned.
Then, after that which has been burned off the bone is scraped away, then it is treated.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the ultimate with the cautery, until it presses an imprint on the bone, so that the bone falls away, which is done in the manner of a kirate mold: or an instrument that women use for small alphabet infusions; and they believe that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and that the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it consolidates.
However, these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be appropriate except in some individuals, according to the path of caution.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with the patient's health.
For the head weakens from the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have observed in other limbs; and especially when the head of the weak person is naturally frail.  And indeed, the first type of cautery is more safe and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore operate with it in the interest of health.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Chapter 3.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head, and it is prolonged in the sufferer, and he uses fomentations, and poultices, and head-cleansers, and oils, and embrocations.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and none of those things help it, then consider.
For if the head of the sufferer is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and experiences violent cold, then cauterize with another cautery beneath the first slightly.
Then cauterize it [the area] above every horn of his head with a cautery, do not however penetrate the skin, and do not expose an amount of bone, as we have described.
And cauterize it [the area] with one cautery on the back of his head, in the place called the *vas*, which is the location where the cupping glass is placed: and elevate your cautery there, and do not expose the bone.
For the sufferer experiences intense pain because of it, different from the pain of the other cauteries on all of the head.
And I shall say this cautery is in its place: and it should be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head with a more delicate cautery, with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
And this is its form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a hemicrania, both with a burning medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is purged with cleansing medicines, and the remaining treatment is administered, as I have described in the divisions of illnesses, and that does not help completely: then cauterization is done in it according to two methods: either cauterization with a burning sharp medicine or with iron. The cautery with a burning sharp medicine is to take one clove of garlic, and to peel it, and to cut off its ends from two sides.
Then, incise the place of pain with a wide phlebotom (lancet), until a space is made beneath the skin, where the clove is inserted.
Then insert it into the space beneath the skin, until it is hidden; then, bind it over it with a suitable constriction bandage, and leave it for fifteen hours. Then, loosen it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days. Afterwards, place over it a poultice soaked in butter, until the place produces pus. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I have written in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
The cauterization of it with iron is, according to this method.
The cautery iron, whose shape is this.
And it is called *clauilis*, because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is something curved, and in its middle there is a small elevation.
Then place it on the area, and hold your hand; and you revolve the iron gradually with speed; and let the quantity that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, like half of it.
And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak lint in salt water, and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; then place lint with butter; afterward, treat with ointment until it heals. And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife-edge.
And beware of incision of the artery in this hemicrania, not properly ancient.
On the method of cauterizing in an ancient hemicrania.
Chapter V.
When treating hemicrania, with what we have said in the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and if the treatment does not help; and you see from the illness that what we have said about the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is insufficient, then it is necessary to heat the cautery knife until it becomes white after marking the place of pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or approximately that; and place your hand, in turn, and press it until you cut the artery, and reach the bone. However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves during chewing, so that the side or the nerve that moves it is not burned, from which spasm may result.
And be on guard, and cautious of the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut.
For in its cutting lies the fear, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not studious nor experienced; and he abandons the operation with that in the first place.
And I will come with a reminder of the regimen of blood flow arising from the artery according to its manner and in its place in this book.
If, however, you see from the illness that this cautery is insufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we spoke of in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with the cautery having two blades.
For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial. Concerning the manner of cauterization in earache.
Chapter VI. When earache occurs from cold, and is treated with remedies, and with the other treatment that we have discussed in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and that is what is called the Point, whose form is this.
Then, after its ignition, apply the points in a circular motion around the entire ear, as it revolves; or in a circular motion around each, if the pain is in both at the same time.
And move the cautery slightly away from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with ink; and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points in each ear, and so forth.
Then treat the places until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Torture.
Chapter VII.
Torture that is treated with cauterization is only from the types that arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases. And avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of torture with leeches, and head-cleansings, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the afflicted person with three cauteries: one near the root of the ear, and a second slightly lower from its temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part.
Because softening does not happen, unless in the part that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize it with a cautery directly at the upper extremity of the ear, slightly below the horn of the head, and another at the temple, whose length should be equal to the length of a thumb.
And hold your hand with the cautery until an amount equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type from the surgical knife, whose form has been previously described; however, it is not slightly thinner than that a little, as you see; and it is necessary that there be a little excess thickness in the knife. Then treat the places with what preceded, until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in ancient apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When apoplexy is longstanding, and you have treated it with what we said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what preceded: and the method of the cautery should be as previously described.
Also, cauterization is performed with a cautery on the stomach's opening, and it is the most extreme.
Then, treat him with what preceded.
Concerning the method of cauterization in forgetfulness.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that large hyerae and pills that cleanse the brain be given first to the sick person in a drink.
Then shave the sick person's entire head, and place a plaster of sinapis, as described in the treatise on plasters, upon his occiput; and apply it several times. For this is the method of the cautery; and do it according to the same order as I have said there. If therefore he is cured by it, it is good.
If not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye; and place the thickness of a finger between each cautery.
Then treat the cautery, with what preceded it.
If however you wish an addition, and the sick person is able to tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle.
If you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form that was given before.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed in cleansing the head with hyeeris, and with what we have said.
Then shave the head of the sick person; afterward cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on each horn of the head, and with a cautery on its back, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck.
If, however, in the illness, the body requires softening with more than those, and the sick person is patient, and the illness is strong, then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and the last one with a cautery until most of his skin is burned, and lift your hand.
Then treat him until he is healed: and thus the cautery of Oliuare.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that one whose epilepsy is from phlegm. Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the rest of the treatment which we have described in the division: when the sick person is strong, or is tolerant in receiving medicines.
However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing mastications for the brain are administered, for many days beforehand, with the improvement of foods.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner, and with another cautery on his occiput, and with a cautery on every horn of his head.
If, however, the sick person is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I described in the paralytic, and the softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped, according to the manner that preceded. If however the sick person is a child, then apply a subtle cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Melancholy.
Chapter XII.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that we have spoken of in the paralytic.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of the downward flow to the melancholy, and the body of the sick person is moist, then give him a drink that will purify his brain, according to what has preceded in the division; then shave the head of the sick person, and then make a neatly fashioned little roll of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head; and the sick person, seated and held square on all sides.
Then apply the liniment. And it is better made from the old butter of sheep.
And heat it over a fire with a moderate amount of heat, which the finger can tolerate when introduced into it.
Then evacuate it in the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this to the sick person once every week, with his other regimen being good, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small points on it, apart from which you should hold the hand with the cauterium: indeed, it should be smelling.
For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Then place on it a cloth soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in descending water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When you are shown the beginning of water in the eye, through the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and pour on the weak one, with what will cleanse his head.
And keep him from all moisture, and have him sit in a bath, fasting for a few days.
Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him above the two temples with two cauteries, if it is the beginning of the descent of water in both eyes simultaneously; or on one side, if it is the beginning of water in one eye: and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin; and let the cauteries be long in width of the temples; and beware of the flow of blood.
If you see anything from it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the knowledge, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting of them, and caution against the flow of blood.
And sometimes he is cauterized on the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries finally applied.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ancient lachrymal cases.
Chapter XIV.
When the tears of the eyes are old, persistent, and are above the veins and arteries that are on the exposed exterior of the head, it is verified that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery that I have described at the beginning of descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck under the two bones.
And if it needs further application, then cauterize it on every side of the eye cautiously, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a foul odor of the nose.
Chapter XV.
When you treat it, as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then hurry, and give the weak person decoctions in a drink for three nights; afterward, shave his head and cauterize it with a middling cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery.
Then cauterize it with a claw-shaped cautery, two cauteries, above the two eyebrows beneath the hairs slightly.
And guard against the artery, lest you strike it.
And this is the shape of the claw-shaped cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterization in softening the eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on every side; and let them be separated by two intervals; and let the length of each cautery be according to the lengths of the eyebrow; and do not bring your hand with the cautery to its utmost limit, but in accordance with the quantity of the third eyelid which is to be burned.
And this is the form of cautery according to this method of lunar cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are reversed, piercing the eye. Chapter XVII.
The cautery is in it according to two methods: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with a burning medicine.
In cautery with fire, beforehand command the sick person, if he is of those who cleanse them, to let his hairs fall away until they are lengthened and made equal. If, however, they prick him at their origin, then constrict his eyes with a bandage so that they are not moved until they are born.
When, therefore, they are born and made equal, then place the sick person's head in your bosom; then mark above the eyelids of his eyes with ink a mark that is in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place a cloth soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over the eye.
Then apply the cautery, whose form is this.
Then cauterize over the figure you have marked, gradually in many stages, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is completely burned.
And a sign of the success of your work is: if you see the eyelid already contracting, and the hairs rising at the puncture of the eye.
Therefore, raise your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Then place upon it a poultice with butter, until the eschar is removed.
Then treat it with ointment, until it heals.
If any hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid softens: then again cauterize that spot, as you did at first.
If however the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it, until it is raised to its natural place, and made even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
Concerning the method of cauterization with a burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter XVIII.
You should instruct the sick person to let the hairs fall out until they are lengthened and even.
Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from paper on cloth.
Then take from known soap and from unsoaked lime, each one ounce or nearly that in weight; then rub them together thoroughly, and make it quickly so that it does not cool down.
Then spread some of it from the paste onto the paper that you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one or two eyes.
And place under the eye a poultice soaked in egg white; and let the sick person's head be in your bosom.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it for a short time.
And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the medicine's biting, because its biting is found to be like fire.
So long as he finds it biting, then leave the medicine and move it with your finger.
When the biting ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised with burning or incision, it is well; and if not, then apply more medicine to the place where the medicine does not take effect, and does not darken, until your procedure is equal and the eye contracts.
Then place upon it wool with butter, until the skin of the burning is eradicated.
Then treat it with diaphanicon ointment, or another, until it heals.
And it is necessary for you in the operation to guard the last guard, so that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after days, and something from the hair fights in the eye, then apply medicine again to that place which softens from the eyelid itself, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it heals.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size and smallness.
Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be; and the path of righteousness is not hidden from him who studies this art.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a tear duct fistula.
Chapter XIX.
When you treat a fistula, if what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then you should cauterize it according to this method.
Tell the sick person to place their head in your lap, and let the attendant hold their head in their hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with their head.
Then place a poultice steeped in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over their eye; then apply the cautery iron, whose shape is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to be so held upward.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, over it.
And hold your hand with the cautery for a little while near the cautery, from the eye to the nose, so that your hand does not wander or the sick person is not disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If therefore you reach the beginning of your cautery up to the opening, it will be well.
And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it, and leave it for three days.
Then place a cloth with butter, and care for it with a drying ointment until it is healed. If forty days pass and it is not healed, then place a sharp, corrosive medicine upon it until the opening is uncovered; and shave it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing fistulas, which some of the ancients said.
Aim at the location of the fistula, and split it open; then place a thin camahan, that is, a thin cannula, of this form, into the fissure.
And pour into it a drachma of melted lead, and hold your hand with a good retention cannula, and let the sick person not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place on the eye of the sick person a poultice soaked in egg white, or in water.
For lead burns the fistula location, and heals it with a marvelous cure.
If the fistula is healed by what we have said about cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nostril, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will return to its own proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in lip fissures.
Chapter XX.
Often fissures occur in the lip, which are called "pili," especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, with what we have said concerning the division of illnesses, and if the treatment does not help, then use a small knife cautery, according to this form.
And its concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then treat it with a cautery, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a fistula of the mouth.
Chapter XXI.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth; then it produces pus, and bursts; afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula is formed; then you treat it, and treatment does not benefit it, then it is necessary that you cauterize the cautery according to the size that it takes in the fistula.
Then insert it, ignited, into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and its extremity: do it once or twice.
Then treat it afterward, with what we said about treatment until it is cured.
If, therefore, the pus is discharged and it is healed, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to expose the area, and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come in its head.
Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
Chapter XXII.
When the gum softens because of moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help, then place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Then with fire, a cautery, whose form will come after this, so that you place the Cannula on the tooth: and quickly introduce the heated Cautery into it: and hold your hand for a short time, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire already having reached the root of the tooth.
And lift your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to what you wish.
Then let the sick person fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour; and let them spit it out.
For the moved tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
Chapter XXIII.
When toothache is due to cold, either there is cold or a worm in the tooth itself, and treatment with medicines is of no avail, then a cautery is applied in two ways: either a cautery with butter, or a cautery with fire.
However, the cautery with butter is to take fresh butter and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a pot.
Then take a cotton swab and wrap it around the tip of the probe.
Then immerse it in the boiled butter; and quickly place it on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools; then repeat it several times, until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth; and place heated iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
However, its cauterization with fire is to apply a brass cannula or iron cannula. And let there be something of its thickness in his body so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's bone.
Then take the cautery, whose form will come, and place it upon that tooth; and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Do it several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day or on another day.
And it is necessary, in the impression of that cautery, that the sick person fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for one hour; then he shall spit it out.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever extremity of force is possible; and this is the form of the cannula.
Of the method of cauterizing in Strophules.
Chapter XXIV.
When Strophules are from phlegm and from cold humours, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and force their digestion quickly: then apply a concave cautery to them, whose form is this.
Having two open extremities, so that smoke may escape from the cautery at the other extremity; and place it heated over the abscess once, and secondly, if it needs it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place over it a poultice steeped in butter, until that which the fire has burned away is removed.
Then treat it with tooth ointment, until the form of the cannula heals.
Concerning the method of cauterization for hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
Chapter XXV.
When humors overcome the bronchial passage, and especially when it is with a cold temperament, then it is necessary that the infirm be first evacuated with dissolving medicines.
Then cauterize it at the nocrati at the root of the throat in a depressed place: and beware, lest you reach the throat with the cauterium, nor the skin, unless something of it.
Then cauterize it with another cauterium at the junction of the neck at the last vertebra of it,  and let the cauterium be a narrow one, according to the manner which preceded.
Then treat it with what preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in diseases of the lungs and cough.
Chapter XXVI.
When cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the sick person has no fever, nor consumption, and the illness is long-standing, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the collarbone in depressed, gentle, empty places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be of a cannula, according to the shape that preceded.
And if your cauterization wishes to be by puncturing with a cautery, which is called Punct, whose form preceded in the puncturing of the pain of the ears: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures up to almost another.
Then treat him with that which preceded, until he is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Therefore, the cauterization will be alleviated when you perform it with three cauteries at one time.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the Titillico, in the dislocation of the Humerus.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the assisting cause of moisture is dislocated, and it does not settle in its hour of return from its dislocation, until it is accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified to it, then you must reduce the dislocation in the first place.
Then the sick person is to be placed on their back, or on their healthy side.
Then lift the skin, which is in the interior Titillico towards the upper part with the fingers of your left hand; and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then take a cautery with two prongs. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, so that the figure of the cauterization then is of six cauteries: and there are prongs according to the fineness of the thread.
And this is the form of a cautery with three prongs.
And sometimes one is added on top of this way, so there are eight cauteries.
Then place crushed leeks with salt over the cautery.
Then make the infirm adhere to stillness, so that the limb does not move at any time, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is upwards, and that rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a claviform cautery, or with multiple puncturing cauteries.
For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the infirm is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When there are cold and many humidities in the stomach, until they draw it from its complexion, and phlegms multiply upon it, and constant methods of treatment do not benefit: then it is necessary that the sick person lie on their back, and extend their legs and hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery beneath the spoonful of the chest the size of one finger with a spoon cautery, and two cauteries below from the two sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
And lengthen between each so that they do not join, when they will cause pus. And let the depth of the cautery be the quantity of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this shape without addition; and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape, and let the cautery by which this is done be one according to the shape of a circle according to this shape.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it with that which is terrified by this cautery, and it is, that you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity which you wish with encaustic, then cauterize it with the point cautery, then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the manner of cauterizing a cold liver.
Chapter XXIX.
When pain in the liver occurs from cold and moisture, or from thick wind, until it emerges from its natural complexion by the expulsion of superfluities, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the sick person be placed on their neck, and mark with encaustic three cauteries according to this figure, and this same quantity on the lower liver below the hypochondria, where the human elbow reaches: and let the space that is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of the body, straight: and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
And let the quantity of what is burned be, in thickness of the skin, the quantity of half of it, not added; and let the sick person be standing on their feet.
If however he is not standing, then let him be lying down, having now extended his legs and raised his arms. This is the form of the cautery.
And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And guard yourself, lest you proceed too far in the cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, wherefore the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: for the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
Concerning the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Chapter 30.
When an issue occurs, and you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, it afflicts the sick person with pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, with the pain there is a vehement sharpness; and you see already, that its treatment has wearied its physicians.
Therefore, it is necessary that the sick person lie on their neck.
Then mark the location of the abscess with ink; then apply the cautery, which is likened to a ray.
And this is its form.
And cauterize with it one cautery, until the entire skin is burned and reaches the pus, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for issues, until it is healed.
And it is not appropriate for one to use this kind of cautery unless their study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have come together with experience several times; then, indeed, let them dare to undertake such an operation.
But truly, to leave it be, is better in my view.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Pleursy.
Chapter XXXI.
The ancients said that cautery with the roots of aristolochia for cold pleurisy in this manner.
And it is that you take from the dry long roots of aristolochia, one longer root found among them, and let it be about the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil, and light it in fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery at the point where the fork joins the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly sloping downward towards the part under the chin.
And with two cauteries also on that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backward; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And with three cauteries from behind: one on that which is between the two shoulder blades, and two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades.
And you should not press your hand with the cautery, but rather it should be on the manifest skin by smelling. And some ancients have said that there are people who use a cautery of iron similar to a rod; and they cauterize, and they introduce it into that which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess itself, and pus comes out; as we said regarding the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with the cautery there is a fear that either the weak man dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Spleen, Chapter XXXII.
When you treat an illness of the spleen, with what we have said concerning treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then the cautery is on it in three ways, which are all right.
One of which is that you make three cauteries, or four, in a line along the length of the spleen, according to the shape of the liver cauteries, whose shape preceded.
And let there be between each cautery the amount of a finger's breadth, or a little more or less.
And let the method of the cautery be, as we said in the cautery of the liver, equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the sick man lie supine on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you heat a cautery having two prongs, which we spoke of in the chapter on the dislocation of the shoulder; and lift the skin, which is directly over the spleen, where the sick man's left elbow reaches; and let your lifting of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall lengthwise along the body.
Then insert the two intensely heated prongs, until with them you penetrate the skin on the other side; then withdraw the cautery; thus, four cauteries are made. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then treat the cautery after you let it emit pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than any of the previous treatments.
Concerning the method of cauterization in dropsy.
Chapter XXXIII.
The cautery does not fall upon dropsy, unless properly applied.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment that we have described in the divisions, and the treatment does not benefit, then you should cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery on the stomach, and another on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two cauteries on the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be near the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it may emit pus for a long time.
And do not remove the sick person from treatment after the cautery with it; for it is necessary that two intentions be aggregated to him: and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, according to the form that preceded it; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to the form that preceded it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Feet and Legs. Chapter Thirty-Four.
When abscesses form in a hydrops patient, and they are filled with yellow water, it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot, at the juncture between the auricular and annular areas. Raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand, and do not repeat it at all.
For the yellow water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Then, make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like end of the cautery.  And let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other below that, approximately in the middle of the leg.  And on each thigh, make two cauteries.  And leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water sweats from it; then treat it with the rest of what we have said.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in abdominal distention. Chapter 35.
When the abdominal distention is from cold and dampness, weakening the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines; and treatment is applied, but it does not heal; and you see the sick person tolerating a cautery of strong potency, then cauterize the person with a large cautery on their stomach, in accordance with what preceded in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery, and with four small cauteries in the circumference of the navel, with a small nail-like cautery; and with a large cautery, or two cauteries, above the hypochondrium.
And if you see abundant moisture, and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize them with a cautery on the breastbone, and with a cautery on each hip; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For this is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors or corrupted moisture, and treatment is attempted with what we stated in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower spine of the back, slightly triangularly beneath the almeidati, and with a cautery under the navel by about two fingers' width.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food does not digest, and you see his face becoming ulcerated, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, as previously described: and with a cautery on his liver, and another on his spleen, using the clauili cautery; and leave the cautery open for a time; then treat him until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you excise althelul, then heat the cautery that resembles a ray.
Then introduce the heated cautery into the excised althelul; and with the last of your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein through which blood flows: do this once or twice. If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have described.
Then care for them with whatever helps them from among the ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more helpful in the end.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
When the sick person does not obey the incision and the operation which we have recounted in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is healed with a cautery.
Therefore, when a fistula occurs in someone, and becomes old, pus runs from it, and corrupted humours.
Therefore, it is fitting that you probe it with a fine probe.
Then ascertain its depth with a probe.
Then heat the cautery, which is like a ray.
Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula itself and the extent to which the cautery point penetrates. And repeat the cautery on it, until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your need.
And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if there is one there, or a major vein; or if the fistula goes to the bladder, or to the bowel, then guard yourself from these locations in all respects.
And do not do it unless the fistula is in a fleshy place, and you think it is not penetrating.
Then treat the place until it is healed.
If however the place is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time, then know that it is now completely healed.
And if materials are not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupt bone is deep within it, or something like that; whose mention will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Kidneys.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or from a severe wind, and it lessens on account of that which is ailing the patient, then it is necessary to cauterize it over the almethen over the kidneys themselves, with a cautery over each kidney with a clauile cautery, whose description preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time on the almeidatu itself.
Therefore three lines will come.
Therefore the last ones will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Chapter XL. When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, to the point that the weak person does not retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic bone begin, and cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the summit and another from the left: and let the length of this cauterization on either side be according to the size of a thumb's node; and cauterize it with a cautery on the lower back, or with two cauteries, if you need them: and let it be according to what the preceding cautery has been.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb. Chapter XLI.
When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and it is prevented from impregnation by this, and her menses are corrupted, and their expulsion is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in cauterizing the bladder, and with a cautery above the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be like the previous one.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Chapter XLII.
When mucous humors are discharged into the anus's pouch, and become the cause of its exit from its place; and the sign of this is that one leg is prolonged over the other, when they are compared to each other; and the place of the dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the affected area above the anus's pouch with a similar circular cautery; after you mark it with ink around the pouch, as it revolves; and so that the pouch itself falls into the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the same form as that used in the cauterization of the stomach.
If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery; and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica. Chapter XLIII.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and moisture; and the patient is treated with what we have described in the division, and the treatment does not help and it becomes chronic; then it is necessary to relieve the patient of the gross humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar remedies.
Then cauterize it.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either a cautery with burning medicines, or a cautery with fire.
Cautery with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is to cauterize over the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make in them a good or bad depth.
And let the space that is between each cautery be of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes however, the cautery is made in the middle over the head of the hip itself.
Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, one: so that the circle contains the entire hip.
And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain adheres to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
However, if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, over the place to which the afflicted person there points, where the pain is, and with your cautery on the calf four fingers toward the wild side for a short time: and let the cautery be a knife-like one. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
If the afflicted person indicates that the pain extends to near the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a point cautery, three, or four, or more, if it needs it.
And if he indicates pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-like cautery.
And beware in all your cauterizations, that you do not go too far with the cautery so as to burn the nerve, or a large artery, and thereby bring upon the afflicted person a bad injury, or contraction.
And indeed I have already seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in the cauterization, and the leg swelled, until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then came the loosening of the bowels, and death after that.
If the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this method.
And certain wise men said in the cauterization of the anus, of which cautery this is the method.
Make a cautery of iron, whose diameter be half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date stone, or a little less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
And let the space that is between each cautery be the quantity of a thumb's knot: and let the cauteries be open on both sides: and let their height be like a knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle of iron fitting well into the cauteries.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in fire until it glows red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed upon the anus of the sick person lying on their healthy side.
Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at one time.
Then leave him for three days.
Afterwards, plaster with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat him with ointment, until he is healed.
Albucasis says, "By this sort of cautery, my children, we have used little, on account of the terror of its appearance, and because we find few who will wait upon it.
However, it is a good cautery for him who suffers, and finds its place with him.
However, cautery with burning medicines is, that you make two samia having a perforated armlet, into which descends the hinge of its door of bronze or iron, the length of the wall: of which their height be two knots, or approximately equal.
And let the space between each be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let them hold each other together, according to this form.
Then place it on the box of the anca, the sick person lying on their healthy side.
And press your hand firmly on the box of the anca.
Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been heated with fire for a short time, and hold it for the length of an hour: and let the sick person endure its burning and its cauterization, for it finds burning like fire, until the burning subsides.
Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe the whole anca with sweet water, and then leave it for three days.
And place butter on it until the blackness of the cauterization is removed: and leave it for several days, and pus will run from it.
For this is the final aid.
Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a poultice on it, containing water, as you did on the anca, equally.
And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Take alkali and quicklime, both of one part: grind both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part is perforated with one small hole, according to the quantity that the ray itself enters: and place under the bottom of the pot another glazed pot: and pour over the alkali and lime from sweet water, so that both are submerged by a finger: after which you compress them with your hand with a good compression: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glazed pot.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over other lime: and strain it until it is renewed.
For it will then be very strong in sharpness, which is administered in many surgical operations, and in the cauterization of the other limbs.
Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
And there are medicines with which the anca is cauterized, also like tesisie, and honey of anacardium, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
And Galen, indeed, recounting, reported the cure of a certain man from the ancients, by which the pain of the anca and sciatic vein was cured: and he magnified it to be very great.
And he said that he did not need any other cure, and that he was healed in one instance, until he reported that perhaps he entered the bath carried, and emerged from it already healthy. And it is to be taken from green seitaragi; and if green is not found, let the dry, fresh one be taken; and let it be thoroughly rubbed with some fat, and placed upon the anca, where the pain is, or the leg, or in the thigh; and let it be bound, and let it be left for three hours, or for the amount of time that the sick person feels the sedation of the burning.
Then put him into a bath.
When therefore his body becomes moist, put him on a seat.
For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
And know that one should not use a cautery with these remedies unless after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides, who said that goat dung, when a sciatic vein is cauterized with it, helps it: and the cautery is done in this way.
Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep place which is between the toe and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Then take dry goat dung, and burn it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Then do it again.
Therefore do not cease doing it, until the sensation on the affected area reaches the heel, and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called the Vaccinum cautery.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Chapter XLIV.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back due to many causes, either from an accident, or a blow, or from the evacuation of excess fluid, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter.  And cautery is not applied except in this single case, which arises from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after the patient has been purged with foul pills, and similar things, let three lines be made on the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the area itself.  Then, after marking with ink five cauteries along each line, or more, according to the amount that the patient's tolerance allows, perform cauterization with a cautery needle.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a cautery with a middle point, in this manner.
On the method of cauterization in the beginnings of a hump.
Chapter XLV.
This illness often occurs in very young children.
And the sign of its beginning in children is: that there occurs a constriction in their breathing upon lifting, and movement; and you find at the last vertebra of the back and its joints, that it has already begun to project above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see it, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is a circle according to this form.
And let the cautery encompass the entire part of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize in a circle the vertebra with a pointed cautery, make two or three lines; and let the points be close together.
Then treat the place, until it is healed with what we have said.
And be careful not to apply the cautery to the hump that is formed in a spasm of the nerve.
Concerning the method of cauterization in gout and joint pains. Chapter XLVI.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors that flow to any member of the body, then when they occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call it gout properly.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery will remove them.
And it is, that one should cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
This is its form.
And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and this frequently happens, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries, from every side, with this same claw-shaped cautery. If, however, more of this cautery is needed, then cauterize it. And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we said about cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, then puncture around the foci, like two lines revolving.
If, however, pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, over each knot, and over the palm of the hand.
If the pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not remove the sick person from a good regimen, from the re-reception of medicines.
For if a good regimen is undertaken, and the phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Ruptures.
Chapter XLVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or viscus descends to the testicle, and it is initially close by: then it is necessary that you command the sick person to discontinue eating on that day.
And that he uses laxatives, so that the stool may descend from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and command him to hold his breath, until it emerges, or the viscus, or intestine, appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink beneath the rupture, above the pubic bone, with a sign whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then cauterize with a cautery, whose form is this, until it turns white and throws off sparks.
Then reduce the intestine, or viscus, to its concavity.
Then let the attendant place his hand over the spot so that the intestine does not escape: and you have already opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a pillow beneath him, and one servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark, your hand holding the cautery straight.
And hold it until you meet with it the mouth: or again with it a second time, if you have not met it with it to the mouth in the first.
And carefully watch for the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and that death, or great harm, come upon the sick person through it.
And know that when you do not meet with the cautery the mouth, your operation is not beneficial.
And the cautery for infants should be fine, according to their size.
Then treat with the remaining ointments until it heals.
And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you place nourishment for the duration of his treatment, to soothe his belly, so that his bowel does not expel at the effort of straining and evacuating.
Then, when he wishes to rise after forty days, then apply a properly made bandage, and let him keep it for another forty days.
For when he uses this regimen, he is thus healed with complete healing.
However, when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and one fears that they will increase, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be about one-third of it.
Then treat it with what we have said, and it will not increase.
And some of the earlier ones have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line to the lower side. And place your hand in the middle with the cautery iron.
But the first cautery is easier and better. Concerning the method of cauterization in pains due to a fall or blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When, in certain limbs, pain arises from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery iron.
And let the cauterization of each limb be according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain emanating from it.
If, therefore, it is healed by the first cauterization, it is well.
If not, then repeat the cauterization.
Because it is customary for these pains to shift from one limb to that which is near it.
Therefore, it is necessary to pursue them with cauterization until the infirmity is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Leprosy.
Chapter XLIX.
Lepers are sometimes greatly helped by cauterization.
And especially the type of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider this.
If the leprosy is unrelenting, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it neither descends nor stands still, and you fear that the corruption will spread to the patient's entire complexion, then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, marked, and a second below it towards the forehead near the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind above the nape of the neck.
And lastly, keep your hand with the cautery for a short time, until it imprints a small mark on the flesh, and the skin peels from it; so that the discharge of thick vapors is alleviated.  And cauterize also the spleen with the cautery, as previously instructed.
But if the leprosy has already spread over the patient, and appears clearly, then you should cauterize with the cauteries mentioned on the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the buttocks near the tailbone, and one on the buttocks itself, in the area where the fat deposits, and two on the hips; that is, one on each hip, and two on the knees, one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the soft parts of his chest.  And cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his fingers and feet, and cauterize on each heel of his feet, and on the sensitive parts of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are above the heel, so that you do not burn them. And sometimes a cautery is used on the sternum, and another on the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more it helps, and the more beneficial it is.
And know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numbed.
And there should be cauteries of various sizes, and small, according to the limbs and joints, according to what has been said before in the types of instruments.
Chapter L.
When any limb is numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize the numb limb with cauteries, according to the magnitude or smallness of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes a cauterization is performed for a numbness that occurs in the hand and foot, in the spinal column of the back at the exit points of the nerves that move that limb, and the numbness is removed.
But let no one presume upon it unless he is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit points of the nerves that move the body.
Concerning the method of cauterization according to Albaras.
Chapter LI.
When Albaras is longstanding and nothing from the resources of medicine is effective, then cauterize over it with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Then treat it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and arnoglossa leaves, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood: of each, one part; mix all these together and apply them to a cloth, and adhere it to the place until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Cancer.
Chapter LII.
When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it revolves.
However, the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
However, to me it does not seem so, because I fear that it will become ulcerated, and I have already seen that happen several times. And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries. Concerning the manner of cauterization in Adubelati.
Chapter LIII.
When someone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excess causing it, or because of the patient's age, when he is decrepit and has little blood, or because of the time, and the need to hasten the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it will hasten with maturation.
If however you wish a perforation of it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, of which this is the shape.
And place it in the middle of Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the patient, so that the course of the pus may be alleviated.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a corrosive evil. Chapter LIII.
Corrosion is nothing but a corruption that travels through the member and corrodes it, like fire consumes dry wood.
If therefore you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate a cautery with fire, then apply many cauteries of fire, small and large iron cauteries, according to what suits that place in which the corrosive is.
Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains at all. Then leave it for three days, and put pulverized sulfur with oil on the cauterized places, until all the eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on whatever remains of the corrupted places.
And it is sometimes cured with a sharp medicine.
For indeed it rises in place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker benefit: and I have already said that its cauterization with a sharp medicine is in division: therefore take it there when you need it.
Of the method of cauterizing in Corns, and Warts. Chapter LV.
Often this ailment occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered thing that injures the foot. And cautery in them is indeed in two ways: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for cautery with fire, the cautery should be a concave one, like a bird of prey's wing, made of iron, according to the size of the corn on all sides, and have thin edges.
Then place it, heated, over the corn. Then revolve the hand with the cautery in a circle around the corn, until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn, and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus. Then plaster it with wild figs, crushed with salt, and leave the plaster over it at night. For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the area with a generative flesh ointment until healed.
If they are not converted, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then apply a cautery to them with hot water. And it is as if you take a cannula of brass, or iron, or of a vulture's feather, and place it on the corn or whitlow.
Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, hold your hand, and rotate it with pressure of your hand for a short time, so that the edge of the cannula presses into the root of the corn, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the corn.  And let the sick person wait for a short time over the burning of the hot water for one hour.
Then leave it, for the corn will be eradicated with its roots.
Do this with each one, one by one, until you come to all that are of them on the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which produces flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Tremor.
Chapter LVI.
When tremor occurs in someone from cold in the nerve, or from a quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four cauteries, or five, on the spinal vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on his chest with a cautery, and on his stomach with a cautery.
For tremor ceases with the cautery of olive oil, and the health of cold sickness hastens. Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter LVII.
Sometimes foul Albathir, that is, pustules, are expelled in the body, which are formed from corrupted gross matter.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary first to cauterize every head of the pustule with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, whose end is ignited with fire.
Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Or with a lenticular cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way, and they are not increased; and the superfluity causing them is broken, and they are healed from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Chapter LVIII. Many times a flow of blood occurs from an artery that is cut in a wound, which happens externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a limb, and similar things; and it becomes difficult to cut it off.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery, and press it firmly until the blood is contained under your finger, and nothing more escapes from it. Then place small olive-shaped cauteries, and many large ones in number, in the fire, and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been ruptured, and place the cautery on the vein itself, after you have quickly removed your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
If it [the bleeding] escapes when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery and extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire. Therefore do not cease doing this, one after the other, until the blood is cut off.
And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and some other harm befall the sick person. And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off; especially when the artery is large, unless it is done in one of four ways.
Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off. Or it must be tied with a strong ligature.
Or medicines of a nature to cut off the blood may be placed upon it, and it should be bound with a suitable constricting bandage.
But whoever performs its excision with a ligature and constriction with a cloth, or by applying burning substances and similar things, does not greatly benefit it, except rarely.
If this should happen to someone, and a physician or medicine is not present, then let him begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and strongly constricting it until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound and over the artery.
And the finger should not be removed, but kept upon it with very cold water, continually, until the blood hardens and thickens, and is cut off. And meanwhile, let him consider what it needs, either from a cautery or from medicine.
End of the First Part.
Albucasis' Surgical Book, Part II. Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar matters.
We have already discussed in the First Chapter all illness in which it is fitting to use cautery with fire and burning medicine, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries. And I have placed there chapters from the head down to the foot.
And I shall proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that the seeker may have his question relieved. And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, children, to learn that in this chapter there is the same fear as in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of that, it is necessary that there be greater caution in it, since in the operation that is in this chapter, evacuation with blood often occurs, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or an incision over an abscess, or the opening of an exit, or the treatment of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or an incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which trembling, and fear, are associated, and death occurs in many of them.
And I warn you, lest that in which there is hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes the ways of men with the ways of illnesses fall upon you in this art.
For among them is he who is angry with his illness, and death is light to him; because of the severity of what he finds in his illness and the length of its malice.
And with illness is the fear that signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his tribute, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful. Therefore you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be more intense than your greed and your rapacity.
And do not presume upon anything from it unless after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which a praiseworthy succession has arrived.
And use in the treatment of all your sick persons, prognosis and indication of that to which health is fittingly directed.
For in that is your help regarding the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, children, with His understanding, and may He not remove from you guidance and inspiration, for it is in His hand.
And indeed I have arranged this chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization, from the neck up to the feet: so that your inquiry concerning it, and what you need, might be eased.
Concerning the treatment of Water that collects in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this ailment frequently happens to children at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
And sometimes it happens also from a hidden cause that is not known.
And I myself have not seen this illness in anyone other than children, and death has hastened to all whom I have seen afflicted by it.  Therefore, it seemed to me to omit treatment for it.
And I myself saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger each day, until it could not sit upon itself, owing to the size of its head; and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture, indeed, either gathers between the skin and bone, or gathers under the bone above the fissure.
And if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single fissure in the middle of the head, in width, and the length of the fissure should be like two knots, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of a lancet.
If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place those two fissures, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head open from every side, and water is pressed out when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and that is not hidden from you, then it is necessary to make three fissures in the middle of the head, according to this method.
And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Then apply a poultice of wine and oil to it until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with splints and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound with equality.
And feed the weak person with all dry foods of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is, that you consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes there is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and the accumulation of water appear to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the sick person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Concerning the incision of Arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When cataracts occur to someone in the eyes or the chest, and it becomes old and medicine does not help the condition, then the final treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, it is necessary that the sick person shave his head.
Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries may appear.
Then the sick person should tighten his neck with any cloth he has.
Then consider where the vein beats.
And the places of both are the places that are depressed behind the ears; and it is rarely hidden, except in some people.
Then mark with ink on each: and cut each with a scalpel accurately on both sides, the incision reaching the bone; and let it be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, introduce the scalpel under the artery and cut it upwards with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers.
For when the vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating outflow, which leaps inward with a frequent leap.
If, however, the artery is not apparent to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth.
Then mark with ink and cut to the bone.
And that which ought to be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you emit from it more or less. All of that according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the sick person and the fullness of his artery.
Then consider the wound.
Then if anything remains on the bone from the sifac, then cut it away, so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man suffers from chronic hemicrania, or acute catarrh due to acrid humors and heat in the temples, or severe chronic headache, and similar conditions: and treatment is applied with the usual methods of medicine, and it does not help: then we find in these ailments the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described.
And the method of operation in extracting them is, that the infirm person shave the hair that are in the temples, and direct attention to the apparent artery in the temple.
For it indeed shows itself to you from its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few men, or by extreme cold.
If it is hidden from you, then the infirm person should tie his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Or apply vapors to the place with hot water, until it appears to you in a clear manifestation. Then take the spatula, which I have previously formed. Then scrape the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards until you pull it out of the skin, and cause it to escape from the layers beneath it on every side.
If however the artery is delicate: then wrap it with the tip of the hook.
Then cut a part from it according to the amount by which its ends will be elongated and contracted, and so that a flow of blood does not occur.
For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood will not ascend completely. Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to three.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk or strong cords, so that putrefaction does not quickly occur at the wound before healing, and a flow of blood does not happen.
Then cut away the excess that is between the two ligatures.
Do that at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery iron up to the bone, with a knife cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in place of the same work.
And it is better work, unless the sick person has a fever, or is of a hot complexion.
Because cautery is from among those things that help in ending moistures.
Therefore, it is a better remedy.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with old lint, and pads properly made be placed upon it.
And after the solution, it should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until healed.
If, meanwhile, while you are operating, a flow of blood occurs from an artery, then quickly proceed to cauterize it, or to fill the place with zegi, and bind your hand tightly until the blood is stopped.
If none of those are present for you, then place your finger on the area until the blood clots.
And apply the area with water of intense cold, until the sharpness subsides, and it is bound as is appropriate.
And because that which is lighter and easier for the extraction of the artery is to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades: and the sharpness of the two blades should be like an almond.
However, they are of much less sharpness than two blades.
Because if they are sharp, like two blades, the cold proceeds to both, and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly; with this, therefore, the work is better than all work, and lighter, and easier.
And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with ink; and place both heated strongly until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places, so that that which is between its extremities is stretched.
For they do not consolidate completely with this cautery.
And this is the form of cautery.
Concerning the treatment of persistent acute tear discharge from the eyes.
Chapter IV.
When there are persistent tears, and their flow is from veins on the outer skull: and no medical treatment with medicines helps them, and you see the patient's face already red, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, as if ants were crawling: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their hairs are already corroded with the corrosion: and his eyelids are inflamed from the intensity of the tears: then the ancients needed this operation in treating them, and they called this treatment, with the Knife.
And it is to instruct the patient to shave the hairs on his forehead.
Then make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead, along the length of the forehead: and the length of each incision should be about two fingers, and one incision should be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly offset from the movement of the temples, and the third on the opposite side: and be careful not to cut the arteries which are on the two sides: and keep your hand away from the junction of the two jawbones, and let the space of each incision be the size of three fingers joined together: and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dry cloths, with which to absorb the blood.
Then introduce a spatula with two sharp ends, whose following is the shape.
From the incision that is on the side of the temple, up to the second incision: and scrape away all the skin that is between the two incisions, as if it were over a bone. Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Then withdraw this spatula, and introduce into the first incision again another instrument, called a sharp knife, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side toward the flesh attached with the skin, and its smooth side toward the bone; and push it until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes; except that the incision continues up to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after an equal quantity of blood runs out, express the places from the pieces of coagulated blood. Then place in every fissure a linen cloth from old cotton, and place over them cushions soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar.
And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer a plentiful infusion with lukewarm water.
Then treat it with basilicon ointment, and the other remedies used for wounds, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of acute tears and cataracts in the eyes from internal causes of the head.
Chapter V.
When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs occur in someone, and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their appearance already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hair falls out from them, and there is a sharp, painful, and injurious headache, with consequent sneezing; then, from these occurrences, understand that these materials and catarrhs do not arise except from many veins.
And the better treatment for them is this.
And it is that you should order the sick person to shave their forehead.
Then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or a little to the side, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision extend to the bone; and withdraw your hand from the temporal muscles, which move during mastication, until when the bone is exposed; and you will dry the whole blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two edges of the incision with old cloth, or with linen strips.
Then bind it from above with compresses; and soak the compresses with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you remove it, and see that the hot abscess is now lessening, then it is necessary that you rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow, such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of rosin, and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear. Chapter VI. Anything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water, vinegar, and similar things; or some animal.
Therefore, when a stone, or a kind of stone from those that are not added nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun. If you then see the stone, then instill into the ear something of violet oil, or sesame oil.
Then administer its extraction, and cause sneezing with a condiment, and close the nostrils at the advent of the sneeze, after you have placed around the ear scraps of cloths or wool, and extend the ear upward.
For often it departs with this treatment.
If however it does not depart, then administer its extraction with tweezers, that is, with small pliers: the form of which is this.
If therefore it departs with the tweezers, it is good.
And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine, simple, few-fold hooked instrument. If therefore it does not depart through that, then make a tube of bronze, and introduce the end of the tube into the ear's hole very far, and fill that which is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no way for wind except through the tube: then extract with your wind by strong suction. For often it departs with that which we have narrated.
If however it does not depart in this way, then take from the helkalimbat, or from the viscus, that is, the prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it at the tip of a rod after you have wrapped a suitable piece of cloth around it: then introduce it into the ear's hole with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not depart with all that we have narrated, then hurry to cut, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of the incision is, that the phlebotomist first weaken the cephalic vein, and extract from it blood according to the measure of his strength.
Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear, near his fat in a depressed area there; and let the incision be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone: then remove it with what is possible to you of the instruments.
Then suture the incision quickly and care for it until it heals.
If the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains, which grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
If however it does not yield to you for extraction, then take a thin, subtle spatula, according to this shape.
And administer with it the removal of that sort of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think that the grain is already moistened by the ear's vapor, until you put it into many fragments; then extract them with hooks, or with a fine probe, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction is thus eased.
However, when water enters the ear, the sick person should use sneezing with a pillow first; and already he has filled his ear with some old cotton; and is lying on that ear, in which is the water.
If therefore it emerges through it, it is good.
And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them a little with fire, and let the sick person insert one of them into the hole of his ear; and let him jump on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone against the stone that is in the ear.
Therefore, he should not cease doing this with stone and stone, until all the water emerges.
And now the water emerges in such a way that you take one from papyrus, or from rushes, and insert one end of it into the ear; and set fire to the other end with fire, until most of it is burned.
Then again another rush, and do that many times, until all the water emerges; and extract it with a cannula according to what was previously stated concerning the stone.
In the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is of small body, like a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, which appears to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all those held in the ear.
In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you examine the ear in the sun.
If therefore anything of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
If however nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is the shape, narrow below, wide above; and introduce the slender end into the ear according to the amount that the sick person tolerates it; then suck with strong suction.
Do that repeatedly until all the worms emerge.
If however they do not yield to you for exit, then smear the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the section on stones.
If they do not emerge with what we have said, then administer the distillations which the ancients have already tested in the destruction of worms, and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring of oil and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
As you see, make it from silver, or bronze, narrowed at the bottom, with a small hole at the bottom, wide at the top.
Let the impelling thing that is in the concavity of the cannula be made of bronze, well made.
And if you wish, take a ray, and wrap linen around the end of it with a fitting wrapping, then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you wish from these, into the cannula, and let it be in the ear; then insert the ray with the linen on top, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is propelled into the cavity of the ear, and the sick person feels it inside; and that which is poured into the ear should be warmed with fire for a short time, and beware that the thing being distilled into it is not too cold; for medicines do not tolerate that.
Concerning the treatment of sudden ear blockage.
Chapter VII.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And it also happens to some people that blockage in the ear canal is caused by a wound or a growth of flesh in it.
And this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the ear cavity, and is not accompanied by vision; and sometimes it occurs near the outer part of the ear cavity, and is accompanied by vision.
Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which the gaze cannot comprehend, is, in most cases, difficult to cure.
And for that which is accompanied by vision, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and look at it. Then if you see the obstruction, open it with a fine probe, whose shape is as follows: its end should have a small width, part of which is pointed; and the rest of the probe should have two smooth sides, so as not to injure the ear.
If, therefore, the blockage is from flesh growing in the ear canal, then grasp it with a fine hook and cut it off easily and forcefully until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, then take a slender, smooth rod and warm it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
If, therefore, you perceive a blockage, with the patient experiencing difficulty in hearing, attempt to open it gently, and beware of injuring the ear's nerves.
Then apply a bandage to the ear, according to the size of the wound, wrapped in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days until you are sure of the wound's healing.
Or take a bandage and soak it in rose water, and sprinkle crushed zegi powder on it, and use it.
If you see the ear already suppurating, then you must remove the bandage and replace it with another bandage wrapped in a cloth made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides. Then treat it until it heals.
However, if a hemorrhage occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water, and place it over the ear.  And use the remaining treatment, which stops bleeding, as described in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of Altheli's eyelids.
Chapter VIII. These Altheli that occur in the eyelids of the eye are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you must grasp them with forceps, or with a hook, and cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Then place on the affected area ground zegi.
If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lenticular cautery.
And cauterizing them is better after incision.
For they often return when something remains from their roots.
And when cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of the large swellings of the eyelids of the eye.
Chapter IX.
Often something occurs in the eyelids that is similar to a swelling in its strength and hardness, and because of that it is called a swelling: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore the operation on them is that you should consider then, if it is a swelling proceeding in what appears of the eyelid, and moves in every direction, and its matter is easy.
Therefore make a slit over it along its width.
Then scrape it away from every side with ease, until it is gone.
Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
If however the removal of it is not prepared for you, unless after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision for a short while, then that harms the sick person in some way.
If however the slit is large: then gather it together with stitches: and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it and causes it to become flesh.
And if the growth is sloping towards the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the growth with a hook; besides which you will need an incision, and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is lengthened by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Then wash the eye after the growth's incision, with salt water; and treat the place with that which causes it to become flesh, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of eyelid growths.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is a fat that is produced in the tissues of the upper eyelid; and it most often happens to children.  And it weighs down their eyes, and they experience catarrhs in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight, because tears rush to them, and because of that you see them always lying on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids beneath their eyebrows are moist, which the swelling has already covered.  And the protruding Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the method of operation is that the sick person should place his head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare a bandage on it, and make a circle from that bandage according to the amount that Axirnath occupies on all sides.
Then place it on top, and press with your fingers on all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Then find in the middle of that moisture with a scalpel, incisions across the width, and let the incision not be greater than that made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or it is necessary that you cut through the entire skin, until you reach the Axirnath, for in many cases the Axirnath proceeds from the incision like a piece of white fat.
Therefore extract it with the cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers on the outside; and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and be careful not to insert further into the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the scalpel and injure it.
If, however, the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you add slightly to the incision with ease until the Axirnath proceeds.
Then extract it, as we said.
Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the area, and bind it with bandages.
And of men are some who rub salt, and place it in the concavity of the incision, so that what remained of that moisture may liquefy.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If however a hot abscess occurs in the place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Concerning the methods for ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, causing it to wrinkle improperly.
Chapter XI.
When additional hairs grow in the eyelids, beyond the natural course of hairs, and persist: then they harm the eye and cause various ailments, such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and cloudiness, until it becomes a cause of the eye's destruction.
And indeed, ataxmir of the eye is treated according to four methods. Or by cautery with fire.
Or with a sharp medicine, as was previously described in the chapter on cautery.
Or ataxmir is treated by incision and suture.
Or by tubes, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your bosom.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it turns, it is good.
And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle with the thread penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upward with the eyelid, and turn it with a rod.
Then find in the inner part of the eyelid beneath the hairs, adding with a spatula running from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then pull out the thread, and place beneath the eyelid a small cushion of cotton, or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with ink, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that it be shaped according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since it is already diversified in people.
For among them there are those who need a large amount cut from the eyelid, according to the amount softened by the eyelid. Then, with a spatula, find above the two lines that you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the fissure be near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a ray.
Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then scrape it all off. Then bring together the two lips with a suture, using a needle and fine wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and cause that which is left over from the threads above the two eyebrows to adhere, with certain invisible substances, if you wish to do this; and if not, do not worry.
Then leave the suture and threads for up to three or four days; afterwards, treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with that which dries and constricts it.
For the eyelid is raised at the sealing and bringing together of the wound: but it will be better.
The ancients taught this method of treatment.
However, there is concern for the sick person in it, and it is from good treatment, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a shape which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate hooks, or aggregated, according to this form that follows, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equality of incision.
If, however, it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal to that: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it into the middle of the shape; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and bring together the threads between your fingers with equality.
Then raise your hand with equal elevation, and raise the skin upon which the mark is made, as we have narrated.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture, and care for it until it is healed.
If, however, an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with caeroto, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that its hairs are turned.
Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
And it is, that you turn the eyelid, and cut the fissure that is within, according to what I have described.
Then make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood, whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of the spatula: and you have already incised at the extremities of each on both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully attach each to the excess of the eye's eyelid, and tightly bind the two reeds from both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for a few days. For the tight skin will die and turn black and putrefy until it falls away by itself.
If, therefore, it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Then treat it until it is healed.
When, therefore, it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the shape of two canes, which you shall make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
Concerning the raising of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The operation in it is, that you should take a fine needle, and introduce into it a fine, smooth thread of silk. Then tie its ends, and make a very small knot on each: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place another fine thread underneath it in the Alinxotati, and tie its ends if you wish.
Then let the patient place his head in your lap, and be near the sun so that the operation may be revealed: because it is a delicate, or small, operation.
Then introduce the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out over the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up over the alinxotati: and introduce that hair into the alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then draw your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the alinxotati into the eyelid with the natural hair.
If however the alinxotati is pulled, and the hair does not emerge with it: pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread that you have placed in it, until the alinxotati emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with your eye: then you will pull the alinxotati and the thread: and remove both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
If however the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and lift it with it: or leave it, until it lengthens after a time, and then lift it.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental therefore it arises from the consolidation of a wound, or a cutting, or a cautery, and things similar to them.
And the method of treatment in it is that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and place in that which is between them a linen lint, and tie it, until it is healed.
And you should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict; for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather, use in it things that soften, such as Greek hay; and embrocate with water in which althea, flaxseed, has been boiled; and with diaquilon ointment, which has been liquefied with some of the oils; and wrap with it a linen lint, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you should strive with all your ingenuity that it does not consolidate, according to the form which was at first.
And this operation which we have said, is indeed only a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the shape of the place does not return according to what it was entirely. Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati, which occurs lower down, is the one truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental kind arises from a wound, or fissure, or cautery, and similar things.
And the method of treatment in it is to take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and to dip it into the flesh, and to make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the flesh at both ends.
Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
If therefore the eyelid's shape returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a radius, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it; and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle from them; until, when they come together, their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Then join the separated parts; sew it with wool thread.
Then treat them with what we said, of softening medicines, and with bandages, until they are healed.
And if a laceration occurs from the fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, even according to what preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we said.
And the summary of the treatment of the Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the Alxatrati as prepared.
For it has many varieties in form, and the skillful craftsman prepares it in whatever way is possible to him, until he restores the figure to its natural form, or nearly so, and the infirm one himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this consolidation happens in many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural functions.
Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the tip of the probe under the eyelid, and raise it upwards; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp like other spatulas, but slightly blunt, so that the patient is not distressed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and does not injure the eye with its sharpness.  Your incision should be such that you gently scrape away the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, and wash it with water; or distill onto it from a sieve, from dissolved ziniar with water.
Then separate the eyelid and the eye with linen; and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after three days, use a sieve, and with solidifying agents, until healed.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the prominence of the tear-producing flesh.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the nail is according to two modes. Or it is nervous: and it is similar to a hard, subtle sifac.
Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when touched with iron, or you try to take it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not stick to it.
And both species do not begin, unless from the larger tear duct, until it goes gradually, until it covers the vision, and obstructs the light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operating on it is: that the sick person should place his head in your lap.
Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand.
Then collect the nail with a hook of few folds, and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hair of a horse, or ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair until its end.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear duct flesh, so that there does not occur from its incision a continual flow of tears.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, or with thread, as we have said.
Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, whose shape is this.
And be careful that the spatula does not touch the horny tunic, and a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is pierced.
Then, after the incision, place some crushed salt, or a paste made from ziniar, into the eye, and leave it until the next day.
Then treat it with what is appropriate until it is healed. If the hoof is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor can a hook be fixed in it, then this type of hoof is often treated with medicines, and is healed as I have described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the sick person's eye, and take a fine, gentle, weakly sharpened spatula, according to this form.
And shave the hoof from above with delicacy.
If you see that it becomes thinner and breaks, and the shaving is imprinted on it, then distil from your hour glass into the eye a sieve made from ziniar, or from red sieve, or ground salt; and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the operation on it until the whole of it is removed.
Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye, for then leave it and treat the abscess until it is healed. Then repeat the operation on it with a lancet until it is healed.
However, if a fleshy protrusion of the tear duct is harmful to the eye with great damage, it should be suspended with a hook, and a part of it should be cut: and do not make the incision too deep, so as not to damage the tear duct.
Then drop into the tear duct a red ointment, or one made from ziniari, until it is healed. Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and the flesh grown in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes in some people's eyes, red flesh grows, either composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses against the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward, and resembles a rose hip.
And the treatment in it also is that the sick person should place his head in your lap.
Then open his eyes, and collect all that flesh with suitable hooks: and hold it with a single forceps, or tongs.
Then cut the flesh first, until all of it is finished with a scalpel.
And be careful of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, with which you cut it, be either with a scalpel, as we have described in the incision of the nail; or with small scissors, with which the asel is collected, according to its shape after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is completed, and the entire alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or distill into it a red powder, and similar corrosives from medicines; and place a cloth with egg white over the eye, so that it is protected from a hot abscess.
If anything of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which calms the abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
And do likewise with the added flesh that occurs in the eye of this kind.
However, it is necessary to avoid the treatment of every weak eye by a natural or accidental way, by operating with iron; and do not insert your hand in any of these operations, until you see that the member is tolerant of that operation.
Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII. Sebel are red veins that are woven over the eye, and prevent its vision from functioning; and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which the Sebel is present is strong, and there is no other illness in it besides the Sebel; then collect the Sebel from it.
And it is that you should instruct the sick person to place their head in your lap.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment; and let the hook be a thin double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded in one body, according to this form.
Then collect those veins with sharp scissors carefully, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they dissolve; and be careful not to injure the eye with the edges of the scissors.
And let your operation be in the middle of the day in front of the sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not cut anything except those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye green or red juice, so that its sharpness corrodes what remains of the scab.
However, if it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with something that soothes the eye's pain, and leave it for several days until its pain subsides, and be secure from a hot abscess; then again work upon it according to the same method until it is healed.
And this is the form of the scissors.
Concerning the reduction of a broken nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call a fistula, which you treat with a cautery or with a burning sharp medicine, according to the preceding account of it.
And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it: unless you should open over the abscess at its origin, and extract all the moisture and pus that is in it, until the bone is exposed.
When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness on it, then scrape it with an instrument of this shape.
And it is called a rough head.
Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like an as-zir, which is pointed with the point of a file, or with a sharp point of an al-iskilfer; and place it on the corrupted part of the bone. Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand for a little while, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do this several times.
Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand for a little while, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do this several times. Then restore the place with desiccated, astringent medicines.
If therefore the place consolidates, and flesh grows there, and the flow of pus ceases; and it remains for forty days, and does not renew, and does not become an abscess, and no accident occurs there; then you know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nasal opening, according to this form.
And it is, that you uncover the second bone with iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is uncovered, then take a drill according to this form, let its iron tip be triangular; and let its wood be a pyramid thinning to the tip, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself; and let it be near the tear duct; and move your hand slightly away from the eye.
Then turn your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the sick person feels it; by this, that he finds air escaping from it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore, then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh grows, and the place hardens, then the matter that was discharged outward returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter for the sick person.
Concerning the reduction of the prominence of the Eye. Chapter XX.
When the eye protrudes entirely, and no harm or diminution occurs in the vision, then it is necessary to loosen the patient, then bleed him, afterwards place cupping glasses on his neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then apply a liniment to the eye made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Then bind the eye over the plaster with many bandages.
And the manner of the bandages is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth is doubled over four times: make many from them; then place them one over another, according to the amount the eye needs: then bind over them with a hard cloth with strong constriction.
And repeat the cupping with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping, and leave the eye bound day and night.
If however the bandage softens again, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly: then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye has now returned to the layer of the cornea, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, and the bandages, and the constriction, and the cupping, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the cornea.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the cornea, and then protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of the cornea, and disfigures the appearance of the person because of it, and one wishes to cut it out: then the operation on it is as I describe: and it is to insert a needle at the root of the cornea from the lower to the upper part.
Then insert another needle, on which a double thread is attached, from the tear duct side, and let it penetrate; and leave the first needle in its position.
Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the cornea in a circular fashion around the needle, and tighten it tightly.
Then withdraw the needle, and place on the eye wool soaked in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread falls away with the cornea.
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound heals.
And sometimes the cornea is tightened from every side with a circular bandage of cloth, until the eye adds great prominence.
Then it is pierced with a fine spatula, reaching the depth of the eye, and the albuminous moisture runs out, and the eye sinks in, and immediately it adheres; then tighten it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Chapter XXII.
This illness, called Alcomnat, is nothing but pus that collects in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not the eye itself.
And the method of operating on it is that you make the sick person sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Then take hold of its head with your hands at two points, and move it until you see the pus descend to the lower parts of your eyes.
Then it is fixed, and does not descend, and the light is cleared: and let the sick person see things as he saw them before: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
If, however, the descent of the pus is not prepared by what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a slender spatula, and with it split the corneal membrane slightly at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea, along the rim, until the pus emerges.
When it emerges, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have previously boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of water that descends in the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already spoken of the kinds of water in division, and what is suitable for piercing, the words declaring and explaining it; then take that same thing according to health.
Then therefore it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands, square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye, and tightly bind it; then with your right hand, the eyelid of his eye in which the water is, if the eye in which the water is is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then take with your right hand a needle, if the eye is the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then place the tip of the needle near the crown, through the thickness of a ray, upon the apparent white of the lesser tear duct; then push the needle with force, and you will turn your hand with it, until it penetrates the white of the eye; and you will feel that the needle has now reached the empty place.
And it is necessary that the measure of the needle's path to the depth be the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye.
For you will see them in the pupil of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the needle to the place where the water is.
Then press it below, one time after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his vision immediately, and the needle in his eye.
Then rest a little.
If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, apart from the needle coming out.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not rise: then extract the needle with ease: and you turn your hand gradually. Then dissolve some of clear gem-salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it.
Then place over the eye a whole piece of lint, or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind the healthy eye with it.
We, and those of our time, place crushed cumin with egg white upon it.
If the needle does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from men whose eye is very hard, then it is necessary to take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Therefore, with it, scrape only the conjunctiva itself, and do not place your hand in the opening; and it is not except that you make a subtle passageway for the needle's location.
Then introduce the needle, according to what we have said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare for the sick person a suitably made sleeping place, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room; and prohibit him from all movements, and from coughing; and place his food such that it soothes his nature; and let him not move his head right or left at all.
And let the bandage be according to its arrangement until the third day. Then loosen it in that dark room, and test his sight; and have him look at objects.
Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not necessary to do this during the hour of treatment, or immediately after the incision; rather, it is necessary to remove it; because water ascends rapidly through fervent vision.
However, if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with whatever quiets the abscess, until it is quieted; then restore his sight, and place over his face an oral thing by which his sight may be governed under those days, while he is in that dark room.
Then let him emerge from the house gradually, and let him walk around in his own homes.
And know that in a zaltea a student is not excused from observation at times; then let him dare proceed with the operation.
And now indeed a certain one from those who are of Alayrach has come to us, who said that in Alayrach a magdan was made perforated, through which water is drawn.
However, I have seen no one in your land who has done this; nor have I read this in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the species from the magda, so that one who is ignorant of them may stand upon it.
Let them be made properly of bronze; and let their extremities be triangular with this same subtlety, and the tip sharp.
Forms of the magda.
Of the treatment of flesh grown in the nose.
Chapter XXIV.
Sometimes diverse growths of flesh arise in the nose, of which some resemble a scorpion with many legs; and from this is cancerous, stony flesh, of dark color; and from this is flesh that is soft, not dark in color.
Therefore, in that soft growth of flesh, not fraudulent or cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the ground, and open their nostrils, and insert a hook into that flesh; then pull it outward, and cut what you have grasped from it with a fine, sharp scalpel on one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
If anything remains of it, whose removal is not possible, then scrape it away with one of the fine instruments with ease, until nothing remains of it.
If, however, blood dominates it, or a hot abscess occurs, then oppose it with what is appropriate; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it until the blood is cut off and all the flesh is removed.
Then, after the incision, vinegar and water, or wine, should be placed in the nose.
If, however, the nose opens and moisture flows from it to the palate, then you know that it is now healthy.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate, as it should, then know that within it flesh has grown on the upper bones of the nostril, to which the instrument did not reach during the incision.
Then it is necessary to insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place a quantity of a finger, or less, between each knot; and let the sick person attempt to send one end of the thread into the nose with a rod, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it similar to a zither; and to pull on its thread until it reaches the caecum, and it emerges above his throat.
And often children in schools do something similar to this, with atoms; and it is easy for him who wishes.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that emerges from the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Then cut away the flesh with the knots that are on the thread. Do that until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread, and place in the nose, after cleansing the blood, a lint soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for three days, or more, until the ointment has corroded all that remains of the flesh.
Then place at the end of the matter, in the nose, a lead cannula, for a few days, until it heals.
If however it requires a treatment that will dry it up, use that.
For performing nasal douching, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or bronze; let it be similar to a small lamp, open like a seashell, and its passage similarly.
And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a pipe.
And the seashell instrument for nasal douching, let it be full, revealed; to which let there be a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil or whatever you wish from juices and liquid substances in it.
And this is the form of the instrument. Concerning the treatment of nasal warts.
Chapter XXV.
Often a wart arises at the end of the nose, and grows larger and larger with the passing of days until its appearance becomes ugly.
And therefore it is necessary, that you cut it off at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate the whole of it.
Then apply to the place either a cautery or a burning medicine that stands in its place.
If, therefore, its incision is delayed until it grows large, then consider if it is stony, hard, of dark colour, and with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
For I have often seen that when someone cuts an abscess, great harm resulted for the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in colour, and you see that its incision is possible throughout, then evacuate the infirmity, and cut it without fear, without hesitation: and treat the place with what dries and constricts, until it heals.
Concerning the suture of the nose, lip, and ear.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little help is provided by treatment, except in some people.
Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you should consider if it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then gather the edges of the wound with sutures; afterward, treat it until it heals.
And if the lips of the separation of continuity are already separated, and each part is healthy: then it is necessary to scrape away all the part from its visible skin, until it bleeds.
Then gather the two lips with sutures, and bind them tightly, and powder upon it the blood of the dragon, and crushed frankincense: and place above the powders a piece of a diafinicon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then loosen it, and change the medicine, and leave it until the threads cut themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of the suture is, that you gather the separation of continuity, either with needles, as we have narrated in the suture of the belly; or gather the separation with thread, as I have made you know.
Concerning the extraction of the knots of the lips.
Chapter XXVII. Many men frequently suffer hard abscesses like the seeds of herbs on the inner parts of their lips: and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore, it is necessary that you turn the lip, and open it over every knot on it, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it from every side.
Then fill the place after the incision with bruised zegi, until the blood is stopped.
Then it is washed with vinegar, and the place where there is astringency is treated with it, until the wounds are healed.
Concerning the incision of flesh born upon the gum.
Chapter XXVIII. Often flesh grows upon the gum, which the ancients call a 'bulging'.
Therefore, it is necessary to suspend it with a hook, or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to flow.
Then place on the affected area ground zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it will not return after the cauterization.
Concerning the removal of teeth with an iron instrument.
Chapter XXIX.
Sometimes rough, unsightly, and sometimes blackened, yellowish, or greenish crusts gather on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer sides and between the gums, until the corruption from them reaches the gums, and the teeth become unsightly because of this.
Therefore, you should have the sick person sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth where the crusts, and matter like sand, appear, until nothing remains of them, and similarly do for the blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other discolorations, until they are cleansed.
If, therefore, what is on them is removed from the outset by scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another, second, and third day, until finally you achieve what you desire.
And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes, many forms, according to how it is prepared for your operation; for the scraper used to scrape the tooth from its lower part is different from the scraper used to scrape between the teeth, according to different shapes.
And have these shapes of scrapers prepared, which you see.
Of the extraction of toothache.
Chapter 30.
You must treat the tooth from its pain with all skill, and be slow in its eradication.
For there is nothing to replace it when it is eradicated, since it is a superior substance; until, when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary when the sick person is compelled to eradicate it, in order to be strengthened, and that the aching tooth is certified to you.
For pain often deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in the tooth's substance and eradicates it; then the pain does not recede, until the sick person's tooth is eradicated.
For we have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is certified to you, then you must scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side; then move it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps at first slowly, until you break it.
Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and the sick person's head between your knees; what you have already held firmly, so that it does not move; then pull the tooth in a straight line, so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take some of those instruments, and insert it underneath it from every side with ease, and try its movement, as you did at first.
If however the tooth is perforated or corroded, then you must fill that hole with cloth; and bind it with the end of a thin reed, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction upon it with the forceps.
And it is necessary to carefully perform the scarification around the gum on every side very much.
And maintain your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the sick person from that malice which is greater pain than his first.
And beware, lest you do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and their boldness in eradicating it, beyond what we have described.
For many times they cause great illnesses in men, which are more difficult to break, and their roots remain all, or some of them; or that they extract it with some of the jawbones, as we have often witnessed. Then it should be rinsed after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt. If a flow of blood occurs from the sites (for it often happens), then grind some zegi and fill the site with it; and if not, cauterize it if zegi does not help you.
The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick, so that they do not double when pressed on the tooth.  They should be like those with thick handles, such that when you tighten them they do not give way or double; they should have short extremities and be made of strong iron, or good falid steel, with straight extremities.  And on their extremities there should be teeth, some entering others, and tightening with a proper, strong constriction.
And sometimes the extremities are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork, and are of strong constriction.
Concerning the removal of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
Chapter XXXI.
When, during the removal of a tooth, a fragment remains, then it is necessary to apply a poultice of butter to the site for one or two days, until the area softens.  Then introduce forceps or pliers, whose extremities are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork.
The shape of these forceps is...
Their extremities should be made like a file inside, or like an aliskilfegi.
If, therefore, it does not yield to extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary to carefully expose the root and remove all the surrounding flesh, and to introduce an instrument called a small lever, whose shape is this.
Let it have a short, somewhat thick extremity, and not be overly thin so as not to break.
If the root comes out with that, it is good; and if not, one must assist with other instruments, whose forms are these.
The first has a triangular extremity, with some thickness.
A triangular extremity, thin.
Also, it is helped with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this. And with other instruments and tools that preceded in the arrangement of the teeth.
Also, let there be help with this instrument, which resembles a large hook, of this form, a twisted triangular extremity, in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break, and let it not be soaked.
And know that there are many instruments for teeth; and likewise, the remaining instruments are not counted, and a skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument, according to which the operation and the illnesses themselves indicate to him.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not name an instrument, due to the diversity of their kinds.
If, however, a bone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies, then probe it in its place with whatever is suitable for it from the instruments and forceps that I have described in the extraction of roots, and help with a lever, the form of which is this.
Let there be something of thickness in it gradually, so that the bone is tightened or held with it, and does not flee or go away, until the bone comes out; and restore the place with suitable medicines for it.
If, however, there is a small decay in the bone, then scrape it from its decay, and treat it until it is healed.
Of the sawing of prominent teeth above others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an ugly form is made by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely, those who are sexually available.
For if a tooth has grown after another tooth, and is not positioned correctly, or its sawing or filing is possible, then remove it; and if it is joined to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is this.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of tempered iron, with a very sharp end.
And let your incision, by which you cut it, be over many days, and because of the tooth's hardness, and so that another tooth is not moved.
If however it is prominent, exposed to its filing: then file it with a file of tempered iron, whose form is this.
Let the entire thing be of tempered iron, and its handle of small, very fine points, like the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then smooth it, and finally scrape it with some scrapers.
If a tooth has a broken part that injures the tongue: then it is necessary to file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made level, and even, and does not injure the tongue, nor impair speech.
Concerning the retention of teeth with gold wires.
Chapter XXXIII.
When the anterior teeth are injured and loosened by a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on what they eat without them falling out, and you have treated them with astringent remedies, and the treatment has not been effective: then the remedy is to bind them with gold wire, since silver becomes green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
And let the wire be of medium fineness and thickness according to the amount needed to fit between the teeth.
And the method of retention is to take a wire and insert a double length of it between two healthy teeth; then weave the two ends of the wire between the loosened teeth, whether one or more, until you reach a healthy tooth on the other side with the weaving.
Then repeat the weaving back to the starting point, and tighten your grasp with skill and intelligence until it is firmly fixed; and let your tightening of the wire be near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Then cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors; and bring them together and twist them tightly; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loosened tooth, so that they do not harm the tongue; then let it remain firmly fixed in place.
If, however, it comes loose or is cut, tighten them with another wire, and it will remain secure throughout this time.
And this is the method for teeth, and the manner of retention for two healthy teeth and two loosened teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that a tooth, or two, returns to its place after being displaced, and is retained as we have described, and remains; and only a skilled, prudent, and experienced craftsman can accomplish this.
And sometimes a piece of bone is fitted: and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the space, by which the tooth is strengthened and tightened, as we said: and it remains, and serves it for a long time.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue and hinders speech.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
If there is hardness and knotting in it, and it is from the healing of a wound: then apply a hook to it, and split it through its width, until you cut the ligament, and the knotting is released.
If a flow of blood occurs, then place pounded zeeg on the area. If, however, blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a freckled cautery, which is suitable for it.  Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed. On the extraction of a Ranula, which occurs under the tongue.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue resembling a small frog, hindering the tongue from its natural function.  And perhaps it grows so large as to fill the mouth.
If therefore you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, and the infirm person finds no feeling in it: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert a hook into it, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from every part.
If blood overcomes you during your operation, then place crushed zegi upon it until the blood is stemmed; then return to your operation, until you extract it with its entirety.
Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and treat it with the appropriate remaining treatment for it, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then either you will pierce it, or it will burst by itself.
And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is thin, then it is necessary to cut it.
And the operation on it is that you should consider before its operation, if its abscess has rested completely with quiet warmth, or is diminished by some lessening: then, therefore, make the sick person sit before the sun, and let their head be in your lap: and open their mouth, and let the servant take between their hands, and press their tongue downwards with an instrument, of which this is the shape. Let it be made of silver, or of bronze, which is thin like a knife.
When therefore you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it, then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as you can, pulling out with it some of the tissues.
Then cut it with an instrument, of which this is the following form.
It resembles shears; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is directly opposite the other sharply; therefore, take care that it is made of hard iron, or tempered steel.
If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, of which this is the form.
One side should be sharp, the other side not sharp.
And after you have incised one tonsil, then cut the other according to this same type of incision.
Then after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If however a flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled: or the leaves of myrtle, and things similar to these from styptics, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Therefore, cut it according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I myself have already treated a woman from an abscess that had arisen between her throat, which was drawing towards blackness, few sensations, which had almost completely closed her throat: and the woman was breathing with a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her to eat and drink water: and she had already reached death if she had remained another one or two days.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had sent out two branches, until they had emerged above the two nostrils.
Therefore I quickly hastened and fixed a hook in one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril.
Then I did the same to that which proceeded from the other nostril.
Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook into the abscess; then I cut a piece from it, and only a little blood ran from it; therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took food.
Therefore I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times for a long time, and the abscess succeeded in the place of that which I cut, until it was prolonged too much with it.
Therefore I devised and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore she stood apart; then I walked away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
Concerning the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Chapter XXXVII.
When a discharge descends to the uvula, and it becomes abscessed and is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part, thick, round, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we have said in division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the hot abscess has calmed from it, and it is thin; then it is necessary that you incise it.
And what is gathered from it, round, and has no length, and is blood-red, or dark-colored, or black, and has no sensation, then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
For there is fear over the sick person in it.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I have described, by its whiteness and length, you should have the sick person sit facing the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument of which the description preceded; then fasten a hook into the grape, and pull it downward; and incise it with one of the two instruments I have described in the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary not to incise from it except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you incise from it more, you will injure the voice and speech.
Then after the incision, use that which we have narrated in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it heals.
If, however, the sick person is terrified by the incision, then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
And the method of the cautery on it is not, except with sharp water; and it is, that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then press his tongue with the instrument that we have said.
Then take from the water that I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing, and make with it quicklime that is not extinguished, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, whose form is this.
Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be, like the concavity of a spoon's radius.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself: and let the sick person lie upon his side, so that saliva may run from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing may descend from it into his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you should hold it over the uvula for a half-hour's time, until you see it blackened and the biting of the medicine calmed down.
And if you wish to take some cotton, and wrap it around the end of the radius, and infuse the cotton with the medicine, and introduce the radius with the cotton into the cannula from above, until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve what you desire concerning the cauterization of the uvula.
Then leave it; for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it; and after cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and cleanse with it what is around it from the medicine; and rinse with cold water.
And treat it externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
This method of treatment is therefore more beneficial than incision and further from danger.
And sometimes the uvula is also treated with something more delicate than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, in this manner.
Take mint, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and mugwort, and similar herbs to these: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and soak them with vinegar, and boil them; and the pot should be plastered with good clay: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument should be placed in this manner.
Let it be made of silver, or bronze: and let the end, in which is the pomegranate, be inserted into the patient's mouth, until the vapor ascends to the uvula over the cannula, until the uvula is greatly darkened.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's arrival.
For it usually adds to the abscess, and it is not fitting that you should do it except at the decline of its hot stage.
However, if this instrument is not present for you, then take a cannula and place an egg shell on its end, so that the patient's mouth is not burned: because the egg shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is from good treatment with health.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract that which is apparent from them upon which the sight falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in the sun, and it is revealed to you what is in the throat.
And that which is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to induce a weak vomiting before the food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached thing will be expelled by vomiting.
Or let the weak person swallow a piece of turnip, or a piece of lettuce root, or let him swallow a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge: and let him tie it to a thread, then swallow it.
When therefore it reaches the place where there are the spines or bone, and is extracted, then it goes out. If therefore it does not come out with what we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be thicker than a radius a little, and at its end let there be a curvature, which he should introduce into his throat with ease: and let him have his head raised upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest cough befall him, and push with it the bone or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
But that the sick person introduce it is better, because of his knowledge of the location of the attached thing: and let him push downwards, or pull his hand with the instrument upwards, the whole of it according to the quantity that has been prepared for him, until it comes out.
On the extraction of a leech.
Chapter XXXIX.
When a leech is treated with what I have said in the division on treatment with medicines, and does not help, then consider in the throat of the sick person before the sun, or in the sun, after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument that I have told you about.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with finely made tweezers.
If this is not possible with them, then take a concave tube, and introduce it into the throat of the sick person, nearly to the gullet; then introduce into the concavity of the tube a heated iron with fire.
Do this many times; and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
If, however, it does not exit with what we have narrated, then fumigate the sick person with fleas, or with asa with the instrument that I have described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do that many times, because it will fall itself.
And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot in which are alive prunes with fire; and the pot is covered with a lid, in the middle of which is a hole; and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Then project the fumigation, and let the sick person place their mouth on the end of the cannula, and close their mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
For the leech will fall immediately.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salt and garlic, and not drink water. Therefore, it is necessary that it depart with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is drawn from the throat, when it falls over it to be seen.
It is similar to forceps, as you see: unless because it has this curvature that is inserted into the throat.
And its extremity is similar to the mouth of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and their general care.
Chapter XL.
Abscesses have many types, of many kinds, according to the account of them, that is, one, and one in this book; and they differ in the perforation and incision in two ways.
One of them is from the type of abscess in itself, and because it encompasses humidity.
And the second way is due to the locations in which it occurs in the body.
Since an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy location is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And of abscesses, there are some that should not be perforated unless after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion; and of them there are some that should be perforated while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion.
Such as abscesses which are near the joints.
Because when an abscess occurs near a joint and its duration extends to the point that what is around it decays, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; therefore, it is a more immediate cause of the contraction of that member.
Or the abscess is near a major limb; because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that [abscess] or through it the major limb.
Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it immature; and it is not appropriate to perforate a raw abscess, of incomplete digestion, except what is near the anus, so that it does not decay deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or form in its end something that does not heal. It is necessary to know the time of perforation of the abscess which has matured according to completion: and it is [indicated by] the lessening of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and acuteness of the abscess head; and the other signs. And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess, and of more vehement prominence; and let the perforation be proceeding in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of the tendons, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In those however which are reflected, proceed with the perforation along that member.
When however the abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better to leave its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to completion.
Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and nastiness, and perhaps its lips are hardened, and its depth.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the breadth of the body, in necessity; or according to that which the member requires.
And it is necessary, that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and a large perforation in large abscesses; or many incisions in likeness of the abscess's size.
And there are abscesses in which it is necessary to hollow out the skin, and to incise when it has already become like a cloth, and has come to an end, that it is already dead; like that which happens in many, as in boils, and buboes.
And from them are those which are cut with an incision having three angles.
And from them is that which is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like the groin abscess.
And from them are those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are administered, and similar incisions to them.
However, that which does not have a head, such as mild superficial abscesses, must be pierced with a superficial, or merely flat, perforation.
And when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, you should not be hasty and extract all the pus at that time; rather, extract only a part of it.
Then close the abscess until another day.
Then extract some more pus again.
Do this repeatedly according to a gradation, until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an aged invalid: for the animal spirit is often dissolved from the animal with the discharge of pus; and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, by which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply strips of linen or old cloth.
And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures in the perforation, then it is necessary that you insert a strip into every fissure, until they meet one another.
And if in the abscess you have cut away a portion of skin, or have hollowed it out around: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when a cloth is woven, or the down of flax is scraped without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary from the ointment, until it is healed.
If however, a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after which a cloth is soaked in them: and place it repeatedly on the site of the bleeding.
If however the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and in the divisions.
If however it is in winter time, and the area of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you insert cushions with warm wine and oil: and place them over the areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place cushions soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all of it cold.
Until when it will be the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess, and clean it, and administer in its treatment what is suitable for it, until it is healed.
This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
According to the path of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how there is a way to its treatment in separate chapters.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Chapter XLI.
Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the kind of Nodes, which are contained by membranes that are their sacs; as if they were the swallowed-up parts of a hen.
And their types are numerous.
Some of them are fatty; and some contain moisture like mud; and some contain moisture like gruel and porridge; and similar to these, and some of them are hard, stony.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, so long as in their incision the artery does not oppose it.
And the operation in their incision is to explore them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what they contain.
For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial longitudinal incision, according to this form.
And begin with an incision from line b to line g.  When the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the container which holds the moisture, and do not leave anything from it at all.
For it often returns if anything remains from it. Then immerse the cotum in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode that which remained from the container. Then repeat over the cotum with Egyptian ointment a second, and a third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the container; for then treat the wound with the ointment until it is healed.
If the abscess contains a fatty tumor, then cut it according to this shape, the incision having the form of a cross; and place hooks between the edges of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and exert your strength in removing the membrane that contains it.
If however an artery resists you, then do that which I will tell you afterwards.
And similarly do in the abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said. And the incision on a stony abscess is easier, because it has little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are on the head in some people, with which there is absolutely no moisture.
Or place a perforation of them always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus is eased downwards.
Then treat them with what is appropriate for them from the treatment.
Concerning the incision of goitres on the neck.
Chapter XLII.
These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And concerning those that occur in the neck from them, are single, and many: and they are generated from one another: and every goitre from them is within its own proper tunic, just as are nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the kinds of these goitres are many.
And some of them are stony; and some contain humours; and some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that one of them which you see of good disposition to the touch, whose proximity to the skin colour is evident, and which moves in every direction, and is not joined to the neck nerves, nor to the gullet, nor to the artery, nor is deep: you should excise it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body, from line b to line g, and scrape it from every side: and spread the two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said concerning abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is a precaution not to cut a vein or a nerve.
And let the scalpel not be very sharp, so that it does not injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick person, and you cut what is not necessary.
However, if you cut a vein or artery, or it prevents you from the operation, then place in the wound pounded zegi, or some powders that cut the blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens; or it begins to want to fester.
For the blood is cut then.  Return therefore to your operation, until you complete it.
Then care for it.
If the entire string is cut, then it is necessary to bring together the two edges of the wound, and stitch it immediately, after you see that no excess remains.
However, if you see that excess remains due to the size of the string, then it is necessary to attempt to cut its root and pull it out, and administer the suture we mentioned.
And whatever humors the string contains, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that the place of its ripening appears to you, and place the puncture from that which follows lower on the body, as we said.
Then, after the puncture, apply dressings with ointment, and things similar to them, to corrode what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound has now been cleansed, then treat it with a generative flesh ointment until it heals.
Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancients said this incision into the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it, and this is the writing of their words.
In those suffering from synanche, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided, as it does not provide benefit, because all the veins and the lungs are weak.
However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or the throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the channel, the incision of the epiglottis should be used, to avoid the loss that comes from suffocation. Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should cut the epiglottis below three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across its width, in the space between two circles, so that the incision is in the plica, not in the cartilage. And this place is suitable for the incision, because it is free of flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
If the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Then he should split the skin, until he reaches the channel, avoiding any blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should cut the plica, as we described: and the incision of the channel is indicated by the phlegm that comes out of it, along with the rupture of the same and the severance of the voice.
And leave the wound open for a time.
When, therefore, the hour in which suffocation is feared is past, bring together the two lips of the wound's skin and suture it alone, without cartilage.
Then apply medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it heals.
Says Albucasis.
The summary of this account we have given is not applicable unless they see that some of these abscesses have already filled the patient's throat; and the patient is raised above death, and his breathing is about to be cut off; they go to cut the epiglottis so that the patient may breathe over the wound with a certain respiration and be saved from death; and for this reason they prescribed leaving the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is of three days, and as such; then, therefore, they prescribed sewing up the wound and caring for it until it heals.
And that which I saw by myself is that a servant girl took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut a part of the lung's passage with it.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning, like the moan of a dead person.
Therefore I examined the wound, and found blood that had issued from the small wound.
Therefore I was confident that she had not severed a vein, nor a gut; and wind was coming out of the wound.
I therefore hastened and treated her wound until it was sound; and nothing happened to the servant girl, except hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to her better state.
Therefore I say: that there is no fear in the incision of the epiglottis.
Concerning the incision of a hernia of the throat.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called a hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is very common in women.
And it is according to two modes: either it is natural or it is accidental. In the natural one, certainly, there is no ingenuity.
The accidental one, however, is according to two modes: one of which is similar to fatty tumors.
And the other mode is similar to an abscess that arises from the knotting of an artery.
And in it there is fear, and one should not presume to apply iron to it, unless it is small; and you should test it and investigate it with an incision.
If, therefore, you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any veins, then cut it, as tumors are cut, and extract it with whatever it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then probe its entire extent.
Then treat the place with what is appropriate for healing, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision on the species of Tumors.
Chapter XLV. There are many types of tumors, and I have already described all their types in the division; and it is necessary to describe here the difference between a tumor and a fistula, since it creates doubt. Therefore, when a fistula is present, there is heat, fever, and severe pain until the boiling of the superfluity subsides, and putrefaction is complete; then fever and heat cease.
However, with a tumor, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains them in cysts, a kind of their own sac, and it is according to the color of the body; and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha, and larger or smaller.
And they are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture.
And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division. Therefore, when you reach the treatment of a tumor, you should test it and first examine it with an instrument called an Intromissum, according to the form that will come in the chapter after this one.
And the method of examining abscesses and all tumors is to take this instrument and insert it into the most moist place you find in the abscess; and you should rotate your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Then place your hand, according to the measure of the abscess's size.
Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider what comes out in its wake.
If, therefore, running moisture of any colour issues forth, then cut it with a superficial incision, just as I have described for other abscesses.
And if no moisture issues forth in the wake of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty; therefore, make a cross-shaped incision upon it, in this form, as I have taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and peel the skin from every side with ease; and if you can, keep the kistin upon it, to draw out the healthy part with the tumor.
If however, the kistin bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the healthy part, for this often happens, then extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
For if a little or a lot remains of it, the tumor returns most often.
If, however, it overcomes you and a little remains of it, then fill the wound at the completion of your work with certain sharp corrosive powders; and compress the wound, and place upon it a poultice of a hot abscess, and treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
If therefore the tumor is large, then suture its two lips and treat it with what causes it to heal by flesh. If however there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein, then hurry and fill the place with ground zegi, and leave it compressed for two or three days until the wound has putrefied and the boiling of the blood has ceased; then return to cutting that which remained of the tumor.
Concerning the instruments outside for cutting and piercing.
Chapter XLVI.
Among them are the forms of instruments, and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Let them be made of iron, with squared ends, well-fitted, so that they readily enter the abscess.
And these are the forms of instruments, and no, that is, perforating ones; and one of them is called beris, that is, perforating; and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and buboes from that which is between the bones among them.
And others are made round, smooth, and polished, like large needles with which saddles are stitched, namely of gold, or brass, or iron, or silver. And the best of them are those made of gold.
And black lead ones are also made, suitable for testing fistulas, whose concavity has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their smoothness in those reflections.
And they are again of three kinds. Because from among them are long ones, some are medium, and some are short, according to the amount of the fistula's width and its constriction. The shape of the hooks, and they are of many kinds. Because from among them are simple ones, namely those which have one curvature: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
And from among them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And from among them are hooks having two curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and from among them are hooks having three curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: because from among them there is a large, medium, and small one.
Their cutting edges are sharp, the other edges are blunt: and they are not placed thus, unless so that with them aid may be given in scraping knots for fear of cutting a vein, or nerve: and so that the sick person may be healed by them, and find a little tranquility from the burning that he finds in the scraping of an abscess.
These are great ones, and are of three kinds.
They are made of copper, and are similar to a radio, with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end a hidden spatula point is there: and in it runs towards the interior, and towards the exterior when you wish, as you see.
The shapes of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers in the perforation of abscesses: and the sick people do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
They are made of copper or brass, round, slightly elongated, as you see: and let them be of fine thinness.
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses be present with you, large and small: so that you may cut off blood with speed when necessary, and then when there is no medicine available to you.
However, do not use them for the removal of blood in every part of the body, and use them only on fleshy parts: such as the calf of the leg, and the thigh, and the calf of the arm, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes other small instruments like hazelnuts are made from them, according to their shape: with which blood is removed when it flows from a phlebotomy site, or from an incision in a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round in this shape.
Concerning the care of human breasts that resemble women's breasts.
Chapter XLVII.
Sometimes the breasts of some men become inflated at the time of sleep's completion (that is, when they begin to be defiled in sleep) until they resemble women's breasts: and they remain ulcerated and unsightly.
Therefore, whoever abhors that, should cut above the breasts in a crescent-shaped incision, according to this shape from line b to line g. Then scrape off all the fat.
Afterwards, fill the wound with a flesh-forming medicine.
Then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it heals.
However, if the nipple droops downwards and softens due to its size, as happens in women, then it should be cut in two on its upper sides with two similar crescent-shaped incisions, each contained by the other at the ends of each, until one line is larger and contains the smaller one, according to this shape from line b to line g. Then scrape off the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and administer what we said about sutures and powders, which is necessary from the treatment, until it heals.
If, however, you do not complete the incision that you should make, because of the patient's distress or due to blood flow, then you should fill the wound with a cloth soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Then treat it until it heals.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess, which occurs under the armpit.
Chapter XLVIII. These abscesses that occur under the armpit are of the hard Strophulus type, which contains cysts, and some of them contain moisture.
Therefore, those of them containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, according to this form, from line b to line g. When, therefore, everything in the abscess is emptied of pus, then fill it with old lint, and leave it until the next day.
Then remove the lint, and treat it with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
If the abscess is of the knot-like Strophulus type, then dissect upon it, as we said in the section about Strophulus equally.
If however the wound extends to emit pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we have said before.
Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs because of an artery and vein.
Chapter XLIX.
When an artery is ruptured and the skin over it consolidates, an abscess often results.  Similarly, an abscess and swelling can occur in a vein.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to an artery and vein are: because, when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, collected deep within the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a whistling sound to it.
And that which is due to a vein is round on the surface of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is an error, especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groins, and the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is also in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Therefore, for that which is from them, from the swelling of the artery's opening, make an incision in the skin lengthwise.
Then open the incision with hooks, afterward the Artery; and free it from its coverings, until it is exposed.
Then insert a needle beneath it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the Artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two Arteries that are in the temples.
Then pierce the place, which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood within it is discharged, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer a treatment that produces pus until the ligatures fall off; afterward, treat it with suitable ointments until it is healed.
If there be an abscess due to the incision of a Vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what you are able of the abscess with the skin.
Then insert a needle under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread on it, until you extract it from the other side.
Then tie the abscess with a good ligature, according to what I told you in the ligature of the grape, with two ends of the thread on two sides. If however you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the needle; press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is within it comes out; then cut off the excess skin, and let what is tied be from it.
Then place upon it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Then administer the treatment, which is done with plasters and ointments, until it is healed.
Concerning the abscess which arises from the twisting of nerves.
Chapter L.
Just as an abscess occurs in arteries and veins, so too an abscess occurs in nerves: this happens in them through a blow, or it happens from excessive exertion, and similar things: and it happens most often in the places of the auxiliaries, or the heel, and in every place where the joints move: and it is a serious abscess. Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain; and when it is squeezed with force, the infirm person feels in it a sensation like numbness.
And it is not a deep-seated, aggregated abscess, rather it is beneath the skin, and it moves to every part, and it does not go forward, or before, nor backward to the rear.
Therefore, those which are in the joints should not be incised with iron.
For perhaps contraction will result.
However, for that which is on the head, or in the forehead, split the skin with a spatula.
If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with scissors, and cut it away from its root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it off; then remove it, and stitch the wound; and treat it until it heals.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the belly.
Chapter LI. Certain people frequently experience in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies, growths which are called Fungalia, by reason of their resemblance to fungi.
Their root is subtle, and their head is thick, and their lips are turned inward.
And some of them are small, and some of them become very large.
And I myself have seen a man, and in his belly there were two growths, which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, with small roots, and their lips were turned inward, and they split, and moisture always flowed from them.
Therefore, I cut them, and found in the weight of one, approximately ten and eight ounces, and in the other, approximately six ounces.  And the procedure in cutting them is, if the patient is weak, moist, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with a subtle root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries present in fire.
For often a great deal of blood is expelled during its sectioning; therefore, if blood overcomes you, then cauterize it quickly.
If you see a weak, fearful, and timid patient from incision with iron, then take a thread made of lead properly, and tie it to the growth with it: by the method we described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the lead binding.
Therefore do not cease tying the lead, whenever it presses on the growth, until it is severed, and falls off by itself without effort.
If however the growth is large in its root, then there is some fear and dread in its incision, especially if it is in the abdomen.
However, it is possible to cut half of it.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it until the wound heals.
And beware that you do not presume to cut a growth that is of dark colour, lacking feeling, and foul in appearance; for it is indeed a cancerous abscess; and I will come to the remembrance of Cancer after this.
Concerning the treatment of the navel eminence.
Chapter LII.
The navel eminence arises from many causes.
Or from fissures of the skin, which is over the belly; and from it comes forth either fat or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood which flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been said before.
Or from constriction of wind in it.
If however it is because of a fissure of the skin, and the protrusion of some substance, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body; and it is smooth, without pain; and it appears in various positions.
And if it is because of the extrusion of the intestine, then its position, with what we have related, is of more diverse affliction.
When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it is greatly magnified at the entrance of the bath, and with great exertion.
If however it is due to moisture, it is smooth, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor is there an increase.
If however it is due to blood, then with these signs an abscess appears a dark-red color from the lower part.
If however it is due to formed flesh, then it is a serious, large, hard abscess, and it is fixed according to a single quantity.
If however it is due to wind, then its touch is smooth. And the treatment of it is, that you should consider then, if the prominence of the navel is due to blood of the artery, or vein, or wind: then you ought to refrain from its treatment.
For there is fear and terror in it, as I instructed you in the chapter where I spoke of abscesses due to the artery and vein.
If the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine or the diaphragm, then you should instruct the sick person to hold their breath and stand upright and stretched out.
Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Then instruct him to lie on his back between your hands.
Then encircle with a wide spatula around the navel over the place you marked with ink.
Then extend the middle of the abscess upwards, with a large hook.
Then tie it firmly around with thread, or with a silken chord, a strong ligament: and let the knot of the ligament be tightly bound.
Then open the middle of the abscess that was extended above the ligament.
If therefore you find it already caught by the ligament, then pull it out tightly, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly; and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook and cut away its excess.
If however it is an artery, or vein, that is opposite you, then surround it a great deal.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads; and insert the two needles into the circle you made around the abscess in the shape of a cross, making them pierce through.
Then tie the abscess in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh putrefies and falls away by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and putrefied.
Then treat it with what is appropriate from ointments until it heals.
If the protrusion of the navel is from flesh or a nar or moisture, then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess as we said.
And extract the blood or moisture you find in it.
Then treat it with whatever consolidates the place.
Concerning the treatment of CANCER. Chapter LIII.
For I myself could not heal anyone from it; nor did I see anyone before me who achieved it.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is to proceed and free the afflicted from the black cholera at times.
Then phlebotomize it if you find it with clear fullness.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which they will be placed for the operation.
Then throw into the Cancer the hooks which suit it.
Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to examination, until nothing of its roots remains: and let the blood run, and do not cut it quickly, but rather express the places, and wipe away the thick blood entirely with your hand, or with whatever instruments are possible there.
However, if the flow of thick blood from an incision in an artery or vein is contrary to you, then cauterize the vein until the blood ceases.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Dropsy.
Chapter LIII.
We have already recounted in the division of the species of Dropsy, and how the aggregation of water occurs; and the signs of every species, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites alone; and it is not approached with iron in the species of tympanitis; nor in the species of hyposarca at all; for that is fatal.
When you have already treated this species of tympanitis Dropsy with medicines, and your treatment has not availed: then consider.
For if weakness has already overtaken the sick person, or if there is another illness with him besides the Dropsy, such as if there be cough with him, or looseness of the belly, and things similar to those: then beware of medicating him with iron, for there is fear of that.
If however you see the sick person of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides Dropsy alone; and he is not a child, nor an old man: then the mode of operation in him is that you raise the sick person standing between your hands, and the attendant behind him squeezes his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a pointed spatula, according to this form.
Let it be of two sharp parts, long, with a sharp extremity like a spatula.
However, let there be something of shortness gradually, so that you do not proceed with it in the operation all the way to the intestine, and injure him.
Then consider.
For if there is a generation of dropsy from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend with the section from the navel a quantity of three fingers, downward in a straight line above the pubis.
If however the generation of dropsy is because of illness of the liver: then let your section be on the left side from the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let the section be on the right side; and it is also not necessary that the section be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Then pierce with the instrument the whole skin.
Then introduce into that section, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and if you do, as if you are scraping it: and let the quantity that is scraped be the quantity of a fingernail, or about that.
Then pierce, if so, until the spatula reaches the empty place: and it is the place of water.
Then extract it, and introduce into the hole the instrument, of which this is the shape.
And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: on whose lower part is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side: and the end of it is cut, according to the incision of a reed, as you see: on its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument arrives at the water, then it itself descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a medium quantity.
Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in an hour through the resolution of his animal spirit: or a syncope happens to him that approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the disposition of the sick person signifies to you from the strength of his pulse, and from his condition.
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
This is because it is immediately retained due to the skin that retains the opening which is on the sifac: of which I spoke, so that you might pierce it in accordance with that manner.
Then repeat the instrument on the following day, if you see the sick person tolerate it: and also extract a small quantity from the water. Do that for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until there remains little of the water.
However, if you fear for the sick person and release a great deal of water, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and much sweat in a bath and sun, and let him endure thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize on the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of water: according to what I recounted in what preceded.
Concerning the treatment of infants born with their urinary passages unperforated.
Chapter LV. When any infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the opening of its urethra is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or is in the wrong place.
Therefore, it is necessary to assist with its perforation immediately when it is born, using a very thin Spatumili, according to this form.
Then place a thin leaden nail in the opening, and tie it; and hold it for three days, or four.
When it then wishes to urinate, it is removed, and it will urinate.
Then return it.
And if you do not place lead, it is now possible that the urine which enters the area will not allow it to close.
However, the one whose opening is constricted is medicated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
However, those in whom the opening is in an incorrect place are injured.
That is, because the opening is at the end of the penis in those who are born: therefore, they cannot urinate forward until they raise their penis upwards with their hand. Nor is there generation for him, because the semen cannot reach the womb properly, and it is a very foul sickness.
And the method of treatment in that case is that the sick person is laid on their back.
Then extend his penis with a forceful pull of your left hand, and cut the head of the penis from the glans with a sharp scalpel or a sharp spatula, like the way one cuts a reed, or like shaving something, so that its middle comes out similar to the head of the penis, and that the opening is in the middle as it should be.
And beware of blood flow during your operation.
For that often happens.
Therefore, apply to it whatever stops the bleeding, and treat the wound until it heals.
Concerning the things that happen to the foreskin and the head of the penis, and its corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter LVI.
These conditions often occur on the penis, and there is a prominence of foul flesh.
And from it some are malignant, and some are not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook and cut away, until the entire area is cleansed.
Then place a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment over it. Then treat it afterwards with the dyaphynicon ointment until it is healed.
If it is malignant, of foul colour, then one should apply a cautery to it after incision and scraping.
If, however, the ulcer is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and part of it is inside the foreskin and part outside, then one should remove the ulcer that is inside first, until it is consolidated, then treat the outside part; because if you treat them both at the same time, the foreskin may be pierced.
And they also occur in the testicles, and the foreskin, as blackness and corruption.
Therefore, you should cauterize all that is already blackened and about to become corrupt, or that is already corrupt.
Then apply a line over it afterward with honey that has been mixed with the flour of pomegranate bark and crushed sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, namely for a flow of blood, and a wound when it becomes corrupt.
If the head of the penis is eaten away and the whole thing is destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra so that the sick person urinates over it.
However, in the adherence of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adherence does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon him: and sometimes adherence occurs due to a wound, or an abscess: therefore, it is necessary to scrape it with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
If it is difficult to distinguish them meticulously, then it is necessary to scrape away something from the head of the penis, and from the foreskin.
Because when the foreskin is thin, it is perhaps perforated quickly due to its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has already been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine until it consolidates. Concerning the cleansing of infants, and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Chapter LVII.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is from our operation, of our will, and its use is in boys properly, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation, and a gentler path leading to health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not state circumcision in any of their books, since they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experiment.
This is because I have found most craftsmen and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors; and they use the affected part and tying it with thread, and cutting with a nail.
And I myself have already tested all these methods, and have not found a better cleansing than with scissors and tying with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the outer skin is cut, and the inner layer remains; therefore it is forced to cut again to cut the other, and future pain will result.
And with cleansing done by the affected part, that is, by digital means, which the surgeons use, the incision of the end of the male member is not secured; because perhaps it enters its hole.
However, in cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron slips out and spoils your operation; and indeed the skin of a boy is of short nature, and they are often born in such a way that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen that.
However, cleansing with scissors, and the ligature with thread, has shown me a good experiment: because scissors are proportional to the incision; for this reason, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportional, and they cut according to one operation at one time: and a compression is made in a similar shape, encompassing the skin of the penis on all sides, with which no error occurs at all.
And the proper method of operation is, to make the boy, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, estimate that you do not do anything except tie a thread on his penis and leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way possible for you, from that which he receives with his understanding.
Then insert your hand into his penis, and blow into the skin, and pull it upward until the head of the penis emerges.
Then cleanse it from the impurities that collect on it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Then tie a second ligature a little below that. Then hold the lower ligature location with your index finger and thumb, providing good retention, and cut between the two ligatures.
Then lift the skin upwards quickly, and pull out the head of the rod.
Then allow the blood to run slowly (for it is better) and apply powder on top; and on top of the powder, a cloth on which the yolk of a hard-boiled egg has been spread in rose water, stirred with good fresh rose oil; and leave it on top until the next day; and treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
The shape of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Let the two ends be blunt, and let them be inclined, so that the nail's branch does not protrude from them; and let the length of the two sharpenings be equal to the length of the two handles.
However, an error occurring in cleansing is that perhaps the inner skin is entirely or partly escaped at the incision. Therefore, you should extend it from your hour with your fingernail before the abscess of the place; and cut it according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then remove it with a hook and cut it.
However, if three days have passed, and that which is under the rod remains swollen, suppurated: then leave it until the abscess is mature, and slough it off easily, and cut it as it is prepared for you; and beware of the head of the rod.
For it will not harm it.
Therefore treat it with that which consolidates a wound from the powders, which we have narrated in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut from the skin beyond measure, and extends to the higher areas, that will not harm it either.
Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
Of the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Chapter LVIII.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or grown flesh, and similar things to those which we have mentioned in the methods of treatment in the divisions.
And if the urine is not released, and you see its retention to be because of a stone which is now in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that he be weak, bent over his knees.
Then his feet shall be placed upon his back, and he shall extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and the weak man shall strain his breath as much as possible for him.
Thus, it is forced with the neck of the bladder to expel the stone backward; wherefore the urine is released.
If it is not released with what we have said, and the matter be severe on the sick man, then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave, like the quill of a bird in thinness, a radius in length, resembling one palm and a half: to which let there be a thin tube in its head.
And the way of the urine's exit through it is that you take a doubled thread, and tie to its extremity wool, or tow, a good ligature; and you introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe; and cut with scissors if anything of the wool superfluity, but introduce it into the tube with force, like a lever.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg; and make the sick man sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and its shaft with moist oils, and olive oil, and lukewarm water.
Then introduce the syringe into the shaft with ease, until it reaches the root of the shaft.
Then double it upwards from the navel's part. Then push the syringe inside it, until it reaches the Bladder, and let the sick person feel it having already reached the empty thing; and this is not done according to this order, unless because the passage, in which it goes, is in which there is winding.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
For urine will follow the wool.
Then pull it out, and make the urine run through the urinary passage; and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do it, until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief. Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a Clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
For it is deaf, that is, closed.
And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
And the hollow place, in which is that which propels it, should be according to the quantity that fills it without addition, until, when something is drawn with it, moisture is drawn out; and when propelled, it is expelled with it to a distance, according to what the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in naval battles.
Therefore, when you wish to project moisture into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw with what propels it upwards, for moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then introduce its end into the tube, according to what we have described in the syringe.
Then propel the moisture with that which propels it, for that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it. Form of a subtle clyster with which the bladder is clysterized.
Then introduce a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve. Then aggregate the circle, as a flat piece is aggregated: after you place on it what you want from the moistures, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Concerning the extraction of the stone.
Chapter LX. We have already spoken in the division of the species of stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have stated the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys, and the bladder, and the signs of it all; and I have stated the stone in which operation with the hand and incision occur; and it is a stone generated in the bladder properly; and that which is fixed in the rod; and I am narrating it with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Therefore, I say that stone generated in the bladder happens most often in children.
And among its signs is that urine issues from the bladder like water in its fineness; and white sand appears in it, and the infirm person rubs his penis, and labors with it, and often hangs down. Then it is erected, and the anus comes out with it in many of them.
And the cure of children is easy, up to the point where they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in the elderly.
But in young people it is moderate, in that which is between those two; and the cure is easier for one whose stone is larger; and if it is small, the cure is conversely.
Therefore, when we arrive at treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will extract all the faeces that are in their intestines; for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during investigation. Then let the sick person be taken with their feet, and shaken, and moved downwards, so that the stone descends to the depths of the bladder, or leaps from a higher place sometimes.
Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his hips, so that the entire bladder is inclined downwards.
Then examine him and touch him from the outside.
If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then hasten immediately with a cut over it.
If however it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe your index finger with the oil of your left hand, if the sick person is a child; or the middle finger if he is a full grown youth; and introduce it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it stands beneath your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards against the place whose incision you desire; and command a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another servant to extend the testicles upwards with his right hand; and with his other hand, to remove the skin which is beneath the testicles in the part adjacent to the place where the incision is.
Then introduce the Spatumile, which is of this form.
And find it in that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, but to the left side of the buttocks; and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision be wide externally, and narrow internally, according to the amount that it is possible for the stone to exit from it without being greater.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, presses the stone at the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
And know that the stone, which has angles and edges, causes its difficult exit because of that.
And if it is smooth, like a gland, and round, its exit is easy.
Therefore, to the one with angles and edges, add in the fissure.
If it does not emerge thus, then you must devise something over it; either to tie over it with a properly made instrument, whose tip is like the moon, which ties over the stone, and does not escape from it; or to insert a thin instrument with a curved end beneath it.
If however you cannot do so over it, then enlarge the hole a little.
If something of the blood overcomes you, cut it with a zegi.
If however the stone is more than one, then drive the largest first to the opening of the bladder.
Then cut over it.
Afterwards drive the small one after that: and similarly do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then ignorance it is to cut over it with a large incision.
Because it happens to the sick person one of two things, either that he dies, or that a constant dripping of urine happens to him; for this reason, because the place is not completely consolidated.
But administer its expulsion, until it comes out; or apply forceps to its fracture, until you extract it piece by piece.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place over it a cloth infused with oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water; so that a hot abscess is settled.
Then lay the sick person on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When therefore you have loosened it, embrocate the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with diaphantic ointment, and basil ointment, until it is healed.
If however it happens in the wound that a hot abscess is added, and corrosions, and similar things: such as if blood is congealed in the bladder, and urination is prevented from it; and that is recognized from the emission of blood with the urine.
Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt; and apply every kind of appropriate remedy for treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the hours of the entire treatment, that you bind the two hips, and bring together, for the sake of the remedies that are placed over the place.
If the stone is small, and is in the passage of the penis, and is fixed in it, and hinders the exit of urine: then treat it with what I relate before you reach the incision.
For often you will be excused from the incision through this treatment, for I have already proven it. And it is that you should take a perforator of iron, whose form is this: triangular end, pointed, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread, and tie the penis with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the perforating iron into the penis with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and strive to pierce it, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
For the urine is discharged immediately.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outside of the penis.
For it breaks itself and exits with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
However, if this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone on the penis itself between the two ligatures.
Then extract it.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
And a ligature of thread under the stone is not necessary unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and another ligature above, unless so that when the thread is loosened after the stone's expulsion, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and for that it is necessary to you when you tie the upper thread, to raise the skin upwards, so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we said.
Concerning the extraction of the stone in women.
Chapter LXI.
Little stone is generated in women.
If however a stone happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is forbidden because of many reasons.
One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin. And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or from those having husbands.
The third is, because you do not find a woman well knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: wherefore it needs deep incision, and in that is fear.
If necessity provokes to it, then it is necessary that you take a woman physician, well-knowing: and little is found.
If, however, you make her private, then seek a chaste, subtle physician, and present a well-taught female midwife in women's matters, or a woman who hints at a part of the art in this skill: make her present, and especially to her, so that she does whatever you command her from your inquiry about the stone. First of all, that is, that she should look if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
If, therefore, she finds it, she should constrict it under her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina of the infirm woman, and inquire about the stone, after she places her left hand upon the bladder and compresses it with a good compression. If, therefore, she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength, until she arrives with it at the root of the thigh.
Then she should cut upon it at the point opposite the middle of the vulva at the root of the thigh, from whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that area: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, constricting beneath it; and let the incision be small at first.
Then insert a rod over that incision.
If, therefore, she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision according to the proportionate quantity that the stone emerges from it.
And know that the species of stones are many. For among these are the small, and the large, the smooth and the rough, the long, and the round having branches.
Therefore know its species, so that it may be signified to you through this about that which you wish.
If, therefore, blood conquers you, then add pounded zegi in the place, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is cut off.
If, however, a flow of blood conquers you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which is cut: then place powder upon the place, and bind it with bandages of fitting constriction; and do not change it; and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Perhaps, indeed, the weak woman will die.
Then treat the wound.
Therefore, when the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone comes out.
Concerning the incision of watery hernia.
Chapter LX II.
A watery hernia is not present unless there is a gathering of moisture in a white sifac, which is beneath the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is called sifac. And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature has prepared for it in part of the egg, until it becomes swollen: which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we mentioned: and this does not happen except rarely.
And indeed the generation of this hernia is from the weakness that happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out to them.
And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. For either its color is sloping toward yellowness, or it is blood-red, or fecal, black, or watery white, and that is what is more.
For if it is in the white sifac that we spoke of, then the abscess is round, a little while in length, like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture surrounds it on every side.
And if the moisture is in the pannicle proper to itself, then the abscess is round like a part of an egg, and therefore a man estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the sense.
When therefore you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experiment with the color of the moisture in the abscess with the square Intromisso, whose form preceded.
Therefore, according to that which emerges in the track of the Intromisso, judge of that which is between it.
When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you command the sick person to be bled, if it is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then he shall be laid on his back upon a slightly raised object, and place many cloths beneath him.
Then sit you on his left side, and command the attendant to sit on his right, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles and to the part of the navel of the abdomen.
Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, almost up to the groin: and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sifac encompassing it: and scrape it and observe it, or beware of this, that you sever it: and let your scraping be, from the part that hangs with the egg more: and subtly examine with the scraping to the extent that is possible for you.
Then pierce the sifac full of water with a large perforation, and extract all the water. Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sifac upward, and do not touch the skin of the testicles encompassing it: and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either with its totality, or in pieces, especially its delicate side.
For if you do not thoroughly examine it, in its incision there is no security that the water will not return.
If however the egg protrudes externally from its skin during the hour of your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the sifac, pull it back.
Then bring together the two lips of the scrotal skin with sutures.
Then treat it like the other wounds until it heals.
If you find a blackened, corrupted egg, then it is necessary to tie off the vessels that are suspensory, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and remove the egg: afterwards treat it with what we have said.
If, however, water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore, cut the other part in the same way as you did the other one equally.
And if it is made equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do it: then wipe away the blood.
And introduce into the sections wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside another wool that you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the middle of the abdomen: and place over it doubled cloths, and they are pillows: and tie them on top with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Then take two cloths, and sew them together, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness: and let the extremities with which it is pressed be made of linen or damp wool: and let them be gathered with a constriction at the lumbar region of the breeches: and one extremity shall take hold upon the anus up to the back, and the second shall take hold at the side of the pubis: and two extremities over the two thighs lower down, and two other extremities over the two groins, and the whole constriction shall be gathered at the lumbar region of the breeches.
And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery at the site of the incision with iron: and it is as if you take a thin, knife-like cautery and you cut with it the skin of the testicles: and it is heated, as we have described: until when a whitish substance containing water is uncovered: then take the cautery, according to this form.
It resembles the Greek letter.
Then pierce it with that, and let it be heated, until all the moisture is expelled.
Then extend the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a heated, fine cautery, and cut it as much as possible, until you eradicate all of it.
And beware of the egg, so that the fire does not touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with a cut.
If however a contrary thing happens to you at the time of the incision, or at the time of the cautery, a hot abscess, or a blood flow, or anything else: then it is necessary to treat that which creates a contrary effect in you with the treatment that suits it, according to what has been previously mentioned.
If however the patient is fearful and does not expect this operation because of its horror, then administer a perforation as I describe it: and it is so.
When it is certified to you by what we have said about the signs that the branch is watery, then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatule, and make the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water runs out.
Then place a poultice over the location, and bind it, and leave it to drain the remaining water; then treat it until the wound is healed.
If however there is an obstruction to the flow of water at the time you pierce it, and this is only because a white membrane causes an obstruction in the wound opening and prevents the exit of water, then you should insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of the hydrops is extracted, the form of which has preceded; or add to the wound operation for a little while.
And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or approximately that time.
When it therefore collects, then it should be pierced according to the same method, and the patient will pass his days.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the incision upon this tumor, there is fear of leading to harm in many dispositions.
Therefore, it seems to me that its release is salvation from it.
And I remember the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
I say therefore, that many abscesses occur in the bodies, from which the testicles are composed: and that happens from many causes, namely. Or from an acute or acrid superfluity, which flows to the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it arises from the knotting of arteries, and their swelling: as its previous mention has already preceded: or from the swelling of veins.
Therefore, that which arises from the swelling of arteries is recognized by the disposition of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
And you should not touch it completely.
But that which is caused by the swelling of veins, nothing spreads from it upon compression with the fingers. And it is now possible that a section may be made upon this kind of swelling, and upon the remaining flesh: and it is like cutting the skin of the testicles.
Then extend the egg upwards, and extract it with a white sifach: and free the suspensory from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from all parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born fleshy tissues, then it is necessary to pull the egg and cut it. And if there is adhesion between some part of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary to free all that adhesion, and cut it with a round incision.
If however there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary to cut all of it, and extract the egg, as we have said. When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Of the treatment of Ramicis, which is with Vite.
Chapter LXIV.
Vitis is an abscess enveloped by some kind of wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles: and it causes difficulty in movement and exercise, and walking for the sick person.
And in the treatment of this illness, there is fear, due to the remembrance of that which preceded it.
But it is necessary, that we should say the operation on it according to what the first ones did. I say therefore, that it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Then cut with a broad, sharp scalpel, a transverse incision directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then scrape away from every side, as we told you in the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Then cut them in the middle, straight across, along the length of the body, and extract what is collected from putrid, corrupted, foul humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of the other wounds, in which the power of generating pus, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle may fall.
For there is no evil through it.
However, if all the vessels are affected, then it is necessary that the testicles be extracted along with the vessels, so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and becomes wasted or dried up, and there is no benefit with them.
On the treatment of intestinal colic. Chapter LXV.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle?
And this rupture is either from a sifach, or its extension.
And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
And a sign, when it is from the extension of a sifach.
It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly; and it is an abscess equal towards the depth; because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is from a section of the sifach, is that it causes a sudden and violent pain at first; and the abscess is different, appearing under the skin nearby; and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
And sometimes it emerges with the intestine as a zirbum; and this is called the intestinal ramex, and zirbia; and sometimes it occurs with flatulence.
And sometimes faeces runs into the intestine and is retained there; and it is with it the harm of the infirm person, because it causes a dull pain, and especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of these kinds of illnesses, there is fear with iron; therefore, it is necessary to be cautious in its use.
And the method of operation is that you instruct the infirm person to draw back the intestine with his hand into the interior of his cavity, if it yields to the withdrawal.
Then he should be laid on his back with his head between your hands, and raise his legs.
Then stretch the skin that follows upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Then place hooks on the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be, as far as possible, of such a size that the egg can come out of it.
Then scrape away the siphak and what is beneath the skin of the testicles, until the white, hard siphak is exposed on all sides. Then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, in the area between the white siphak, which is beneath the egg's skin, and the second siphak, and detach with it the adhesion that is on the back part of the egg.
Then move the skin of the testicles inwards with your right hand, and with this, lift the white siphak upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with the siphak towards the incision.  Order the servant to pull the egg upwards, and you detach the adhesion, which is behind the completed removal.
And examine with your fingers that there is nothing of the intestine wrapped within the hard white siphak.
If, however, you find something of it, then push it towards the lower abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread, made of linen composed of ten threads, and insert it near the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is beneath the skin of the testicles that follows the incision. Then cut the protruding ends of the thread until there are four threads remaining.
Then arrange some of them [the threads] over some others in a cross-like pattern, and tie them to the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong ligature, until no vessel nourishing them can send anything to them, so that a hot abscess does not result.
And place another ligature outside the first ligature, a distance of less than two fingers from it.
And after these two ligatures, leave a portion of the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, the size of a finger.  And cut the rest completely in a circular fashion, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, along the incision from which blood and pus flows, as we have described in the preceding text.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound. And apply the ligature that we have described.
And sometimes the white sifach that we have mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing blood flow.
For this often happens.
And leave the ligature until it falls away by itself.
If however its falling is delayed, then it should be moistened with warm water, and place upon it that which we have mentioned until it falls.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the wound treatment until it is healed.
Concerning the windy Ramice.
Chapter LXVI.
In this Ramice I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron for its treatment.
And the first, indeed, said that it happens as we have described in the Ramice that is with the Vine.
That is, tie the vessels after the incision, place them below with ease; then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with whatever opens it up until the vessels fall; and treat the wound, as we said, until it heals.
Concerning the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Chapter LXVII.
When rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the area bulges, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if it does descend, it is little, and returns every hour; but if the time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added to the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
And that occurs from the stretching of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we have said.
That is because the sifach stretches, then the area softens and becomes abscessed, and bulges.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as its previous description has stated.
And sometimes it is treated with an iron, according to this method: and it is so that the sick person lies on their back between your hands.
Then cut the abscessed and bulging place of the rupture, with a cut across its width, according to the amount of three fingers.
Then constrict the alsifak and what is beneath the skin until the white sifach is exposed, which is beneath the skin that follows it.
Then take a rod, and place it upon the bulging place from the sifach, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Then sew the two bulging places above the end of the rod from the sifach, and connect one of them with the other with a suture; then pull out the end of the rod.
And do not cut the alsifach completely, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, just as I made you know in the treatment of the intestinal ramicis. Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
For the sisach contracts, and no prominence of rupture is added.
And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter LXVIII.
Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because of which the flesh that is between them is softened, and its appearance is defiled.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to treat it, to make the sick person lie on their back, and to cut away all the skin that has softened, over the natural skin. Then he should bring together the two lips with sutures: and if you wish, sew first the excess of softened skin with three sutures, or four, and strengthen the suture.
Then treat the remaining wounds with care until they are healed and the threads fall out.
Concerning Castration.
Chapter LXIX.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and because of that I might not have recounted it in this book of mine; and its recounting is not necessary unless for two reasons.
One of which is that it should be in the physician's knowledge when questioned about it; and so that he knows the treatment of the one who suffers it.
And the other reason is that we often need to castrate certain animals, for our benefit thereby, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways. Or by attrition.
Or by fissure and section.
In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are dissolved and do not appear under touch.
In castration by fissure and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves some of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Then treat the wound until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite, there are two methods.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite is from males in two ways.
One of them is because there appears in it, in the area following, or in the skin of the testicles, in the area between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine runs from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one species, and it is a woman's vulva on top of the pubis, like small, entirely male testicles, protruding outward; of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of three species, two from males, and one species from females, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until their impression disappears.
Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In the second species of males, however, from which urine emerges, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure at all.
Concerning the incision of the Tentigo, and the protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo perhaps grows over a natural part, until its appearance becomes foul and unsightly; and sometimes it grows so large in some women that it expands like that in men, and reaches the point of coitus.
Therefore, you should hold the excess tentigo with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it; and do not be extreme in the incision, especially at the deep root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment for wounds until it heals.
However, the flesh that arises is flesh that is born in the orifice of the womb until it fills it; and perhaps it emerges to the exterior in the likeness of a tail; and because of that some early writers call the ailment "tailed.
Therefore, we must cut it as we cut tentigo, and treat it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of alratica, which is the unperforated vagina of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, so to say, a woman's vagina that is not perforated, or has a small opening.
And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from an illness that preceded it: and it is indeed made either from added born flesh, or from a subtle, or thick, sifach; and it is made either deep in the uterus, or on its sides, or on its upper or lower part; and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation.
And its knowledge is achieved through the obstetrician's observation, if an apparent obstruction is nearby.
If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a rod.
If however the obstruction is from a thin sifach, and is near the two lips: then hurry, and break it apart.
And it is, that you place cushions on the two lips.
Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs outstretched.
Then extend the two lips with strength, until the thin sifach is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it over the area; and let the woman do this every day, so that the area will not consolidate again.
If however the sifach is thick, dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a spatula wide like a myrtle leaf.
If however the obstruction is born of flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it; and have with you medicines that quell the flow of blood without causing a bite, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with the white of an egg.
Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound will not heal quickly, hold it for several days; and administer flax linen; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it heals.
And sometimes other fleshy growths are born in the womb: therefore it is necessary that they be cut in this manner; for there is no need to do the contrary with iron against a cancerous abscess in the womb.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red Bothor in the vulvas of women.
Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorrhoids are indeed an opening of the veins, until much blood flows from them constantly.
When hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil; and I have already mentioned their types and symptoms; and here I will say which ones receive a cure and which do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and are not apparent to the senses, then there is no treatment with iron for them.
However, those of them which are in the opening of the womb, over which the senses fall, are those which are cured.
Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cool house.
Then, extend the thelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then powder over them at the flow of blood from one of the cut powders without any mortification: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and things similar to them.
Then let him push her feet against the wall for one hour.
Afterwards, lay her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate bark, and galls, and similar things.
Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
If, therefore, blood is drawn out with it, it is good; and if not, make cupping adhere to the back and nipples, without scarification.
Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the wound.
When the abscess is at rest, then treat the place with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth, however, is reddish, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of harsh appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary that you cut away what appears from it, according to what I have said concerning the thelil equally, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of the exit which occurs in the womb.
Chapter LXXIV.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and inflamed ones, and alekilati, that is, herpes, boil, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and cracks, and thelil, and hot abscess.
And I have already discussed all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the divisions.  It is necessary to discuss in this treatise the hot abscess that occurs in the womb, when it is from those abscesses which collect pus, and you want to know how its opening is made with an iron.
Therefore, it is necessary to consider.
Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever, and you see it red: if the sensation falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps in its maturation, until when the sharpness of the occurrences ceases.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat that slopes with two seats, and lean, or be propped upon her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of her belly, and let her hips be spread, and let her place her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
Whose form comes in those that are after.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix it with the rod deep within the woman's womb: so that it is not that which enters from the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and injures the weak one.
However, if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you place pads over the surface of the womb's depth: so that the entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb is prevented: and it is necessary that it place the turning, which runs on the instrument, from the upper side, and that the instrument be held, and that the attendant revolve the turning, until the depth of the womb is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and it is touched by the hand, and is soft and gentle, then it is necessary to cut it near its head with a wide scalpel.
When therefore the discharge is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a lint soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the lint, and extract the section from the depth of the womb.
And place externally over the womb, and over the pubic region, clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then treat it after two days with the ointment that is suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed, so that they are cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of lily, or long aristolochia, has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden deep within the womb, then you should refrain from treating it with iron; rather, treat it with what we have said in the division.
Instructions for Midwives, how to treat living embryos which have emerged in an unnatural manner.
Chapter 70.
It is necessary for the midwife to know first the form of a natural birth.
Therefore, among its signs is this: when you see a woman pressing downward, desiring to smell the air, and feeling relieved of that which is upon her concerning the birth, and the embryo hastens to exit, then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is over her head, and the afterbirth with it, either suspended or hanging from the navel. Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her abdomen be pressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
However, that which is beyond this birth is unnatural, blameworthy.
For sometimes the fetus emerges over its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet and hand together, or its one foot, or its head and hand, or its belly; and perhaps it turns over its neck, and similar forms that are blameworthy.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, astute in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception: and I am showing every figure from among them, and how there is an ingenuity in it, and how it should be signified by it, and stand upon it.
When the fetus emerges over its head in its natural emergence, and it becomes strong upon the woman, and her labor becomes difficult, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her, and vaporize her vulva with decocted fenugreek and with moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small Spatumile between her fingers, and split the afterbirth with it, and cut it with her nail until that which is in it of moisture runs out; and press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
If however it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be enematized with fenugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Then command her after the enema to compress herself; and make her sneeze with spices, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
For the fetus will emerge immediately.
If however two hands of the fetus emerge at first, then it is necessary that you draw them back with ease gradually.
If however it does not yield at the entrance, then place the woman on a stool, and raise her feet upward; then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman is to be held so that she does not fall at the shaking.
If therefore the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies, then cut them, and extract the remainder of the fetus; and tie its hand with cloth, and extract it with equality; for it will emerge.
The exit of the embryo is above its feet.
When the fetus emerges above its feet, then it is necessary that you push them upward; then turn the fetus gradually; afterward, equalize it.
Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
When therefore they emerge up to the hips, then command him to compress it, and make it sneeze with condiments; for it will emerge, if God wills.
And if it does not emerge with what we have described, then return the fetus gradually until you place it according to its natural form.
For then it will emerge with an easy exit.
If it is prevented with all that we have described, then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound all in a mortar with good pounding; then smear with it the woman's vulva and the lower part of her abdomen.
Then make her sit in tepid water until the hypochondria is reached.
When therefore you see that her lower parts have become warmed, then make for her a poultice of myrrh, and apply it.
When therefore the poultice has held for one hour, then make her sit upon a seat.
Then make her sneeze; and bind her mouth and nose; and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle pressure.
For the foetus will emerge immediately.
The exit of the foetus upon the knees and hands.
When it emerges in this manner, then gently introduce her hands.
Then the woman should be placed on her back, and her feet should hang downwards; and she should lie on the bed, and fold her hands.
Then press gently upon her abdomen.
Then pull out whatever is under her feet from the cushions, until it is prepared at the lower part.
If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a vigorous motion.
Then press gently on what is above the hypochondria, until the fetus rises upwards.
Then let her insert her hands, and gently adjust the fetus: and tell the woman to contract, until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus hangs sideways from the hands.
Let his hand be inserted in the reduction.
If however he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman, and make her walk.
If however she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Then administer the liniment that you have prepared from the mucilages.
If she receives it through childbirth, then make her sit on a seat.
Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and adjust the fetus according to its natural form, and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself, until it emerges.
The exit of the fetus is over its neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is towards the mother's back.
The midwife should hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it, and straighten it with ease.
When therefore it is straightened, then place upon her vulva that which we have narrated concerning oil and mucilages.
Then command her to move gradually.
When you have done that, then make her sit upon a seat, and command her to incline to her right side.
Then command her to compress [herself], and make her sneeze with condiments.
The exit of the prepared fetus on the side.
When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture.
If it is therefore hanging over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel, so that it is not retained, and dies.
Then push the fetus inwards until you place it as it should be, and command the woman to compress herself several times, for it will exit by a light passage.
The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Know that twins are born frequently, and sometimes three and four are born.
However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
However, five is a thing outside of nature, and they do not entirely live; and although they multiply, they are contained by a single afterbirth, and they are separated by a sort of partition, tied to the umbilical cord of each.
And sometimes they emerge like a single fetus emerges through a natural, easy exit, and they emerge with a [that] praiseworthy exit, as we have recounted. If some of them are difficult at birth, and they arrive at the unnatural forms we have described, then treat them as we have recounted; and let the midwife be skilled, and do what she does with ease and patience, and be resourceful according to every shape, using whatever is prepared for her, with ingenuity leading to health.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb; and it has already been verified to me that a woman miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Which was done by the measurement of the glorious sage.
Therefore, all this should be within the knowledge of the midwife. Perhaps it will come to her similar to that one; therefore, let her oppose it with what is necessary.
Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division of medicine, and it does not emerge, and you are compelled to use an operation with the hand, then you must consider.
If, therefore, the woman is of sound constitution, and is not suffering from any of the accidents from which harm is feared: then the woman must be laid supine on the bed, on her back, and her head inclined lower, and her legs elevated: and the attendant must hold her from two sides, or she must be bound to the bed, so that her body is not pulled during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils with the mucilage of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and flaxseed. Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages, then insert it into the womb with ease.
Then let her seek with it the place where to fix the hooks from the fetus, and places suitable for that.
Therefore, consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in the places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
If however the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubic bone, and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand, and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of the left hand, and insert it with the hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places which we have said, until it reaches the empty space.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not be only in a straight line, but rather move in every direction, so that its exit is eased; as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it is necessary in that which is between them, that the extension be softened.
If a part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so as to revolve with them that which is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then let the hooks be moved to another place which is higher: do this until the entire fetus emerges.
If, therefore, a hand emerges before the other, and it is not possible to return it, because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Then pull it out until, when the whole thing emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint, or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary to do with the other hand, and with the two feet.
If however the fetus' head is large, or constriction happens to it in its exit, or water is collected in its head: then it is necessary to insert a thorny Spatumile between the fingers, and to split the head with it, and extract the water: or to break it with the instrument called Almisdac, the form of which comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that follows this.
Likewise, let him do this if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary to cut it with algengematu, or to pull it out with misdach, as we said.
Then pull out the bones with forceps.
If the head emerges and is constricted at the fork, then it should be split until the moisture in the chest is released.
If however it does not become entangled, nor yields to exit, then cut the head into pieces, as far as is possible for you.
If the lower part of the belly is suppurating or has dropsy, then it is necessary to pierce it until moisture runs from it.
If the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the mouth of the womb is gentle.
If however it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and to split the belly or chest until what is within them flows out.
If however the other limbs are removed, and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the womb, and seek the head with it, and pull it with her fingers until it reaches the mouth of the womb; then she should insert one hook, or two hooks, into it and pull it with that.
If however the mouth of the womb is constricted, due to a hot abscess that occurs to it, then it is not necessary to work on it, rather it is necessary to administer an effusion of moist, oily things, and to apply plasters, and to sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to correct it; then what we said about a live fetus should be administered.
If that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave nothing of the afterbirth inside at all.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about hot abscesses which occur in the wombs.
If a flow of blood occurs, then it should be dipped in styptic waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
And I myself have already seen a woman in whose belly a dead fetus was: then she became pregnant again over it, afterwards another fetus also died.
Therefore, a long time later, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
Therefore, I was called to treat her, and I medicated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Therefore, I placed upon it some plasters of strong attraction: and a bone emerged from the place.
Then a few days passed, and another bone emerged.
Therefore, I was amazed by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Therefore, I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Then I searched for the wound, and pulled out many bones, the woman being in better condition: and she lived thus for a long time, and sent out a little pus from the place.
And I did not consider this foreign matter, except because there is knowledge and assistance in it, which the skilled physician administers with the hand in treatment.
Concerning the shapes of necessary instruments in the extraction of a fetus.
Chapter LXXVII.
Here below is the form of a binder, by which books are equalized, which has two hinges equally on the two ends of two pieces of wood.
However, this hinge must be finer than the binder; and to make it, either from ebony or from boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood is about two fingers; and the edge of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same type of wood, which are now fixed on both, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the matrix's opening, so that it opens with them when you turn the two hinges.
The form of the hinge by which the matrix is opened.
Another form, similar to it, finer, and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
However, at its extremity there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
When therefore you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit upon a bed, with her feet hanging down, opening that which is between her thighs.
Then introduce these two joined additions into the matrix: and you are holding the lower extremity of the instrument between her thighs.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount you wish from the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Another form of Vertigo, which the ancients called the Impelling Form, by which the fetus is propelled.
The Almisdac form by which the small head is crushed. The form of a hook with one spine.
The form of a hook with two spines.
The form of forceps with saw-like teeth, with which the fetus's head is crushed.
The form of a scalpel with two ends for severing the head.
The form of two spatulas, also broad.
All these instruments are used, and the more their types are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker is his operation, and the more highly regarded by people, on account of their quantity.
Therefore do not despise any instrument, lest it be unprepared for you.
For their necessity is unexcusable.
Of the extraction of the Secondina.
Chapter LXXVIII.
When the Secundina is retained at the time of childbirth, then it is necessary to instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze with condiments, and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils.
If, therefore, it emerges by this, it is good.
If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid; and put in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, sea-scammony, cinnamon wood, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them over the fire.
Then place a reed plug over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end in the mouth of the womb; and hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
For the afterbirth will come out with ease.
If, however, it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage. Then she should introduce it into the vagina, and search for the afterbirth with it.
When therefore she finds it, then let her take it and extend it gradually.
If, however, it be attached deep within the womb, then let her introduce her hand, as we have described, until, when she finds the afterbirth, she gently draws it out, in a straight line, so that the womb does not fall from the sudden pulling; rather, it should be moved with ease to the right and left sides; then add to the amount of traction.
For then it yields, and is preserved, and escapes from adherence.
If the opening of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with a medicine of a pot containing herbs.
If, however, it does not emerge with all that we have described, then beware of tiring yourself out in repeatedly trying to extract it.
But that which emerges from it to the opening of the womb, must be tied to the woman's hip.
Then, administer an enema to her with the four-drug ointment.
For this will cause it to rot after days, and it will dissolve, and emerge.
However, when it rots, an unpleasant odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the infirm person.
Therefore, suitable fumigations must be administered to it.
Some of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which to fumigate a woman with retained secundines and menses.
Let it be made of glass, similar to an alambic, or of bronze; and let the wide end be placed over the fire; and let the fumigation be placed over the prunes; let it hold it until that fumigation is consumed; and again another.
Concerning the treatment of an unopened anus.
Chapter LXXIX.
Many children are born with their anuses unopened, which have already been filled with a fine sifac.
Therefore, the midwife must pierce that sifac with her finger; and if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula; and let her be cautious not to touch the [anus] with her wrist.
Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If, however, you fear that it will become blocked, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to expel it.
And now blockage of the anus also occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Therefore, it is necessary that the consolidation be cut, then treated with what we have said about treatment and lead. Concerning the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Chapter Eighty.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are swellings and enlargements that occur near the anus externally, or within the space of one part; and it is one fistula, or several.
When that swelling becomes chronic, it opens, and watery white moisture, or thin pus, flows from it.
And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
And some of them, when they are penetrating in the space, go up to the bladder and up to the urinary meatus.
And some of them are penetrating up to the hip joint and up to the tailbone.
From this, by which a penetrating fistula up to the anus, is known even from one that is not penetrating, is, that you insert your index finger into the anus; and insert a thin probe into the fistula from air, or iron; when there is no twisting.
If there is twisting in it, then insert a thin lead probe into it, or a hair from horsehair, until you feel the probe or hair in your finger.
If you do not feel it completely, nor does anything emerge from the opening in terms of excretion, nor wind, nor worms as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore, hasten to the treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder, or to the urinary passage: then its indication is the excretion of urine from it, and the prohibition of it from this so that the place may consolidate with medicines.
If however it is penetrating up to the hip joint, or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no twisting in it up to the bone; and the finding of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus emerges from it always; and that treatment does not work in it, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and the treatment of them is labor and futility for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed. In that which is not penetrating, and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a saw; according to what I narrate to you, and which I have already proved; and it is, that the sick person lie between your hands on their back; and raise their legs above their hips, and their hips be inclined towards their stomach.
Then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
If however the sick person feels it near the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into the anus.
If therefore you feel the probe already penetrated through itself, detected, besides what you feel between your finger and the said fistula, or flesh; then, therefore, know certainly that it is penetrating: so you shall not labour on it, because there is no cure for it, as we said.
However, they said that in some men the flesh is healed, and from the medication with which it is hoped for help, it is that you should heat a small cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been said before, and insert it heated into the fistula until it reaches near the anus.
Then repeat it twice or thrice until you know that all those added, filtered flesh, similar to the hollow shaft of a bird's feather, are now burned.
Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those burned flesh parts come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
If therefore it is healed, it is good.
And if not, then it will never be healed with another treatment.
And if the probe emerges, and does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the probe, or if so: and you see a fistula following the skin's surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go on cutting with the probe that is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the probe's end reaches, and the probe is released and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered tissues, which resemble the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
However, if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your work, so that you may cut those tissues, then it is better and more quickly beneficial to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Because cauterization with fire gathers good qualities, burning those added tissues, and removing the blood, and drying the moisture.
Then treat it with bandages wrapped in butter, or crushed herbs, until the area discharges pus, and those burned tissues emerge in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which produce hard flesh: and there are medicines in which there is astringency and drying.
For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear repetition. If, however, the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and extends from bodily excess: then insert your finger into the anus, and examine with it.
If therefore you feel a tension, and between you and it is a covering of sifac, or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation on it, unless according to the path of trust and hope.
That is, because one of three methods is administered to it: either to cauterize it, as we said; or to dissect it until you reach its concavity, so that it may be possible for you to insert bandages, and cure from nearby.
And do not proceed much with the dissection, lest you cut the muscle surrounding the anus, and an unintended outcome of expulsion occur to the weak. Then treat it with what we said. Perhaps it will be healed; or you will extend the covering, and cleanse it after you cut it close to the anus, as we said, either with a probe, or with another instrument with a sharp end.
Then cleanse those filtered tissues that are in the dissection, until you can get to it with scrutiny.
Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with dissection, and the upper opening where it is consolidated; and a fistula will remain open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you introduce a probe into the fistula, and it is on the side of the anus near the body surface with the skin and margin of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like an alef needle, that is, for preparing leather, according to this form.
And introduce into it a thread wrapped with five threads, and about it.
Then introduce the probe with thread into the fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
If therefore it penetrates into the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening: so that you introduce your finger into the anus and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together; and tie each, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread penetrates into the flesh, the better you tie it, until those flesh parts between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall out; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
For you do not have the ability to do that due to the muscle, so as not to damage it.
Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
Shape the pointed spatula with which the fistula is split, its curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not damage what is not necessary, as you see.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision; and the treatment of fissures.
Chapter LXXXI.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
For they are either within the anus, like bladders of charcoal or prunes; or like bunches of grapes themselves.
And from them are small and large; and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those outside the anus are mostly few and moist, from which runs yellow water, or little blood with constant flow; and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is that you command the sick person to strain: and it be squeezed out, until it emerges from the anus, and its hairs appear to you.
Therefore, also suspend them with hooks, or hold them with your fingernail.
Then cut them at their roots.
If, however, the hooks do not remain in them, due to their moisture and their softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a cloth of double wool, and extract them with your fingers.
Then cut them, and after the incision, sprinkle some hot powders over them, so that they stand in place of a cautery.
Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
If the anus does not yield to expulsion, then administer to the sick person an enema containing a small mordicant, so that it washes out what is in the anus, and it yields to expulsion quickly when the sick person expels it.
If, however, the piles are external from the anus, then their removal is easy; and it is that you seize them with your fingernail, or seize them with a hook, and cut them.
Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
And whoever abhors incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this manner.
Take a wrapped thread, and insert it into the needle.
Then draw the piles upward, and make it penetrate with the needle into its root on the other side; and wrap the two ends of the thread, on the lower part of the needle, and let them be laterally; and tighten the piles with a strong constriction.
Then tie the thread, and pull out the needle.
Do that with all the piles, and leave one of them; nor should you leave it, so that superfluity of blood may run from it.
Then place over the anus a cloth steeped in rose or cedar oil, and put it over the anus; and order the patient to rest.
Then leave it until it falls off.
When therefore the piles fall off, treat them with ointments and other treatment until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of Fissures.
For they often occur from the dryness of excrement and the constriction of nature.
When therefore they become old, and medicine is of no avail to them, then it is necessary to scrape them with a sharp spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper crust which prevents their healing is removed.
Then treat them until they heal properly.
If however they do not heal, then scrape them again with a more forceful instrument than the first, until they bleed a great deal, and are peeled; then treat them until they are healed.
On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted Almirmar, and of dried Athelil and Formicae.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously stated in its chapter.
From dry athelil, one is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence above the surface of the body.
And they often occur on the hands of children.
And its treatment is, that you stretch the athelil, and cut it; or tie it with a silk thread; or with a hair, until it falls.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been previously mentioned with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and thus are eradicated inverted athelil, and not inverted ones with the instrument that I will name. A formica is also a small, filtered, thick eminence on the surface of the body, going deep very much; and when it encounters cold, it is felt in it like a formica bite, and it happens throughout the body; and most of it occurs on the hands.
And its treatment is, that you take a cannula from a goose's feather, or a strong vulture's feather; and place that cannula upon the Formica, until the cannula's circle encompasses its parts.
Then rotate your hand with the cannula until you sever what is around the Formica; and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root. And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air, or iron, according to this form.
Let the cannula's upper part be at a height pulling the deaf wrapped [thing], so that its grip and its rotation on the finger are eased.
And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what is stated previously in the cauterization of Atheril in the chapter on the cautery.
Concerning the shapes of instruments that are administered to enemas in diseases of the anus, and for emptying the bowels, and for colic.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or of bronze, or of cast or hammered copper.
And sometimes it is made of these instruments small, and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of very young children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, so should their enemas be.
Large enema.
Small enema.
Its tube, that is, the upper end to which the uterus is tied, should be wide according to this measure; and there should be a distinction so that the uterus is tied as you see, and its lower end which is inserted into the anus should be closed, that is, not open, smooth, very much, drawing toward thinness; and on one side of it should be two openings, and on the other side one opening.
And the size of the opening should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker; and the uterus into which the medicines are placed should be of animal bladder, or of sheep's parchment, which should be in the shape of a small asofrat, its root being one palm.
Therefore, when the uterus is placed in it, it should be tightened at the head of the enema between two distinguishing constrictions firmly.
Then administer an enema with it.
And this is the form of the uterus here depicted, and the holes. The method of administering the enema with it is: to fill the pouch or bladder with medicine that is heated according to the patient's tolerance; and beware that it is not too hot or too cold.
Then the patient should lie on their back, and raise their legs upwards; and place under them a *inthaan*, that is, a skin upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the end of the enema with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or similar substances.
Then insert it into the anus gently.
Then let the attendant grasp the pouch with both hands simultaneously, and express it with force, until all that is in the enema is evacuated into the intestine. Then withdraw the enema, and let the patient raise their legs to the wall. If the medicine compels him toward an outcome, then let him hold it as long as possible.
And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more useful in the end.
If, however, you administer enemas in illnesses of the belly's discharge, and his outcome is hasty: then repeat the enema, until he is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or sores damaging the anus, then let the enema be very thin, gentle, from the enemas with which children are enemated.
And this should be the form of a thin enema on which the skin is tight.
On the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds that it was appropriate for the book, and I will say here their treatment with the hand, and with remedies according to the completion.
I say therefore, that wounds are diversified according to that by which the wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
The things by which wounds are made are often like a stone's throw, or a cut of a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or wood, or an arrow, and with similar things from many objects.
And the wounds that are made according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver; and similar ones from those members.
And I am narrating the treatments of some wounds, so as to set forth that reasoning and rule upon the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with the simple wounds of the head, since the remembrance of the composite ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: then consider, if it is from the throwing of a stone, or similar things, and it has only broken the skin: and is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hasten, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately; and do not delay it; and extract from him blood according to the quantity of his strength; if there is nothing preventing it from phlebotomy, especially if the blood that exits from the wound is small.
And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the sick person abstain from repletion, and wine, and heavy foods.
If, however, something prevents diminution, then let the food be lessened, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And if a hot abscess occurs on the wound, place on it a poultice steeped in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
If, however, you are sure of a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent with its own blood, and the air has not altered it, the powder which I will describe shortly: and if the air has already altered it, then apply certain ointments until it heals.
If, however, the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things; and its edges do not come together through compresses, then bring them together with stitches, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly regarding their stitching.
If, however, the wound has already been detached from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspensory, then cut it.
Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore to it hard flesh in place of skin, and command the sick person to be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads [of animals] and cooked wheat, until it is like paste; and similar things.
If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away the entire putrefied part and throw it away; then treat it.
If, however, in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows; and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate the artery.
If therefore you find it not severed, then sever it with a Spatumili, or tie it.
If necessity compels it when what we have said is not helpful, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped.
Method of the flesh-producing powder.
Take one part of olibanum, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: let the whole be finely ground, and sifted: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it, and clots with the blood.
Then bind it above with bandages, and leave it, nor loosen it while it remains, so that it does not fester.
For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Then treat the rest with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Of wounds of the neck.
Chapter LXXXV.
If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference between it in treatment, and between a wound of the head when it is simple.
If, however, the nerve of the neck, or artery, has been cut: then, if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except to avoid treatment of it with that which produces a strong astringency, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Because they harm the nerves and contract them.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that with which it is treated be gentle from medicines, such as lime washed with sweet water, infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tuthia, when it is also washed with sweet water; and the other mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
If, however, the wound is large, then administer sutures: or constrict its edges with poultices.
Then treat it until it heals.
If however the wound has depth, or a sinus has occurred in its lower part, in which pus has already accumulated, then pierce it in the most depressed place in it.
If, however, an artery has already been cut in the wound, and its blood flow has followed: then separate, or cut it, and tie it: or cauterize it, if necessity prompts it.
If, however, the cartilages of the throat, or the whole throat, have been cut, and the rest of the throat is preserved: then bring together the edges of the skin with sutures on the stick of the throat, and do not touch the throat itself, rather align it and return it to its natural shape.
Then bind it with a decent constriction, and leave it for some days.
Then treat it with ointments containing astringency and drying, until it is healed.
If, however, the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then investigate it: then, if there are fragments of bone within it, remove all of them, or as many as you can: and leave what is not removed until the wound rots, and its exit is separated and eased.
If the wound is recent, then powder the area with the powder I described.
If, however, bone is seen in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it with that which is mentioned in its chapter.
Chapter LXXXVI.
If, therefore, wind emerges from the wound, when the sick person gasps from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
If it does not have great depth, and is fresh with its own blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the sick person; but put attractive ointment on it, and loosen it twice a day.
If, however, ointment is not present for you, then put old lint into the wound's opening so that it sucks the moisture emerging from it: and have the sick person sleep on the wound, so that what has gathered in it runs out.
If, however, three days or more have already passed for the wound, and no spasm happens to the sick person, nor bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in the breathing, and you see the rest of his conditions good, then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore, treat him with bandages and other treatment until he is healed.
If, however, his healing is excused, and it is always opening, then know that a fistula has already been formed.
Therefore, treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with the preceding suture, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
If, however, it has already made an impression on the bone, and chipped fragments from it, then investigate the wound, and hasten to remove those fragments, if they are detached.
If, however, they are not detached, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for their extraction will thus be eased.
However, for other accidental wounds in the remaining limbs, the judgment in their treatment is the judgment we have described.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen, and the exit of the intestines, and their expulsion.
Chapter LXXXVII.
Rupture that occurs in the abdomen is great, medium, and small.
From a great one, therefore, sometimes an intestine, or a number of intestines, emerges.
Therefore, their introduction, and their stitching, is more forceful and more difficult.
And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
Therefore it follows that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten their introduction to their place immediately, since it is inflated, opened, and thickened; therefore, their entry becomes difficult.
For this reason, therefore, the middle of the ruptures is better; since with that, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two kinds.
Know that the suturing of the belly is according to four ways.
Two common sutures agree in the suture of the belly, and in the suture of the remaining wounds of the body; and two other sutures properly correspond to the other wounds.
However, they are more proper with the suture of the belly; and I tell you each one with exposition and declaration. Therefore, I say, that when the wound is small, and something emerges from the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it, then that is due to one of two ways.
Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said, or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Therefore, when that is so, then it is necessary to warm it, so that you immerse a sponge, or a damp cloth in lukewarm water alone.
Or boil it in water with squinancy, and cyperus, and spica, and embrocate the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does it, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow, or mallow has been boiled.
For by it the entrance of it is relieved with a small thing.
If, however, its return is excused after this treatment, then make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than the incision: and no coercion is made to cut after necessity and lack of instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let the thin end not be as thin as a spatula, but a little duller: and it is that which resembles a caia, as you see.
Therefore, when the wound is widened, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its own proper place, if possible over it: because it is better.
When, however, the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly, if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
And thus it is necessary that you administer this in large wounds, and in medium-sized wounds.
In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then have a pious attendant present, holding the whole rupture with his hand, and bring together its edges.
Then uncover from it to the one who follows, stitching something after something: and this is the common mode of single stitching.
And it is that you should take a needle, or a number of needles according to the amount of the wound's breadth.
Then leave from the extremity of the rupture a quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician; and insert one needle past that, in which you shall have introduced thread into the two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of the thread being beneath the skin from the interiors, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have thus brought together two extremities of skin, and two extremities of the thread: and there are four strands.
Then tighten with the doubled thread in a circular motion of the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two edges of the wound are brought together with a proper closure.
Then leave the thickness of a finger also, and insert another needle in them; afterwards, thread it with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Therefore do not cease to do that with the needles of which you have need, until you complete the closure of the entire wound.
And let the needles be of a medium thickness between thin and thick; because very thin needles pierce the flesh very quickly, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin; for that reason it is necessary that they be of a medium thickness and fineness.
And it is not necessary for the needle to be inserted too deeply into the two nearby skin edges, so that the flesh is not pierced too quickly and the wound is opened before it has healed, nor should they be pulled too tight with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient during their sleep; and place pads of cloth around them on all sides, which hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound has already healed.
And this type of suture with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Because one, or two, or approximately that number of needles suffices for their suture.
However, the second common suture is to bring together four edges: two skin edges and two edges of the wound itself, at one time, with a needle on which a thread is wound equal in fineness and thickness.
Then, when you have pierced these four edges with the needle, pull the needle back from the side from which you began it, so that the thread retreats from the upper part of the wound; so that the suture will be like the suture of cloth with which cloths are tied, and place between each suture a quantity of thickness less than a finger's width.
However, this suture is known by men.
And with this suture I treated a wound that had befallen a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound's rupture was more than one palm; and about two palms of the middle intestine had protruded from the intestines, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Therefore, I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Therefore, the wound was consolidated in a space of approximately fifteen days; and I cared for him, and he was healed; and he lived after that for many years, carrying on with his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
And it was miraculous that I did not treat it with ointment.
Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor any medicines, were to be found.
Therefore, I placed aged lint upon the wound twice a day, and diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
I shall however relate two specific types of suture according to the account of the text.
And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture: and insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and the muscle running along the length and breadth of the whole body: leave the extremity of the thread on the side in which you inserted the needle, and make the other extremity penetrate from the inner part to the outer on the other extremity mirach.
When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in this same extremity mirach from the outer part to the inner: and leave the extremity sifac, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate the other extremity from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration that you make it penetrate in the sifac extremity mirach, which is on its part, until it penetrates the whole of it.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the extremity, which is from sifac on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin which it has penetrated.
Then reduce it into that skin, and sew the extremity sifac, which is on the other side, with this extremity mirach: and withdraw it from the skin which is on its part, and do that once, and another: and do that alternately, until you have sewn the whole exterior according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is such as the sutures of leatherworkers who sew skins: so that you sew sifac alternately from one side with one extremity of the skin; and that you leave it alternately from the other side, until you complete it.
The second species of proper suture, which Galen said.
His discourse narrates that you sew it according to the manner in which some physicians sew them, so that they gather each part to its corresponding, natural counterpart: and they apply the extremity of sifac to its other extremity, and the extremity of mirach to its other extremity.
And that is done according to what I tell you.
You should place the needle into the extremity of mirach nearest you from the outer side, and cause it to penetrate into the inner part of it alone; and release the two extremities of sifac.
Then turn the needle, and cause it to penetrate from the outer side to the inner in the two extremities of sifac, namely on both sides.
Then turn both of them, also causing them to penetrate from the inner to the outer, into the two other extremities of mirach, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and is a suture whose recollection preceded.
This is therefore the speech of Galen also.
And some said.
The suture of the belly is rectified with two needles.
That is, you should pass a single thread through each of them; and begin with the insertion of the needle, from where it is with you, and have it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew hides equally.
And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than that of other parts of the belly.
The judgment of the treatment of a wound is like the judgment of other wounds.
That is, when you acquire a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and you suture it, and you adapt it, then put over it the powder of incarnating substance.
If the air has already altered the wound, then put on it certain ointments which are present to you, until they cause pus; and the threads fall out, and the wound is healed, and mirach [or similar substance] .
Then treat it as the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
However, if the medicines are not present to you, then immediately put on it, from the time it begins to emit pus, old plaster; and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
If, however, you fear that the wound communicates with the main limbs in the injury, then it is necessary that you soak soft wool in oil of temperate heat, or in rose oil; and place it around the areas which are between the groins and under the armpits.
If, however, he feels pain, or pricks, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens) then enema him with astringent, dark, lukewarm wine; especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine and become a penetrating exit to its cavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing; and that which is from the small one, of more difficult healing.
However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not accept healing from a wound which happens in it at all; and that is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nervous nature.
If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is a zirbum, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, a space has passed it, and it has already become green or black, then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place which has blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
For in a zirbum are veins and arteries.
Then cut that which is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the pull on it may be alleviated upon you, and the extraction of it at the occurrence of a zirbum, and the emission of pus from the wound.
A reminder of the wound that occurs in the Intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some people.  For this reason, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a spear thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old, and it became a fistula, and excrement and gas issued from it.
Therefore, I applied treatment until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it until he was healed, and the area was consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick man that a bad accident might happen to him in his belly, and no bad accident happened to him from that.
And he remained in better condition, eating and drinking, and engaging in sexual activity, and entered the bath, and exercised in his daily activities.
And now some experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is necessary that it be tied in this way.
And it is as if you take ants of large heads.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant of those which have open mouths on the two lips of the wound.
When therefore it bites upon it, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres, and does not come loose.
Then place another ant close to the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Then reduce it, and sew the wound.
For those heads remain attached to the intestine, until the intestine is eaten, and healed, and no harm happens to the sick person at all. And now it is possible that the intestine be tied even with a thin thread: which has been scraped from the intestine of an animal, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
And it is so that you take the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and it is scraped a great deal.
Then tie a thin linen thread wrapped around its extremity.
Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Then reduce it into the rupture. And this method of sewing with ants and the intestine is only according to the path of trust and hope.
Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, then there is no remedy but subtlety, nor is its healing possible at all.
Concerning the treatment of Zuchemen, and Fistulas.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
Know that any wound or abscess, when it grows old and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and constantly discharges pus, and does not close, then it is universally called a fistula, wherever it is on the body, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula, in truth, is a filtered, hard, white knotting, with no pain, having the cavity of a bird's feather; and because of that, some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
And it is, in some cases, moist, which discharges pus.
And perhaps the moisture breaks open in some cases.
And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes little; and sometimes thick, and sometimes thin.
And I already stated in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that any ulcer that does not heal, nor flesh grow in it, is not so except for one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its bad quality; or because between it and the edges of it is a hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh; or because there is much dirt and grime; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter given to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment; or because corruption descending in the region is a type of pestilence, or because of a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where the digestion of illnesses is difficult and the healing of abscesses is delayed by nature; or because there is one opening, or a number of openings, in it.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division; and it is necessary here to make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by the way of surgery with the hand.
Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
For among them are Fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews, or the intestines, or the bladder, or one of the ribs; or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints of the composed limbs, such as the hand and foot; and among them are those that go towards the proximity of the principal member and similar ones.
Therefore, which of these Fistulas is in this manner, is from illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and dealing with it is labor and ignorance.
If, however, there is any Fistula among them whose depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its treatment, and you wish to reach knowledge of it, then take a probe made of air or iron, if the Fistula extends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
If, however, there is tortuosity in the Fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Because lead, with the lightness of its body, is alleviated and bent around the tortuosity.
If the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate upon it with a probe.
Therefore, irrigate one of its openings from among its openings.
For the moisture with which you irrigate it, goes toward the other openings, and runs out of them.
Then inquire carefully in whatever way is possible for you: to know whether there is a bone or nerve, and is the fistula's cavity distant or near; or is it a single fistula with many openings, and stand upon all of it with your greatest strength; with your questioning, whereby you question the sick person, and the discovery of pain at compression with your hand upon the place, and similar signs and causes of incidents of abscesses.
When, therefore, you have stood upon all of that position truly, then proceed to treatment with confidence; and it is, as you consider then, if it is a near fistula appearing, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then cut the fistula according to what has been previously stated in my account, and remove what is in it by filtration, and rotten flesh, that arises within its opening from flesh, or boil, and similar things; and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the fistula is of distant depth, and is straight, then it is necessary to cut it in its depth as much as possible.
Then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh.
Then apply strips wrapped in sharp medicines; and insert them into the cavity of the fistula which you have grasped with the iron; do this with it several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
If, however, it is not healed by that, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
If, therefore, the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is ascertained by you, then seek it out, and cut it out according to what I have told you; if nothing from a vein, or nerve, or main limb, prevents you, as we said.
If, therefore, bone is detected by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Then treat it with that which makes it flesh, until it is healed.
If, however, it is not healed and emits pus as it did, then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore, expose it again, and meticulously perform its scraping and cleansing with your utmost strength.
Then restore it.
If therefore it is healed, it is good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a remote depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore, you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
If the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, pull it out with fine forceps suitable for it.
But if there are many bones, then carefully perform the extraction of them all, and do not leave any of them with your strength.
If, however, any moisture opposes you, and there is no fear or error in cutting them: then cut those moistures and flesh, if there are any there, and free the bones.
If, however, you do not have the preparation to remove the bones from your time, then place something over the wound that will putrefy it: and leave it until that which is around those bones from the flesh and moisture putrefies.
And guard the wound so that it does not consolidate.
And let the incision that you made in your operation be constricted.
Indeed, place over it, if you fear it, a cloth soaked in ground sulfur mixed with oil; or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any green ointments.
For when those humidities, namely, putrefy, and the bones are separated from them, the removal and drawing of them will be eased.
If however there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg, or the hip bone, and similar to them, and that which is corrupt from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost scraping until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Then restore the wound.
If however that which is corrupt within it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it completely to the place where the corruption has reached; then treat it until it is healed. And I relate to you a case, which happened to a man in his leg: that you may set it as an example and aid for your operation.
There was a young man, about thirty years of age, whom pain afflicted in his leg, from a cause which originated within his body, that is, from the interior, until the materials reached the leg, and it became a large abscess: and there was no external cause.
Therefore, time passed with the doctors' error, until the abscess opened, and many materials poured out with it.
And his treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it; all of which emitted pus and bodily humors.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one among them skilled in the art of hands, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials flowing from those openings with great force: even the entire body of the man had now decayed, and his color was yellowish.
Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings, and found them connecting with each other from all parts of the leg. I therefore hastened and cut over one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone; and I found it corrupted; already gnawed and blackened and putrefied, and perforated until it had penetrated to the marrow.
I then sawed what had been exposed to me, and removed the corrupt bone.
And I judged that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption which I cut and sawed away.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed; and this repetition in its operation and section was not necessary, except because of the weakened condition of the sick person, and his/her lack of tolerance, and my fear for him/her concerning death; because fainting fits were occurring in him/her every hour from an excess of evacuation.
Therefore, he/she was healed with complete healing; and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good condition was established in his/her body, and his/her strength returned; and he/she was restored to his/her former condition; and no harmful effect was produced in him/her by walking at all.
If however a projecting bone in a place of the body is already fractured, then it is necessary that you saw it, according to this method: and it is: that you take a ligature, and tighten it on the extremity of the projecting bone; and instruct someone to pull it upwards; and place another ligature of thicker wool over the first ligature. Then bind it over the flesh, which is beneath the bone; and extend its extremity, so that you pull the flesh downwards; and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place a piece of wood, or a plank, beneath the bone properly from below; because when you do this, it is not prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place for a short while, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone; and that corruption does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compels a sawing in another place. If the bone is corrupted, and is not projecting, but rather its part continues with another part, and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in a part of it, then uncover the flesh from all sides entirely.
Then place wood below.
Afterwards, saw it from the first side, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continued from the other side; and let the sawing be along the length from the corruption a little, as we said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues on the other side.
If, however, the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no ingenuity in it except abrasion.
If the corruption is in the ridge of the hand, or in the ridge of the foot: then the matter is very difficult in it.
But you must inquire how the corruption appears to you.
And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever disposition is possible for you, and with whatever ingenuity it is rectified for you: when it does not create opposition for you, vein, or nerve.
And know that there are many knives and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity.
Therefore, it is necessary to prepare an instrument suitable for that operation for every kind of operation.
And know that these operations show you the type of instrument you need, when you have long study with you.
And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a witness to the methods of illnesses: for then you will find for yourself what is suitable for it from instruments for every illness.
Saw shape.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
This saw shape depicted, be done decently. Let its upper arch be sharpness of iron, and its handle be of boxwood, and be made pyramidal, decently.
Shape of the razor's joints.
Let the head of this razor, according to the form of a star-shaped nail's head, and its points be according to the form of the points of an elischetfegi.
And it is not fitting, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it, when they are corrupted, or the bone is large and great.
Shape of the larger razor.
Shape of the middle razor.
Shape of the broad razor.
Shape of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Shape of the other slender razor.
Shape of the other razor with a curved end.
Shape of a small, slender, taut razor.
Shape of the razor with which bones are cut.
Shape also of the large razor.
This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw: it is shown in many places for the reason of cutting bones.
Shape of the razor suitable for the cutting of that which is perforated from the bones.
Its end is triangular, with sharp edges.
It is made of Indian (metal).
And similarly, all that we have said about razors, knives, and saws should be made.
Concerning the incision of the extremities and the sawing of the bones.
Chapter LXXXIX.
The extremities putrefy, either from an external or an internal cause.
Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medical remedies, and the treatment does not help, and you see the corruption affecting the limb, which nothing counteracts, then it is necessary to cut off that limb up to where the corruption is, so that it escapes from death or from the greater evil of the limb's defect.
And the sign that this happens is that the limb darkens until it rots; that fire has burned it, or that it rots after darkening; until that rot is cut away to what follows that limb, and spreads to the whole body.
Therefore, hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain poisonous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, and viper, and adder, and the like.
If therefore the corruption or injury is in the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to spread to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it occurs in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it seizes the forearm.
And if it invades it, then cut the arm at the elbow at its joint. If however the corruption passes, and you see it approximately at the elbow, then in that is the death of the weakling.
And to administer beyond that from the treatment, is the measure of skill.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades the toe, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it seizes the sole of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
If however it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
If however the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for letting go and leaving the sick person to die.
And the method of cutting or sawing the limb is that you should tighten the ligament below the one you wish to cut, and tighten another ligament above the location.
And let the surgeon extend one ligament downwards, and let the surgeon extend the other ligament upwards.
And separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Then it is to be cut or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloths on all sides, and that the saw does not touch the healthy part; and that added injury and a hot abscess befall the sick person.
If however an internal flow of blood occurs during your work, then cauterize the spot quickly, or place some powders that stop the blood upon it.
Then return to your treatment, until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and care for it until it is healed.
And I tell you that it happened to a man in his foot, this same event that I relate to you.
Because it happened in his foot as a blackness, with a burn resembling fire's combustion: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began the whole foot.
Therefore, the man hastened from himself, after seeing the corruption befall the limb with its severity, which he found from its pain and burning: and it affected it at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time had passed, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand. So he came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with what I placed on his hand from medicines after cleansing his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger, until the corruption began in the hand.
Therefore, he called me to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping for a repulsion of that excess from me: and I also feared death for him at the incision of his hand.
Because the man's strength was over the matter.
Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it came to me from him, that, because he hurried, he cut his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I have not brought this account, unless that it be a help concerning that which falls of this kind of illness: and that it be a signification by which it is signified, and according to which it is done.
Concerning the treatment of Sinuses, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Chapter 90.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy limbs, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus; then it bursts, or is perforated, and that which is within it of pus escapes, and a hollow space remains as if it were a vessel; and the skin over it is like a cloth which has already become thin; and it does not reach its final stage of corruption, nor does it impinge on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus; and it is not called a Fistula; however, if its space is prolonged, until the corruption impinges on any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or a zuken.
And its treatment is that you should cut that entire skin as it rolls; and especially when it is thinned and made like a cloth; and you trust that it does not adhere to the place, due to its corruption.
However, if you hope that the skin adheres, and that corruption does not result from that ultimate consequence; and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an enema; and consider it as a sinus.
Then, if it is large, and the pus emitted from it is of foul odor, then enema it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, to be mixed together in a vessel; and boil them over the fire until the medicine turns red; and it comes to the consistency of honey.
Then take from it what you need; and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema the sinus with it; and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
Then extract it with pressure; do this for so many days, until the sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is enematized with ash water, when this medicine is not present for you; and it is that you should take the ashes of vine wood, or ashes from holly wood, and pour water over it.
Then strain it, and enema with it, until you are confident that the sinus is now cleansed.
If the sick person does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash water, then enema it with water and honey, to which some crushed ziniar has already been mixed.
Or enema it with mixed honey and wine, since it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash away; and wine causes the sinus to adhere, especially when there is excess astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you do this repeatedly, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has now been removed, then enema it with that which causes flesh to grow in it.
And it is, that you should take from the plaster dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose oil, and astringent wine; or enema it with certain medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
If the opening of the sinus is narrow, into which the enema tube does not fit, then widen it slightly with iron; or place on it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in Basil ointment, until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is too wide, then draw together its edges with sutures; and leave in it the amount into which the clyster enters without addition.
And similarly, if the opening from which pus runs is elevated upwards, then cut it in the lower place within it, so that pus runs from it downwards; because when pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing in it.
If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus approximately below the place you desire: then try to prepare the limb by a preparation so that pus runs from it easily, according to that which is prepared for you.
Try that nothing of the pus remains in it at all; and take the consolidating medicines that are placed on the sign, suitable to what you desire.
And spread them out on a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such a size as to cover the entire sinus.
Then cut with scissors, directly in the opening of the sinus, a hole larger than the sinus opening slightly.
Then spread some mild ointments onto another cloth, according to the size of the hole; and place it over it, at a distance from the sinus opening, so that the pus may exit from it more easily; and do not remove the large cloth, except after a few days at one time.
However, the one over the sinus opening is the one you remove every hour, so that what collects in it of pus may exit; and so that you may know whether the matter flowing from it, the pus, is much or little, or digested or undigested.
And with this again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether its master feels pain in it, or whether there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or whether there is no abscess in it.
When, therefore, your treatment proceeds thus, and you see the matter that exits through the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or is approaching adherence; then, therefore, release it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you release the wound, then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment. However, if thin matter exits from the sinus after a long period, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act to the contrary of that.
However, if undigested pus exits from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If, therefore, the adhesion of the sinus is delayed, and its matter prolonged, then add to the drying of the remedies, but let the physicians make them, so that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their virtue, like the dyafinicon ointment, when superfluity of addition from zegi is added to it.
And from the latest means by which it is treated, is that you take dyafinicon ointment, and it is dissolved with rose oil, and the old wine is sprinkled over it in equal substance.
Then mix it with that, and use it.
And it now does a similar action to this, when dyafinicon ointment is not present for you, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and you use it.
Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is on the fire.
Then line a cloth over it, and bind it over the sinus: and line with the honey that you boiled until it thickened: and powder spices over it, and place over it a cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes long aristolochia, and roots of the celestial lily, and is lily, and herb flour, and centaury are administered in it.
Use them simple, or aggregated, grind them, and sieve them: and powder them over the honey that I have described, and use it.
If the sinus persists and is not cured by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it: or it is now making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, according to what has been previously stated. On the treatment of whitlow and the worn-out nail, and the addition of the cut finger, and the section.
Chapter XCI.
Whitlow is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of the thumb of the hand, or the foot; and perhaps arises in the other fingers.
Therefore, when its condition is prolonged and its treatment neglected, and it becomes an abscess with a hot abscess; or it is corrupted and emits pus, until it gnaws the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor; and the fingertip becomes broad, and its color becomes dark.
Therefore, when you treat it, according to what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you cut with the iron all the excess which remains of the nail.
Then cauterize the wound after that.
For the cautery is very helpful.
However, if the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the superfluous parts of the nail are now pressing the flesh inwards and beginning to prick it and injure it: then it is necessary to place a fine probe under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it upwards; and cut that flesh easily, and put upon what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until all of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If however, corruption has already penetrated the bone, then it is necessary to cut into that bone and remove it: for it will never heal while corrupt bone remains in it.
If, however, you see corrosion and corruption progressing into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to the aforementioned method.
Then treat it until it heals.
If, however, attrition or impact occurs to a nail, and a severe pain arises in it, then it is necessary to first bleed the infirm person.
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula in a transverse cut from top to bottom.
And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail, for you will cause intense pain to the infirm person by that, and it will be a cause for the generation of additional flesh at the site.
Then treat the place with something that relieves pain.
A supernumerary finger, which is born in some people's hands, is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps some of them have bones, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its origin is in some of the finger's knots.
Therefore, the one born in some of the finger's knots does not move; and the one born near the finger's joint perhaps does move.
Therefore, the incision of the one that is fleshy among them is easy.
That is, to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
However, the treatment of the one whose origin is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Therefore, abstain from its incision.
However, in the one that arises on the finger at the last of the nodules, then you must first cut the flesh of it with a round incision, all the way to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Then treat it until it is healed.
However, the consolidation that occurs between the fingers often happens either by birth, that is, it is born with it, or from a wound's consolidation, or from a fire's burning, and similar things.
Therefore, it is necessary to separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place between them strips of cloth, or bandages steeped in rose oil, so they do not consolidate quickly, and separate between them; or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the place is consolidated as it should be.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation according to what is prepared and suits the limb's shape.
Concerning the incision of a defect.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
Ulcers are veins wrapped, thick, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many members of the body; and their occurrence is most frequent in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and work, and who carry burdens.
Therefore, it is necessary that you administer a shaking of the body from black cholera with a vigorous shaking sometimes.
Then phlebotomize the patient's arm.
However, their treatment with iron is according to two methods.
One of them is that they should be cut, and the black blood drawn out.
And the other method is that the vein should be raised, and the whole of it drawn out.
However, its incision is according to this method.
First, bathe the leg in very hot water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of the thigh, down to the lower part of the knee, with a bandage.
Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then cut the nail downwards, until such a quantity of blood issues forth as you see sufficient, and as the patient's strength can tolerate.
Afterwards tie it up; and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile; and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting, when the veins are full, and that harms the patient.
Its elevation, however, is in this way.
Shave the patient's leg if it has many hairs.
Then immerse him in a bath; or rub his leg with warm water until it turns red and the veins are prominent; or have him exercise vigorously, if a bath is not available, until the limb is warmed.
Then cut the skin in a straight line along the vein: either at its end near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from every side until it is visible: and at its appearance, you will see it turning from red to a blackish hue.
When it emerges from the skin, you will see it white like a string.
Then insert a probe under it, until, when raised, it emerges from the skin; suspend it with a blunt, gentle hook.
Then make another cut near that cut, three fingers away.
Then scrape the skin from above the vein, until it appears.
Then raise it with probes as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then make another cut, or several cuts, if you need them.
Then raise it, and cut it with the last cut at the heel.
Then pull it out to the cut above it.
And do this until you pull it out from the cut that is higher, or from all the higher cuts, until when it emerges entirely: then cut it.
However, if it does not yield to you in being pulled and lifted, then insert a needle with strong thread doubled, and tie it, and pull it out: or insert a rod under it, and rotate your hand in every direction until it comes out.
And beware, lest it be cut.
For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and a harmful injury enters upon it from that.
Therefore, when you have pulled it all out, then place on the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, and care for it until it is healed.
If, however, the vine is contracted, having a twisting that is wrapped around parts, and is not, as we said, straight: then it is necessary to cut along its twisting and its wrapped-around places on every side.
Then suspend it with hooks until you lift it all out; and beware at your cut on it that you do not strike a vein or injure it, for it will become difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Therefore, preserve your caution.
Form of the Incision by which the Vine is healed.
Form of the Blind Hook.
It does not have a curve like the other hooks, nor is its tip sharp so as not to injure a vein; and it is of a thick, gentle bend, because if it were slender, it would cut the vein with its slenderness; indeed, let its thickness be superfluous, as we said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg. Chapter XCIII.
This vein is generated in legs in hot lands, such as Al-Jazira and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, few in tenderness, that is, in which no grass or tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as occurs within the bodies of snakes and roundworms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And a sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg.
Then the place becomes blistered.
Then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
When therefore its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary that you wrap a piece of lead over it, whose weight is from one drachma keil up to two drachmas, and tie it; and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever therefore anything emerges from it to the exterior, wrap it in lead, and tie it.
If it extends a great deal, then cut off a portion of it, and wrap the remainder.
And do not cut it at the root before the whole of it emerges.
Because if you cut it, it will contract, and enter the flesh; and it causes an abscess, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be gently drawn out, gradually, until it emerges from its final part, and nothing of it remains in the body; and from this vein indeed emerges in some men what is in its length five palms and ten.
And it has already come to me, that it emerged from a man with twenty palms.
If, however, it is cut by you at the time of your treatment: then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it through a long hole, with the instrument, until the whole of whatever is in it of matter is evacuated; and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicaments for several days. Then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and many openings occur in it, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Therefore treat it, as we said in the division, and with what has been previously stated.
Concerning the incision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called the disease of cattle.
Chapter XCIV.
This disease is called in a certain land among us the disease of cattle, because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending, and its movement from limb to limb is apparent to the senses, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Just as worms and snakes, that is, intestinal worms and threadworms, occur in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice.
Because when it moves through the body, and rises to the head, and reaches a place, then perhaps it bursts there, and emerges, and destroys the eye, and that happens many times.
Therefore, when one wishes to cure it, and to extract it, then that is not done except at its movement and the appearance of it to the senses.
Therefore, it is necessary to bind that which is above it, and that which is below it with a strong ligature.
Then cut above it, and extract it.
If it penetrates into the flesh, and you do not find it, then place a cautery on the place with fire until it dies.
And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said. If however you see it having already reached the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good ligature.
Then cut above it, and extract it.
And it is necessary that the sick person use purification of his body, with medicines that dissolve evil, putrid humors.
And let him beware of foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the section upon the disease Nakir.
Chapter XCV.
This disease is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then changes from limb to limb.
And I myself have already seen it, as I tell you.
I was called to a sick woman in certain villas.
And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
And after I remained for an hour, I saw one swelling move with a wriggling motion, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than possible, so as to be like quicksilver as it runs from place to place.
Therefore, the pain receded from that place, and settled in the shoulder.
Then I sat for an hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it moved about in her whole body, just as I had seen.
I was therefore astonished at the speed of its change from limb to limb.
And indeed, I had not previously seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner.
However, I have seen many who find pain shifting from limb to limb; and I have not seen it myself in this way, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think it is anything but that, because the woman was of those whose bodies, having dry veins, are thus shown to have that airiness shifting.
And it is necessary that they not appear in that way in those who are delicate, and whose bodies are moist, and have hidden veins.
Therefore, if you wish to treat it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to you with your eyes, as we said, then tie above it and below it quickly; and cut above it, until that confined airiness escapes; and cauterize the place.
If, however, you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with shaking the body, and with things that expel air, and relieve them with foul pills, and pills of serapion, and similar ones.
On the extraction of Arrows.
Chapter XCVI. Arrows are diversified according to their types and according to the places in which they fall from the body.
Their diversity is, indeed, because some of them have large points, and small ones: and concave, and blunt.
And some of them have three angles.
And some of them have tongues.
And some of them have stars.
Those that are according to the members on which they fall, are according to two ways.
For either the members are from principal concave members, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lungs, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and those similar to them.
Therefore, when it falls into any of these members, and signs of death appear to you, which I relate to you afterwards, then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows it in him in whom it is, in many dispositions.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and exits through the membrane that is on top of the brain, are: that violent headaches, and scotomas, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasms, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of cholera occur.
And perhaps blood exits from the nostrils, or the ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And a white moisture like gruel exits from the wound.
And something like the watery part of flesh exits from it.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not exit.
The signs of an arrow striking the heart are: that it is close to the left nipple; and that one feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not a hollow thing.
And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the movement of a pulse; and black blood flows from the wound.
And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Therefore know that death descends without doubt.
And the sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the outflow of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels that follow the neck become ulcerated, and the sick person's colour changes.
And he exhales a great, deep breath: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
If an arrow strikes the covering that is in the chest, then it is near the small ribs: and there is a great gasp with violent pain, with a sigh: and all the shoulder limbs are moved.
And if an arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps undigested food will come out of the wound.
And if an arrow strikes the belly, and is fixed in it: something of the excrement, or a zirb, or a ruptured intestine, will issue from the wound.
Therefore, there is no hope for its cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
If an arrow strikes the bladder, and urine issues forth; and something proceeds from it outward, and the pain is greater than the weakness, then know that it is mortal.
However, other limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder-blade, and armpit, and the vertebrae of the back, and the collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar limbs are saved according to many dispositions, when the arrow does not find an artery, or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned.
And I tell you what I have seen concerning these arrows, so that you may understand through it about your treatment.
Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid. And the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained only a small tip of it, with which it adheres to its shaft. And it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, on which there are no ears.
Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no evil accident occurred in his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is of the kind that has ears.
Therefore, I cut above it between the two [gullets] and it was already submerged in his throat.
Therefore, I worked on it carefully until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly, and we thought that he would die from it.
Therefore, after thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut above the arrow; and I worked on it, and extracted it; and he was healed, and no harm befell him.
And I saw a man in whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound above it had consolidated.
Therefore, after seven years, an arrow came out at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whose belly an arrow had fallen, and the wound above it had consolidated, and the arrow remained within her; and no change occurred in her condition, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, in whose face an arrow had fallen; and the wound had consolidated, and it remained, causing him not much pain; and many such cases like these.
And I extracted an arrow from the king's chief men, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already inclined slightly to the right side; and the entire arrow was hidden.
Therefore, I was called to treat him after the arrow's impact for up to three days.
Therefore, I found the arrow wound to be very tight.
Therefore, I searched for it with a fine probe, and I did not feel it; and he indeed found a prick and pain beneath his right ear.
Therefore, I hoped that this prick was from the arrow's tip.
Therefore, I plastered the area with a plaster that had attracting and digesting properties, trusting that the area would become an abscess, and that I would see a sign of the arrow so that I could cut over it; and there was no event in the area signifying that the arrow had reached the place.
Therefore, I applied the plaster to him for many days, and no event occurred, and the wound healed meanwhile; and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
And he told me that.
Therefore, I applied sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened; and when I probed it, I felt a thin arrowhead stuck in the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the arrowhead became visibly apparent; and I spent approximately four months with him during that time.
Then, after the wound had enlarged, and I was able to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not yield to extraction, I did not cease to refine and devise ingenious methods upon it, until one day I began to use properly crafted forceps, according to the form they will take at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Therefore, I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the sick man was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
And I tell you the nature of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may set it as a rule and understanding of that which I have not said.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not understood with the narrative, nor does the book encompass it, and a skilled craftsman compares little things to much: and what is present to what is absent: and finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descents of foreign things of this art when they occur.
Therefore, I say that arrows do not emerge from the members in which they are fixed, except in two ways. Or by traction from the place from which it entered.
Or by the contrary of another part.
And that which emerges from where it entered, either is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and is drawn, and emerges.
If it does not yield to exit at the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary to leave it for some days, until the flesh that is around it rots: and its traction is eased, and its egress.
And similarly if it is fixed in the bone, and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for some days: and again with traction and movement every day, until it emerges.
If it does not yield to you for exit after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until the arrow's openings are enlarged.
Then pull it, and extract it.
However, if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already advanced into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those accidents which I mentioned appear from the sick person, then abstain from pulling the arrow, and leave it, until its condition is equalized after some days.
For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate to the sifach; and the sick person remains for some days, and nothing of those accidents happens to him; then proceed in the extraction of the arrow.
However, if it is fixed firmly, and does not yield to your extraction: then apply a drill around the arrow, as I have told you; then treat the wound until it is healed.
If however the arrow is now hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sight, then seek it with probes.
If however you feel it, then extract it with certain instruments appropriate for its extraction.
If, however, you cannot reach it because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the arrow's length deep within; and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there; then cut around it until the wound is enlarged and it is possible to extract the arrow.
If, however, there are ears [or openings] by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them on all sides, by all the means you can; and if the flesh cannot be released from the broken or twisted ears, until it escapes.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps, to all sides, until you cause it to escape; and with the utmost subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
If you cannot reach it within one hour, then leave it for several days, until what is around it rots.
Then try again; for then it will be easier.  But if a flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we said concerning its treatment in its chapter: and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And use every means possible to extract the arrow; and let it be with ease and tranquility, or with slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary, when you pull out the arrow, to make it weak according to the shape in which the arrow was at the time of the wound.
Because it is more helpful.
If, however, it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible to you from the figures.
However, if an arrow emerges from the opposite side, either something is already protruding from it outwards; or the tip of the arrow forms a bump, visible as a protuberance on the skin above, and you see it protruding: therefore, cut over it, and the incision should be large enough for forceps to grasp it.
Then pull it out; for it becomes easy to remove.
If, however, it remains in the bone, then turn your hand around in a circle until the arrow presses against the bone, and widens its way out; then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for a few days; then try again until it emerges.
If the arrow's wood is inside, then push it out with it.
If, however, the wood has broken, and you wish to administer a push, then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then push it out with it.
If however the arrow is concave, then push it with an instrument entering it.
For the arrow is relieved by it.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cauterize all the flesh where the poison is, if it is possible for you.
Then treat it with what is suitable for it.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and is close to that which you touch with probes, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein, or a nerve, and remove it.
Then sew the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the ends be similar to the beak of a bird, made of iron; when they grasp the arrow, they do not let go of it.
And many kinds of them are made, large, and small, and medium, according to the quantity of the arrow's size, and its smallness, and the breadth of the wound, and its constriction.
The shape of the pushing instrument is concave.
And the shape of the blunt instrument.
This is a blunt extremity, like a spoke, so that its entrance into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be propelled with it.
The extremity of this pushing instrument, which is concave, is concave like a bird's feather, so that the arrow's entrance into it and its propulsion may be eased.
Concerning the bleeding of veins.
Chapter XCVII. The veins to be bled, whose use runs throughout the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which appear on the two temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called the Lookers; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the tip of the nose.
And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins that are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins that are called Algecherich.
And two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins, however, that are lanced in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the wild side; and the common people call it the head vein.
And the Fusca.
And the Middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic; and the common people call it the body vein.
And the Basilic, and it is situated on the domestic side; and it is also called the Tickler.
And the common people call it the belly vein.
And the Arm Cord, and it is situated above the fold; and it is in this that phlebotomy is performed, and it is the one that appears above the thumb with clear appearance.
And the Salvatella: and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger; and it has two branches.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins.
One of them is that which is beneath the curve of the big toe on the outer side.
And the second is the Saphena; and its location is at the heel on the inner side.
And the vein Nesse; and its location is at the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomies of the two veins behind the ears are beneficial for old catarrhs, and hemicrania, and sahafati, and old, bad head ulcers.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is according to what I describe.
And it is, that the patient's head be shaved, and his occiput be rubbed in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth by good friction.
Then let the sick person tighten his neck with a strip, until the two veins appear.
And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, mark it with ink there.
Then take the phlebotomous knife, and it is the one called the incisor.
Then insert it under the vein in the skin, until the phlebotomous reaches the opening.
Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein with the skin with an incident incision.
And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or approximately that: and cause as much blood to flow out as you wish.
Then tie it with bandages, and leave it until it heals.
And already in the beginning of the book was the incision of those and their cauterization.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the two arteries in the temples.
The phlebotomy of the two arteries that are in the two temples is of benefit for old hemiplegia, and crookedness of the neck, and persistent ophthalmia, and a discharge of excessive acute fluids to the eyes. And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I tell you.
Let the infirm person greatly extend their neck, until two veins become manifestly visible to the senses; and let their pulse be demonstrated beneath your finger.
Then mark the locations with ink.
Then lift the skin above the vein upward with your index finger, and insert the incision-making lancet underneath, and lift the vein upward.
And cut it, as you did in the other two veins; and make the blood flow according to your need. Then release the patient's constriction, and place your finger upon the vein for one hour.
Afterwards, place a bandage and pillows upon it, and bind it tightly above the constriction; and release it until it is healed.
And already has preceded the recollection of them, and their incision, and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
Concerning the venesection of the frontal vein after venesection of the cephalic vein.
The benefit of venesection of the frontal vein, after venesection of the cephalic vein, is for the ancient illnesses of the face; and for migraine, and redness; and foul ulcers.
And its quality of venesection is, as I tell you.
The infirm man tightens his neck with a strip, until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument that is called Fossorium.
Whose this is the form.
Place the prominent point that is on the head of the Fossorium above the vein itself, and strike upon it with a comb, or with something else in its manner; and let the blood run according to the quantity that you wish.
Then loosen the wound of the infirm person, and bind it, until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotome.
However, it should not be a phlebotome with a sharp end, like the other phlebotomes, but rather one with a broad end.
And make the incision with the phlebotome across [the vein], because the bone is close [to the vein], and perhaps the phlebotome will break there when it is thin.
Of the phlebotomy of the veins in the two tear ducts.
The benefit of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, is for the eye from scabies and redness, and for a scab in the eye, and for ailments of the face.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of them is such that the weak man binds his neck with a strip.
Then phlebotomize them, and you be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made transverse to the length a little, with a small phlebotome, somewhat broad, for there is no flesh in the place.
For if the phlebotome is of a slender extremity, perhaps it breaks.
Then make the blood run as much as is necessary for you.
And place a compress over them, and bind them for one night, and unbind them.
Concerning phlebotomy of the veins of the Nose.
Phlebotomy of the veins of the Nose is beneficial for acute fevers, and violent headaches, and diseases of the face, such as hemicrania and redness that occurs in the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the infirm person binds his own neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a fine, long lancet, and fix it in the middle of his nostril, between that which divides the nose in a straight line.
Since the vein is not apparent to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And you ought to hold your hand with the lancet for a short time, and make the blood run according to your need.
Then tie it with a single bandage.
For it will quickly recover.
On the phlebotomy of the Guidegi veins.
Indeed, the benefit of the two Guidegi phlebotomies is for the constriction of breathing, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that corrode, that is, erysipelas.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is that the weak person should hold them under both of his neck with a bandage: and the artisan should stand above the head of the sick person, and the sick person should be seated on a seat.
Then the phlebotomist should lance the vein to the length of a wide phlebotomy for a short while.
Then draw out a temperate quantity of blood, or according to what you see as necessary for it.
Then do likewise with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the bandage, and bind the two veins with a middle constriction, so that the sick person is not choked.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound is healed.
On the phlebotomy of the veins, by Algeberich.
The veins, according to Algeberich, are helpful in phlebotomy, because they contribute to the cure of ulcers in the mouth, and the corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, and the fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those in the nose, and around it.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is that you should make the sick person sit before you, and bind their neck with a cloth.
Then roll back his lip, and look at the two veins: one is on the right side of the lip, and the second on its left side, and the demonstration of each is by the blackness of both.
And that is true, because around them are small, black veins.
Therefore, cut each with a suitable incision. If, however, there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then aim for the incision of the larger and more evident of them.
And similarly do with the two veins that are in the upper lip; and, indeed, custom largely runs with it, and cut the two veins that are in the lower lip.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
However, the benefit of the phlebotomy of the two veins that are under the tongue is that the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for suffocations that are in the throat, and illness of the uvula, and illnesses of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the weak person should sit between your hands in the presence of the sun; and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein; and the colour of each should decline to blackness.
Therefore, phlebotomize each one; and beware lest you extend your hand too far in phlebotomizing them.
For beneath them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will occur from those arteries.
Concerning three veins in the elbow.
The three veins, however, which are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those in whose phlebotomy the custom has run in all men.
And their phlebotomy is performed according to two methods.
Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome: or by making an olive-shaped incision, or by cutting with a knife-like phlebotome, and it is Alnesil.
And this is its form.
Thus Alnesil is, that which is suitable for incision.
And from them are broad and narrow types, according to the width and constriction of the veins. The form of a myrtle phlebotome should be broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of lesser width, and of more slender edges.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellow blood.
Concerning phlebotomy of the Basilic vein.
The Basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is an aid to phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from illnesses located beneath the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest, and the belly; and it befits the phlebotomist, when performing phlebotomy on it, to be cautious and to be aware of the risk from it, for an artery is beneath it.
If, therefore, he errs and adds to the phlebotomy puncture, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will occur.
Therefore, it is necessary not to puncture it with the phlebotomy instrument; rather, let it be cut with a lancet.
If the Basilic vein is not clearly visible, then it is necessary to seek another, and to switch to another, or to look for one of its branches; or to perform phlebotomy on the brachial vein in its place.
For it is indeed clear, and cut it with the phlebotomy lancet, as we said.
If, however, you wish to perform phlebotomy on it, the same one, then it is necessary beforehand to constrict the arm, so that you feel the pulse in that place.
Then mark the spot with ink, and afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the phlebotomy lancet, as we said.
And be careful that the blow does not fall through the space from the artery's location.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, swelling in the spot you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
If you see blood at the phlebotomy leap, like the urine of a child, and it is thin, red blood: then know that it is from the artery's blood.
Then quickly place your finger over it for a long space, then remove your finger.
If therefore blood is severed (for it is often severed), then tighten the arm and release it: and let the patient be cautious of its movement: and let it be upon his fear.
And do not move it for several days, until it is healed.
If however the blood is not severed, and it overcomes you, and there is no medicine present to you at your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
For its extremities are contracted, and the blood is severed.
Or take the bark of the fig tree, and split it: take one half, and bind it over the place of the vein's proper constriction, with a bandage and plasters until another day.
Then if the blood is severed, it is good.
And if not, then treat it with that whose previous mention removed the flow of blood from the place of the powders: and the severance of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
Of the phlebotomy of the vein Fusca.
The phlebotomy of the vein Fusca is helpful, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilic vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we said.
And it befits the phlebotomist that he be cautious in his phlebotomy of it, for there is a nerve beneath it.
If therefore the phlebotomist adds in the puncture, and finds a nerve, there occurs numbness in it, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not completely healed.
And this nerve often appears to the sense.
However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle and not shown, then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy where you are going to phlebotomize it, the incision with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
Of the Cephalic vein.
Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to illnesses of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, to phlebotomize it by puncturing with an olive-wood phlebotome or a myrtle-wood phlebotome, because it is the safest of all veins, since there is no artery or nerve below it. However, it is fitting for you in phlebotomy to avoid striking the head of the biceps muscle with the phlebotome, and to seek a gentler location.  And it does not harm it if it is not found with the first strike, so that it may be repeated upon it with phlebotomy several times. However, perhaps it may become suppurative in some people when it is not phlebotomized on the first strike, but that suppuration does not harm it in any way.
On the usefulness of Phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
The quality of Phlebotomy, and its resulting accidents, are matters you must consider.
First, it is necessary for you to know that phlebotomy is not performed except in the preservation of health, and the persistence thereof, and caution against the approach of illnesses.
And that phlebotomy be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely, the Cephalic, and the Fusca, and the Basilic.
And that phlebotomy be performed at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in the Spring, and Summer; and in Autumn and Winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And let phlebotomy be performed on the first, or third day, after three hours have passed of the day.
However, phlebotomy performed in illnesses does not have a fixed time: but when the appropriateness and necessity for it arises, at night, or day, and at any hour, and at any time.
And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Nor should the elderly be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels beforehand with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained stool in them, so that the veins do not draw putrid harmful superfluities from the bowels during phlebotomy, harming the principal members.
Nor should a patient suffering from nausea, or one who is drunk or recovering from drunkenness, be bled until that is removed from them.
Nor a sick person with dropsy.
And let phlebotomy be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, multiple sexual encounters, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything that dissolves bodily or animal strength.
Then consider, in the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with foods, drinks, and medicines; if it is possible for him to take it.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him; or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood may be refined.
And place his phlebotomy on his chest, around the third day, as we said: and try that his chest be emptied that day of all bad animal accidents: such as anxiety, anger, and fear; and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, pain, superfluity of intercourse, and the like.
And let him have present in his seat things with which the custom of men has run by use from aromatics, and scents, and dancing, and the like of them, to the extent possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion, which is higher than the phlebotomist's cushion; afterwards let him draw out his arm, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice, or thrice.
Then tie the ligature with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, because when the constriction is unequal, or by superfluity in the constriction, then it hinders the flow of blood; or in its relaxation, then it also hinders the flow of blood.
Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the phlebotomized person rub his hands together until the veins swell and are made manifest to the senses.
Then the phlebotomist should wipe the phlebotomized area with a little old oil, properly.
Then he should place his left index finger on the vein itself, slightly below the place where he wants to make the phlebotomy, so that the vein does not flee and the incision is broken.
Because some veins are like a fleeing cord during phlebotomy; and some are full of airiness; and when you place the phlebotom on them, they contract beneath the phlebotom, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the phlebotom does not open the vein; and if he does open it, it is constricted. Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and careful in all these matters.
Then he should remove the phlebotom.
And if not, then again do it another time slightly below that place, or above it with haste, if the place is not inflamed.
If, however, it becomes inflamed, or the patient feels pain, then leave him alone for a day or two; and do not tighten the bandage.
For perhaps it will draw the heat of the inflammation.
Nor let him enter the bath.
Then let him repeat the bloodletting, if he desires.
If the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly, and you fear that not enough of the desired quantity will be released from the blood: then repeat the bloodletting in the same opening along the same path, and add a little in the procedure.
And do it quickly, before the area becomes inflamed, for an inflamed area is common in many people after a minor procedure.
If, therefore, you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure upon it at all, for it will not bring any benefit to you. And place something from the dregs of oil upon it, for it eases the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly, administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies, where phlebotomy constricts the flow of blood: and the Tyriaca alfarach and Sagzenea do this when placed upon the area from one of them.
For blood is refined and resolved when it is thick.
If a large abscess occurs at the site of phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to one who is not phlebotomized except on that occasion, or if the vein opening is small, then hurry and place a sponge soaked in warm water and salt upon the area, and bind it for one hour, for it will resolve.
And it is necessary to do this after the blood has exited the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
And indeed, abscesses and swellings often occur at phlebotomy in the Basilica.
Therefore, place your hand upon it; then, if you find softness upon compression with your hand, that swelling is bad.
Therefore, be careful to place something upon it from what we have said.
For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster on it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place is hardened.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of his strength.
And what appears from the colour prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it exit, until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the vein's phlebotomy be enlarged and the phlebotomist be wide; and in one who is weak, let it be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary that he extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow; and better that is administered in the vein's phlebotomy, that it be a transverse incision, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from a flow of blood, and from the incision of a nerve; and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
And to whom it is usual to arrive at syncope during phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy some bread soaked in pomegranate juice water; or chopped dates, if heated; and draw from his blood in three or four stages.
And if he is of a cold disposition, then let him take bread soaked in a myrrh syrup, or in a honey syrup spiced with spices, or in a fragrant spiced syrup.
If syncope occurs during phlebotomy, and its cause is the excessive outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he drink water of meat, and a delicate fragrant syrup; and that he use aromatics with aloes and liniment his chest with it; and that he use the other things which we mentioned in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
However, whoever wants to evacuate their arm and release their blood a second time, it is necessary for someone whose phlebotomy is due to a large evacuation and whose strength is weak, to release the blood gradually in proportion to their strength over consecutive days.
However, whoever wants to evacuate their arm and release their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then let them do it after seven or nine hours from their first phlebotomy.
However, whoever wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite part to which it inclines, it is necessary that their arm be evacuated on the second or third day.
In whose body, however, there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary that blood departs from it in one instance, and a large quantity is drawn from it; and the opening is enlarged until syncope occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand upon his pulse at the flow of blood, so that death does not occur instead of syncope.
For often that happens, when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and negligence occurs.
And it is not necessary, when you wish to release the arm and release blood a second time, when the vein opening is already closed and the exit of blood is difficult, that you press on it with violence and quickly bend or extend it.
For that is very bad, indeed, leave it until it is phlebotomized a second time.
Or remove with sharpness the clotted blood from the vein's opening, and place upon it some salt dissolved in water.
And place upon it something of al-tyriaca alfaroch, or sagzenea, and apply it with gentle pressure until the blood emerges.
If, however, the vein is already suppurated, then leave it and do not touch it until the suppuration is settled.
If necessity provokes you to release the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it above that place, or in another arm in another vein.
Moreover, the arm's vein is to be phlebotomized in the place of the Fusca and Basilica veins, if they are not found, and are hidden, since it is composed from them.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the patient should put his hand into warm water until the skin reddens, and the vein appears clearly.
Then it is to be bound above it with a ligature of moderate constriction.
Then phlebotomize across it gradually, not laterally nor lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be just above the joint of the hand for a little while.
And indeed, the course of blood is placed most in warm water in the time of winter.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, since there is no pulse vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy of the Saluatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that you should grasp the mahason of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you immerse it in warm water until the vein swells and is clearly visible to the senses.
Then the phlebotomist cuts across it.
And if you cut it completely, that will not harm it in any way.
And take care not to injure your hand with the lancet.
For under it are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood coagulates in the opening of the vein, and is prevented from flowing.
When therefore you have extracted the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not solidify quickly.
And similarly it is necessary that you do this with every constricted branch.
The benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand, however, is: because it is beneficial for illnesses of the spleen; and similarly do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
The benefit of saphenous phlebotomy is for illnesses in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should immerse their foot in warm water and make friction upon it until the veins swell, and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap.
And indeed the vein's location is at the heel, appearing towards the big toe, and from it branches out many branches on the foot's face.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or at the heel in its confluence, because it is better and safer.
If you phlebotomize it on the foot's face, then beware of the nerves that are under it on the foot's surface.
And place your phlebotomy instrument so that you phlebotomize it transversely, as if you wish to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be skillful.
If, however, the blood's exit is hindered, then repeatedly immerse his foot in warm water, and let the blood run into it, until it is evacuated.
If the phlebotomist errs in the first instance, then he should repeat with the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe and you need not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The Sciatic vein's location, as we said, is near the heel on the wild side.
And the help of phlebotomy is for the pain of the knee when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the weak person should enter a bath, and hurry: and bind his leg from the side of the knee up to above the heel by four fingers, with a long thin bandage; for it is not apparent except because of that.
When therefore it appears, then the phlebotomist should cut it according to whatever skill is possible to you, or by crossing; and it is better to either make an incision in it, or to cut it away with a section.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
If, however, you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all: then the phlebotomist should cut any branch of it, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ankle; and beware of the nerves, and make the blood run out in the amount you desire.
Then loosen the constriction, and place leather over the phlebotomy site, and bind the place.
For it quickly heals.
Concerning Cupping, and the nature of its use.
Chapter XCVIII.
Cupping instruments are made of horns, and of air, and of glass.
And cupping indeed is done according to two methods.
One with scarification and blood extraction; and the other is cupping without scarification. And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
For it is either with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And cupping treatments administered with scarification and blood extraction are fourteen locations on the body.
Of which one is the cupping of Alnocrati, and is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, and is in the middle of the neck; and the cuppings Alhagdahim, and are two layers on the neck, at both sides together; and the cuppings of the chin, and is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth; and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades; and the cuppings Alachosos at the end of the tail; and the cuppings of the two armpits, and are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of the two thighs; and the cuppings of the two calves.
And cupping indeed does not draw blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore no virtue is lost from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Nor should cupping, whether with fire or without fire, be administered in any illness arising from repletion until the whole body has been evacuated.
If necessity prompts cupping due to illness or custom, we administer it at any hour, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
This is because there are people who, when blood multiplies in them until they require its extraction by cupping, find heaviness and throbbing in their head.
And some of them find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
And some of them find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And some of them scratch the site of their cupping. And some of them have an increase in laughter.
And some of them find the taste of blood in their mouth: or the tongue becomes an abscess, and they spit out blood.
And some of them have an increase in sleep.
And some of them see in their sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to those. Therefore, when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order the application of cupping, after two or three hours have passed of the day. The benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is: because it contributes to heaviness in the head, and what flows to the eyes.
