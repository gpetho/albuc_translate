Sometimes a rupture comes in the groin, as we have said, and the place opens; and no intestines descend to the testicles, and if any descend, it is little, and they return all the time;
And yet if it stays too long in this condition, the wound or membrane grows, so much that the intestines descend;
And this happens from the stretching of the membrane that is in the groin, as we have said, because it is stretched, then the place is softened and swollen and opens;
And the treatment is by cautery, as we have said before; and sometimes it is treated by knife in this manner:
And it is that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the place of the swollen rupture in width according to the size of three fingers;
And then extract the membrane that is under the skin that follows, then take the rod and put it on the apparent place of the membrane;
And press it to the depth of the belly, then sew the two apparent places of the membrane on the head of the rod, and sew one and the other;
Then extract the head of the rod, and do not cut the membrane or stretch the testicle or anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of the intestinal rupture;
Then treat it by the treatment of wounds. And when you cut the threads, cleanse it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The membrane is constrained and does not appear in the rupture, and the cautery is better in this place and closer to healing.
