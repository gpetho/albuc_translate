Often, a disease called "clau" (callus) appears on the lower parts of the foot, causing thick, painful skin that injures the foot; cautery for these can be done in two ways: with fire or with hot water.	This disease, which is something hard paining the foot, very often occurs in the soles of the feet. The cauterization in this case is twofold, actual or caustic.	0.62112254
Fire cautery involves heating a concave cautery tool resembling a vulture's claw, made of iron, matching the size of the callus, with thin edges.	The actual cautery is to heat a hollow cautery like a vulture's quill, made of iron, narrow of edge, of such a size as to surround the corn all round.	0.7208817
Then place the heated tool on the callus and move it around the callus until the cautery penetrates the callus completely. Leave it for three days until it starts to throw off the callus. Then plaster it with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on overnight, as it will eradicate the callus from its roots.	Then put it, hot, on the corn and rotate it till the cautery reaches the root of the corn; and let be for three days to draw the pus; then apply a plaster of wild mallows ground up with salt, and leave the plaster on one night; then it may be drawn out with its root.	0.8299119
Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.	Then treat the site of the wound with stimulating salve till it heals.	0.8507774
If this doesn't work, and this often happens on the skin surface, especially on the hands and feet, then you need to apply hot water cautery. Take a cannula made of brass, iron, or a vulture's feather, and place it on the callus; pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, compressing it fully with your hand, and pressing the cannula's edge into the callus root. The hot water will find its way to the root. The patient should endure the hot water's bite for an hour, then remove it, as the callus with its roots will be eradicated.	If the corns are not inverted, which usually happens on the surface of the body and particularly on the hands and feet, you should take a cannula made of bronze or iron or made of a vulture's quill, and place it on the corn or wart; then pour into the cannula a small quantity of caustic solution; keep your hand on it and rotate it, keeping up a slight pressure so that the edge of the cannula impresses a mark at the root of the corn and the caustic makes its way to the root of the corn. Let the patient endure the action of the caustic for a while, then remove it; for the corn may be drawn out with its root.	0.86690474
Then treat them with ointments that generate flesh once the callus roots are eradicated.	Then treat the site of them, after eradication, with stimulating ointments.	0.68351936
