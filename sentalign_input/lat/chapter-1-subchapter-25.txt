On the method of cauterizing in the shoulder joint, in dislocation of the shoulder.
Chapter 27.
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to humors and does not settle back in place upon its return from dislocation, until it becomes a habit of dislocation, and then it dislocates with slight movement, as we have witnessed before, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation first.
Then lay the patient on his back, or on his healthy side.
Then lift the skin on the inner shoulder upward with the fingers of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inward.
Then heat a cautery iron with two prongs.
In this shape.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates through to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will appear with four cauteries.
Sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery iron having three prongs, and thus the figure of the cauterization will have six cauterizations; the prongs are as thin as a stretched thread.
And this is the shape of the cautery iron with three prongs.
Sometimes one more is added to this method, so that there are eight cauteries.
Then apply crushed leeks with salt over the cauterized area.
Then keep the patient in stillness, so the limb does not move for a while, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is upward, which rarely happens, then cauterize the shoulder with a nail-shaped cautery or with many puncturing cauteries.
For the joint is strengthened, the humor is removed, and the patient is healed.
