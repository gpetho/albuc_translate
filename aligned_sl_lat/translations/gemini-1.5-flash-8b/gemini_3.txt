After I have completed for you, O Children, this book, which is the final knowledge in medicine with its completion, and have reached its end in its explanations and its declarations, it seemed good to me to complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, of surgery with the hand.
Since the operation with the hand has been neglected in our region and in our time, entirely private: until perhaps its knowledge perished, and its trace was cut off: and nothing remained of it except for small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which changed hands: and error and hesitation befell them, until its intentions were closed, and its power was distanced: It seemed good to me to revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise on it according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation: and to come with forms of the cautery instruments, and the other instruments of the work: with the addition of declaration and the hastening of what is necessary.
However, the reason why a good artisan of it with his hand is not found in our time is this: because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be exercised beforehand in the knowledge of anatomy, as Galen has recounted, until he knows the aids of the limbs, and their forms, and their conjunction and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their exits, and the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their exits.
And because of that Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with a work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We, however, have already spoken of that in the introduction of this book.
Since whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said concerning anatomy is not purged, but inevitably falls into error, by which people are killed: just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this knowledge, and boast about it without knowledge and without experience.
That is because I saw a foolish physician cut an abscess on the neck of a woman, and he cut some arteries in her neck, wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a man who was advanced in years, and the stone was large.
Therefore, he reached it and extracted it with a fragment of the bladder.
Therefore the man died on the third day.
And indeed I had already been called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the disposition of the sick man that he would die.
And I saw another physician who was receiving payment from a certain Duke of our land for his medical services; and it happened that a black eunuch who was with him suffered a fracture in his leg near the heel; and the physician, in his ignorance, bound the fracture over the wound with pillows and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound any breathing space.
Then he discharged him according to his desires.
After that, he dismissed him for a few days, and instructed him not to loosen the bandages.  And he stood like that until his leg and foot became ulcerated and festered and reached ruin.
I was therefore called to him, and I hurried to loosen the bandages; and tranquility followed, and he escaped his pains.
However, the corruption had already taken hold in the limb, and I could not restrain it.
Therefore, the corruption ceased to spread in the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who pierced the cancerous abscess; and it ulcerated after days, until its malice increased with its owner.
This is because when the cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then one should not attempt to reach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate its complete excision.
Therefore, children, it is necessary for you to know that surgical intervention is divided into two divisions: namely, intervention associated with health; and intervention with peril in many dispositions. And I have already aroused in every place of this book, in which intervention is found, in which there is terror and fear.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to beware of it, and to cut it away, lest fools find a way to speak ill of it.
Therefore, receive the measure with care and protection, and your sick with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading through God's grace to health and praiseworthy success; and leave the terrible illnesses of difficult cure; and lift your souls from that which causes you fear, lest hesitation enter upon your faith and your well-being. For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your merits.
For Galen already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad physician.

Part I.
Concerning the benefit and harm of the cautery; and with what complexions it is suitable, and at what time; and if with iron, or gold.
Chapter 1.
But before I recount the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its benefits and harms, and in what complexion it is to be employed.
I say therefore, that discourse on the quality of the cautery's benefit and harm is a lengthy and subtle discourse, a matter of knowledge and hidden secret.
Many wise men have also spoken on this, and disagreed on it; and for my part, a little from their sayings suffices me, fearing prolixity.
I say therefore, that the cautery benefits every complexion, whether with matter or without matter, except for the two complexions which are hot without matter and dry without matter.
However, they disagreed on the hot and dry complexion with matter.
For some said that the cautery is beneficial in it.
And others said the opposite, namely that the cautery is not suitable in the illness which is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat, and it is unsuitable for healing from a hot and dry illness with hot and dry [means].
And he who says the opposite said: that through the cautery help is given in every hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare the human body and its humours to the complexion of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I myself say, through his statement: because experience has already revealed that to me many times.
However, it is not necessary that it come upon that, unless one who is already proven and exercised in the last exercise of the cautery chapter, and has known the diversity of human complexions and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their duration of time.
However, there is no fear from the remaining complexions; and especially in cold and humid illnesses. For now all physicians have agreed upon them, and they have not disagreed in the help provided by the cautery in those cases.
And know, children, that the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach except the member that is cauterized; and does not harm any other member joined to it, except by a small harm.
However, the action of burning medicine reaches what is separated from the members; and perhaps causes illness of difficult healing in the member, and perhaps kills it.
But fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Now, however, this has become known to us through experience, because of the length of service and study with the art, and our standing upon the truth of things; and because of that I am excused from the length of speech.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time in which the cautery should be performed, and they set a better time for the verus.
And I say that the cautery is suitable at all times, because the harm which is incidental to time is submerged in the benefit which is attracted with the cautery.
And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate slowness, because it is feared from them that a greater evil will happen, than the small harm which enters because of time.
And do not let it enter your minds, O children, that which the common people and foolish physicians do not fear, namely that the illness which is cured by cautery does not always return.  And they put this as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think. For the cautery is not, except in the place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries the humours that are the causes of the pains that occur.
However, the cautery excels over medicine in the speed of its cure, and the virtue of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion. And it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the complexion of the infirm person, and the location of his illness, and its strength, and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in him, and that which arrives at him in his acquisition from foods and similar causes, unless there is a disease in which the cautery is administered. A subtle illness in a limb of few superfluities and humours, like a toothache, because of the pain, and things similar to it, it is possible that that pain will not return in it.
But that happens in few cases.
But truly the common people's statement, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, is a correct statement, not in the sense they intend by it. For they believe that there is no cure which can compare with medicine, nor with anything else after the application of cautery.
However, the matter is the opposite of that. The idea that cautery is the last resort of medicine is not the case unless when we apply methods of treatment in some illnesses, and those treatments do not work; then, at the end of the matter, we administer cautery, and it works.  Then, it follows that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not in the sense understood by the common people and many foolish physicians.
However, the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron.  And they did not say this except because of the equal weight and the high quality of its substance.  And they said that the site of the cautery does not produce pus. But that is not absolutely so, for I have already tested it, and found that it does not do so in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it [gold] is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
However, when you apply a cautery of gold in fire, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the desired degree because of the redness of the gold.  And when it approaches the cold, and if you add heat to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Therefore, the craftsman falls away from that practice.  And because of this, cautery with iron is faster and more readily available for us, from the straightforwardness of the operation.
And I indeed have already arranged this chapter on cautery, according to chapters, and have arranged them from head to foot, so that they may alleviate the one seeking what they want from it. Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
This cauterization benefits by controlling moisture and coldness over the brain, which are two causes of headaches, and the excessive flow of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and excessive sleep, and toothache, and sore throat; and universally, all illnesses that arise from coldness, such as paralysis, headaches, epilepsy, and apoplexies, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is that you instruct the ill person to be evacuated primarily with a cleansing, dissolving medicine for the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the ill person, and their age, and their custom.
Then instruct them to shave their head with a razor.
Then make him sit between your hands in a square position, so that he has already placed his hands upon his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever, therefore, your middle finger arrives, mark that place with the cautery. Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, whose form is this. Then place it upon the place marked with the cautery, descending, while your hand is gradually tightened, and you will revolve it.
Then quickly lift your hand, and look at the place.
If you see now exposed from the bone the size of a head of al-kheil, or the size of a ze'herbi, then lift your hand.
And if not, repeat with the iron itself, or with another of the same if it becomes cold, until the bones which I told you appear.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cloth in it, and place it over the place, and leave it for three days.
Then place over it the cloth soaked in butter, and leave it over the place until the eschar of the fire is destroyed. Then treat it with the four-drug ointment, until it is healed.
Now they say that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits; therefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until a certain thickness of bone is burned.
Then shave off whatever has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
And others say that the cautery should be used to reach the very end, until it makes an impression on the bone, so that the bone falls away, which is done like the shape of a kirate, or a tool that women use for embroidering small letters, and they believe that vapors from the head are expelled from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it heals.
However, these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be suitable for all people, except in some cases, according to the path of caution.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better for his health.
For the head weakens due to the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have witnessed in other limbs; and especially when the head of the sick person is naturally weak.  And indeed, the first type of cautery is safer and better in my view, and I use it: therefore, operate with it for safety.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain throughout the head.
Chapter 3.
When chronic pain occurs throughout the head, and it prolongs itself in the sick person, and they use leeches, and cupping, and head-purgations, and oils, and poultices.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with the single cautery, which we have described, and none of those things benefit it, then consider.
For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and not weak, and experiences violent cold, then cauterize with another cautery slightly below the first one.
Then cauterize it over every horn of its head with a cautery, so that the skin is not penetrated, and a quantity of bone, as we have described, is exposed.
And cauterize it with a single cautery on the back of its head, in the place called the *vas* (blood vessel): and it is the place where a cupping glass is placed; and raise your cautery to this, and do not expose bone.
For the sick person experiences intense pain because of that, different from the pain of the other cauterizations of all the head.
And I shall say that this cautery is in its proper place: and it should be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of the head with a finer cautery than that used to cauterize the middle of the head.
And this is its shape.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with a burning medicine and with iron.
Chapter Four.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is purged with cleansing remedies, and the remaining treatment, which I mentioned in the divisions of illnesses, is administered and does not benefit the whole [condition]: then cauterization is performed there in two ways: either cauterization with a burning medicine that is sharp, or with iron. The cautery with a sharp burning medicine is to take one clove of garlic, and to peel it, and to cut off its extremities from the two sides.
Then cut the painful area at a time with a wide lancet, until a place is made under the skin, into which the clove is placed.
Then introduce it into the skin itself, until it is hidden; then tighten above it with a bandage of suitable constriction, and leave it for a period of fifteen hours; then loosen it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days; afterward, place on it a poultice soaked in butter, until the area produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do it with some burning medicines, which I have written in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
The cauterization of it with iron, however, is according to this method.
A cautery iron, whose shape is this.
And it is called a "clavil," because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is something of curvature, and in its middle there is a small protuberance.
Then place it on the area, and hold your hand; and you turn the iron gradually with speed; and let the quantity that is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, like half of it.
And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak lint in salt water, and place it over the area, and leave it for three days; then place the lint with butter; afterward treat with ointment until healed. And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife edge.
And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not the old one properly.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the old hemicrania.
Chapter V.
When treating hemicrania, using what we have said from the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and if the treatment does not help; and you see from the illness that what we have said about the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient, then it is necessary to heat the cautery's knife edge until it becomes white after you have marked the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or nearly that; and place your hand in one place and squeeze it until you cut the artery, and reach the bone. However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves during chewing, lest the side or the nerve that moves it be burned, from which spasm may result.
And be on guard, and careful about the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut.
For in its cutting there is fear, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not diligent nor experienced; and he abandons the operation at the beginning.
And I will come with a reminder of the regimen for the flow of blood arising from the artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
If you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick man tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery, which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives.
For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial. Concerning the method of cauterization in earache.
Chapter VI. When pain in the ear occurs from cold, and is treated with remedies, and the rest of the treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then apply a cautery with fire; and it is that which is called the Point, whose shape is this.
Then the points, after its ignition, are applied in a circle around the entire ear, as it revolves; or in a circle around each ear, if the pain is in both at the same time.
And distance yourself with the cautery a little from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with encaustic; and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points in each ear, and approximately like that.
Then treat the places until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Torture.
Chapter VII.
Torture that is treated with cauterization is only from the species that occur from phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of diseases. And avoid cauterization of the species that occurs from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this species of torture with emetics, and purges, and gargles, and your treatment is of no avail, then it is necessary that you cauterize the afflicted person with three cauteries: one near the root of the ear, and a second a little lower from its temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the afflicted part.
Because softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the tip of the upper ear, slightly below the horn of the head: and another at the temple, whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
And hold your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type from a knife, whose form is already mentioned: however, it is not a little thinner than that, as you see: and it is necessary that the knife has a little superfluous thickness in it. Then treat the places with what preceded, until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in old Apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When the apoplexy is chronic, and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment does not benefit, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries over each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and with a cautery at the back of the head, according to what preceded: and the method of cautery should be according to what preceded.
Also, it is cauterized with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and it is more of a last resort.
Then, treat it with what has preceded.
Concerning the method of cauterization in oblivion.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that in the drink, first be given to the sick person large hyerae and pills that cleanse the brain.
Then shave the entire head of the sick person, and place on the back of his head a plaster of mustard described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times. For this is the method of cautery; and do it according to the same order which I said there. If, therefore, he is healed by it, it is good.
If not, then make for him three cauteries on the posterior part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cautery the thickness of a finger.
Then treat the cautery with what preceded it.
If however you wish an addition, and the sick person is able to tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle.
If you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he is healed: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form that was stated previously.
Concerning the method of cauterization in paralysis and softening.
Chapter X.
You should proceed in the cleansing of the head with hygeia, and with what we have said.
Then shave the patient's head; afterward cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on every horn of the head, and with a cautery on its posterior part, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck.
However, if in the illness there is a need for softening of the body by more than those, and the patient is enduring, and the illness is severe, then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and the last with a cautery, until his skin is largely burned away, and raise your hand.
Then treat him until he is healed; and thus is the cautery of Olive.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that one whose epilepsy is from phlegm. Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the other treatment that we have described in the division: when the patient is strong, or is tolerant in accepting medicines.
However, if he is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing mastications for the brain are administered, many days before that with the improvement of foods.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the method; and with another cautery on his occiput, and with a cautery over every horn of his head.
If however the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I said for the paralytic, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the manner that preceded. If however the patient is a child, then place a delicate cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Melancholy.
Chapter XII.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries which we have stated for the paralytic.
And if the cause of the melancholy is an excess inclined to melancholy, and the body of the sick person is damp, then give him in a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what has preceded in the division; then shave the head of the sick person, and afterwards make a neatly fashioned little roll out of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head; and the sick person, seated upright, should be held in place on all sides.
Then apply the liniment. And it is better made from old sheep's butter.
And heat it over a fire with a measured heat, such that a finger can tolerate it when inserted into it.
Then apply it in a circle to the middle of his head, and leave it until it cools.
Do this to the sick person once a week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small points on it, while holding the cautery with your hand: indeed, let it be smelled.
For this type of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Then place a cloth soaked in butter, or chicken fat, upon it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in descending water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When you are declared the beginning of water in the eye by the signs, which I have said in the division, then begin and drink the weak one, with that which cleanses his head.
And keep him from all moistures, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him above the two temples with two cauteries, if it is the beginning of the descent of water in both eyes simultaneously; or from one side, if it is the beginning of water in one eye; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin; and let the cauteries be of the same length as the width of the temples; and beware of the flow of blood.
If you see anything from him, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the wisdom that is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting of them, and the precaution from the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, beneath the two bones, with two cauteries finally applied.
Concerning the method of cauterization in ancient eye diseases.
Chapter Fourteen.
When the eye's tears are chronic, constant; and are on the veins and arteries that are in the exposed exterior of the head, it is confirmed that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery I have described at the beginning of descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
And if it needs further treatment, then cauterize it on every side carefully around the eye, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterization for nasal foul odor.
Chapter Fifteen.
When you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help; then hurry and give the infirm decoctions in a drink for three nights; afterwards shave his head and cauterize it with a middle cautery, with an olive cautery.
Then cauterize it with a claw cautery, with two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
And guard against the artery, lest you strike it.
And this is the shape of the Claw cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the softening of the eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by sickness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with a single cautery, with this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on every side; and they should be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be, according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not bring your hand with the cautery, but in accordance with the amount that the third eyelid is to be burned.
And this is the shape of the cautery according to this lunar cautery method.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are turned inward, pricking the eye. Chapter XVII.
The cautery is in it according to two methods: either cautery with fire, or cautery with a burning medicine.
In cautery with fire, first instruct the sick person to remove his hairs, if he is one who cleans them, until they are lengthened and made equal. If, however, they prick him at their origin, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they are born.
When therefore they are born and made equal, then place the sick person's head in your bosom; then mark upon the eyelid of his eyes with ink, a mark that is in the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place a cloth soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over the eye.
Then apply a cautery, whose shape is this.
Then cauterize over the shape which you have marked, gradually in many stages, until the skin's surface, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned away.
And the sign of the success of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting, and the hairs rising near the puncture of the eye.
Therefore raise your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Then place upon it a poultice with butter, until the eschar is removed.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
If any of the hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid softens, then again cauterize that place, as you did at first.
If however the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place, and made even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
Concerning the method of cauterization with a burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter XVIII.
You should instruct the sick person to let the hairs fall out until they are lengthened and made even.
Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from paper on cloth.
Then take from known soap, and from unsoaked lime, one ounce or nearly that of each weight: then grind them together with good trituration, and make it quickly, so that it does not grow cold.
Then take some of that from the pan and place it on the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and put it on the eyelid of one or two eyes.
And place a soaked cloth in egg white under the eye: and let the sick person's head be in your bosom.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it for a short time.
And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the medicine's biting: for its biting is found to be like fire.
While, therefore, this biting that he finds persists, then release the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When, therefore, the biting subsides, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid rising, as it rises with a contraction from fire, or with an incision, it is well; and if not, then apply more medicine to the spot where the medicine does not take effect and does not darken, until your operation is equalized and the eye contracts.
Then place upon it Cotum with butter, until the skin of the burn is eradicated.
Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, at the operation, to observe the utmost care, lest anything of the medicine fall into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after days, and some hair struggles into the eye, then apply medicine again to the place that softens from the eyelid itself, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness.
Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be; and the way of righteousness is not hidden from him who is diligent in this art.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the tear duct fistula.
Chapter XIX.
When you treat a fistula, if, as we have said in the divisions of diseases, your treatment does not help, then, it is necessary to cauterize it according to this method.
Command the sick person to place his head in your lap, and let the attendant hold his head in their hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with his head.
Then place a heated poultice in the white of an egg, or in psyllium mucilage, on his eye; then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you want it to penetrate to the other end, and if you want it held upward thus.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, upon it.
And hold your hand near the cautery, from the eye to the nose, so that your hand does not wander or the sick person is disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
If therefore you reach the beginning of your cautery up to the bone, it will be well.
And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a compress with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment until it is healed. If forty days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine to it until the bone is exposed, and scrape it according to what appears in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first [surgeons] said.
Direct your attention to the location of the fistula, and cut it open; then place a fine camahan, that is, a fine cannula, of this shape, into the fissure.
Pour into it a drachma of liquefied lead, and hold your hand with a good retention cannula, and let the sick person not move at all, so that the liquefied lead does not run or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place on the sick person's eye a poultice infused in egg white, or in water.
For lead burns the fistula location and heals it with a remarkable cure.
If the fistula is cured with what we have said about the cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nostril opening, and to return the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what will come to its own proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing lip fissures.
Chapter XX.
Often fissures occur in the lip, called "pili," especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, as we said in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not help, then use a small knife-shaped cautery with fire, according to this form.
And its concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then treat it with a cautery, until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a fistula of the mouth.
Chapter XXI.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth; then it produces pus, and breaks open; afterward it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and treatment does not benefit it, then it is necessary to cauterize with a cautery according to the quantity that fits within the fistula.
Then introduce the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and its farthest point; do it once or twice.
Then treat it afterward, with what we said about treatment, until it is healed.
If therefore the pus is removed, and it heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place, and remove the corrupted bone according to what will appear on its surface.
Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
Chapter XXII.
When the gum softens due to moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help, then place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Then, with the cautery, whose form will follow, place the cannula over the tooth, and quickly insert the heated cautery into it; hold your hand there for a short while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire already reaching the root of the tooth.
And lift your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, as you wish.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour; and let him spit it out.
For the moving tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
Chapter XXIII.
When toothache is due to cold, either cold or a worm is in it, and treatment with medicines is of no avail, then cautery is applied to it in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
However, its cautery with butter is to take cow's butter, and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a vessel.
Then take a wick, and wrap it around the tip of the probe.
Then immerse it in the boiled butter, and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools: then repeat it several times, until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool, or a wick, in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place hot iron upon it, until the fire reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Its cauterization with fire is to apply a bronze or iron cannula. And let there be something of its thickness, so that the sharpness of fire does not reach the sick person's bone.
Then apply the cautery, whose form shall come, and place it on that tooth, and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Do it several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day or on another.
And it is necessary, in the application of that cautery, that the sick person fill their mouth with good butter, and hold it for one hour; then spit it out.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever extremity of the instrument you can: and this is the form of the cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ulcers.
Chapter Twenty-four.
When ulcers are from phlegm and cold humors, and are not yielding to digestion by medicines, and the instrument of digestion does not quickly effect them, then use a concave cautery, whose form is this.
Having two open extremities, so that smoke may escape from the cautery at the other extremity, and place it heated upon the abscess once and twice, if it requires this, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice infused in butter, until that which the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with a tooth ointment, until the form of the cannula is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
Chapter XXV.
When humidities overcome the bronchial passage, and especially when it is with a cold temperament, then it is necessary that the infirm person be evacuated first with loosening medicines.
Then cauterize it in the vicinity of the root of the throat in a depressed place; and be careful not to reach with the cautery the throat itself, nor the skin, except a part of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck at the last vertebra thereof, and let the cautery be narrow according to the manner which preceded.
Then treat it with that which preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in diseases of the Lung and Cough.
Chapter XXVI.
When cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the sick person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the disease is old, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in depressed, gentle, empty places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be of the cannula shape as preceded.
And if you wish your cauterization to be by puncturing with a cautery, which is called *Punctum*, whose form preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures up to as if another.
Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Therefore, the cauterization is alleviated when you do it with three cauteries at once.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the titillico, in the dislocation of the humerus.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated because of humours, and does not fix itself in the hour of its return from the dislocation, until it has become accustomed to returning, and then is dislocated by a slight movement, which happens as we have already testified, then you must first reduce the dislocation.
Then the patient is to be placed supine on his back, or on his healthy side.
Then raise the skin that is in the inner titillico towards the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then, using a cautery with two prongs. Whose shape is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will be with four cauteries.
And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, wherefore the shape of the cauterization is then of six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the thread.
And this is the shape of the cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added above this manner, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Then place on the cautery crushed leeks with salt.
Then cause the infirm one to adhere to stillness, so that the limb does not move at any time, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is to the upper parts, and rarely does that happen, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicular cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed; and the infirm person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When cold and many humidities occur in the stomach, until they pull it away from its complexion, and the catarrhs multiply towards it, and frequent methods of treatment do not help: then it is necessary that the sick person be laid on their back, and extend their legs and hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery below the breastbone, the size of one finger with a pointed cautery, and two cauteries below it on either side, one cautery each, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
And lengthen between each so that they do not join, when they will make pus. And let the depth of the cautery be the quantity of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form, without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form, let the cautery by which this is done be one according to the form of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it with that which frightens him with this cautery: and it is, that you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity that you want with ink; then cauterize it with the cautery of the point; then treat it with the treatment that preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Chapter XXIX.
When pain occurs in the liver from cold and moisture, or from thick wind, until it emerges from its natural complexion by the expulsion of excess, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the sick person be placed on their back, and mark with ink three cauteries according to this shape, and this same quantity, on the lower liver beneath the hypochondria, where the human elbow reaches: and let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body; and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
And let the quantity of that which is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, the quantity of half of it not added: and let the sick person be standing on their feet.
If, however, he is not standing, then let him be lying down, having already extended his legs and raised his arms. This is the shape of the cautery.
And it is possible for you, indeed, to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And guard yourself so that you do not proceed to the extreme in cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, wherefore the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: for the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
Concerning the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
Chapter XXX.
When a discharge occurs, and you wish to know if the abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient is afflicted with pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is sharp, intense pain; and you see now, that the treatment has fatigued its physicians.
Therefore, the patient should lie on their back upon a pillow.
Then mark the site of the abscess with ink; then apply a cautery resembling a ray.
And this is its shape.
And cauterize with it one cautery, until the entire skin is burned and reaches the pus, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for discharges, until it is healed.
And it is not appropriate for one to use this type of cautery unless one's study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have come with experience many times; for then may one dare upon such an operation.
But truly, to leave it be, is better in my opinion.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Pleuresia.
Chapter XXXI.
The ancients said that cautery with aristolochia roots, for a cold pleurisy, according to this method.
And it is that you take from the dry, long aristolochia roots, one root longer than the rest, which is found there, and it should be the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil, and light it in the fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery at the point where the fork's junction meets the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly sloping downwards towards the part below the beard.
And with two cauteries also at the point between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backwards; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And with three cauteries from behind: one at the point between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from both sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
And you should not press your hand with the cautery, but it should be on the skin, clearly smelling. And some ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery of iron like a ray: and they burn, and thrust it inward into that which is between the ribs, until they reach with it the abscess itself, and pus comes out; just as we have said concerning the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with the cautery there is a fear that either the weak person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Spleen, Chapter XXXII.
When you treat the illness of the spleen, with what we have said about treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then the cautery is used in it according to three methods, which are all correct.
One of which is to make three cauteries, or four, drawing a line along the length of the spleen, according to the shape of the liver cauteries, whose figure preceded.
And let there be between each cautery a quantity equal to the thickness of a finger, or more or less.
And let the method of the cautery be, as we said, in the cautery of the liver, equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the weak person be lying on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you heat the cautery having two points, which we mentioned in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus; and elevate the skin, which is directly over the spleen, where the left elbow of the sick person reaches; and let your elevation of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then introduce the two very hot points until with them you penetrate the skin on the other side; then withdraw the cautery; therefore four cauteries are made. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three points.
Then care for the cautery after you let it emit pus for many days; for it is more beneficial than any of the other preceding treatments.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Chapter XXXIII.
The cautery does not fall in dropsy, unless properly applied.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment, which we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not work, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery on the stomach, and another on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not remove the weak one from treatment after the cautery with that: for it is necessary that two intentions be aggregated to him: and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be nail-shaped, according to its previous form; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previous form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Feet and Legs. Chapter Thirty-Four.
When ulcers fester in a hydrops patient, and are filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot, in the area between the auricular and annular bones: and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand again, and do not repeat it at all.
For the yellow water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this form.
Then, make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the cutting end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below that, approximately in the middle of the leg; and make two cauteries on each thigh; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water will sweat out from it; then treat it with the rest of the things we have mentioned.
Concerning the method of cauterization in abdominal swelling. Chapter 35.
When the abdominal swelling is from cold and dampness, weakening the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with the methods of healing, and is not healed; and you see the sick person tolerating a cautery of abundant strength, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a small nail cautery; and a large cautery on the hypochondrium, above the other hypochondrium, or with two cauteries.
And if you see excessive moisture, and the sick person tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the breastbone, and a cautery on each hip; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not fail.
Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they arise from thick, cold humors, or corrupt moisture, and are treated with what we mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower spine of the back a little below the navel, triangularly, and with a cautery under the navel as if with two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face become ulcerated, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, as previously stated: and with a cautery on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a nail-cautery: and leave the cautery open for a time: then treat him until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing piles after their excision.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you excise piles, then heat the cautery which is like a ray.
Then introduce the heated cautery into the excised pile: and with the back of your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein through which blood flows: do it once, or twice. If therefore the piles are numerous, then cauterize each one with the cautery according to what we have described.
Then treat them with what you apply from ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on the anus, it is more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
When the patient does not submit to the incision and operation we described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is healed with a cautery.
When therefore a fistula occurs in someone, and it grows old, pus runs from it, and corrupted humors.
Therefore, it is more fitting that you probe it with a thin probe.
Then determine its depth with the probe.
Then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray.
Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula itself and the amount into which the cautery entered. And repeatedly apply the cautery to it, until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your need.
And beware of burning the nerve, if there is one there, or large vein; or if the fistula goes to the bladder, or to the intestines, then beware of all these places.
And do not do it unless the fistula is in a fleshy place, and you think it is not penetrating.
Then treat the place until it is healed.
If however the place is sealed, and the matter is cut away from it, and it remains thus for a long time, then know that it is now healed completely.
And if they do not cut away the matter from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupt bone deep within it, or something like that from those things: whose mention will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Kidneys.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or from heavy wind, and it diminishes because of this to the point of weakness of the patient, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the almethen, above the kidneys themselves, cauterizing each kidney with a pointed cauterium, the description of which preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time on the same almeidatu.
Therefore three lines will come.
Therefore, the last will be more beneficial.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Chapter XL. When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, to the point that the patient no longer retains urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic crest begin. Cauterize from the right side of the summit and another from the left side: and let the length of each cauterization be according to the size of a thumb's width. And cauterize it with an inferior dorsal cautery, or with two cauteries, if you need it. And let it be according to the preceding cauterization.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb. Chapter XLI.
When cold and dampness occur in the womb, and it is prevented from conception, and her menses are corrupted, and their expulsion is delayed, and pain occurs to her upon their arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize it with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in cauterizing the bladder, and with a cautery on the lower back, or with two cauteries.  And let the cautery be of the closing type.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Chapter XLII.
When mucous humors are discharged into the anus, and become the cause of its exit from its place: and a sign of this is that the leg is prolonged over the other, when they are compared together; and the place of the dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the afflicted area above the anus itself with a similar circular cautery; after you mark it with ink around the anus, as it revolves; and that the anus itself should fall within the center of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
If this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the amount of thickness of the entire skin.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica. Chapter XLIII.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and moisture; and the patient is treated with what we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment is not effective, and it is prolonged; then it is necessary to free the patient from the gross humours with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar remedies.
Then cauterize it.
And the method of cautery in it is according to two methods: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.
Cautery with fire, is according to many methods.
One of which is to cauterize above the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make them a good or bad depth.
And let the space that is between each cautery be the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes however, a cautery is made in the middle, over the head of the hip itself.
Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the hip dislocation, by one: so that the circle will contain the entire hip.
And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If however it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries upon the thigh, upon the place to which the afflicted person there points, where the pain is, and with your cautery upon the ankle four fingers to the wild side a little while: and let the cautery be a knife-like one. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
If the afflicted person indicates that the pain extends nearly to the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a point cautery, three, or four, or more, if it requires it.
And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-like cautery.
And beware in all your cauterizations, that you do not finish with the cautery so as to burn a nerve, or a great artery, and draw through it upon the afflicted person a bad harm, or contraction.
And I myself have already seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and finished in their cauterization, and the leg was swollen, until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole was perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then there followed a dissolution of the belly, and death after that.
If the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this method.
And certain wise men said in cauterization of the buttock, of which cautery this is the method.
Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter be the half of a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date-stone, or a little less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
And let the space between each cautery be the amount of a thumb's knot: and let the cauteries be open on both sides: and let their height be like one knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle of iron fitting well into the cauteries.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in fire, until it glows red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed upon the box of the buttock of the sick person lying on their healthy side.
Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at one time.
Then leave him for three days.
Afterwards apply plasters with butter, and leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Albucasis says, "By this kind of cautery, my sons, we have used little, because of the terror of its appearance and because we find few who will wait upon it.
However, it is a good cautery for him who suffers and finds its place with him.
The cautery, however, is with burning medicines, so that you make two samia having a perforated armilla, into which descends the hinge of its door of bronze or iron, the length of a wall; of which in the height of them shall be two knots or like to them.
And let the space between both quantities be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above; and let that which contains them adhere to each other, according to this form.
Then place it upon a box of ashes, the sick person lying upon the healthy side.
And press your hand upon the box of ashes forcefully.
Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been warmed a little with fire, and hold it for the amount of an hour: and let the sick person tolerate its scorching, and its burning, for he finds the scorching like fire, until the scorching ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the hot water from the whole ash with fresh water; then leave it for three days.
And put butter upon it, until the blackness of the burning is removed; and leave it for several days, and pus will run from it.
For it is the last in assistance.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a poultice on it containing water, as you did for the ash equally.
And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Take alkali and quicklime, of both one part: grind both, and place them in a new pot, the bottom of which is pierced with one small hole, according to the amount that the ray will enter: and place another glass pot beneath the bottom of the pot: and pour over the alkali and lime with sweet water, so that both are submerged by a finger: after which you press them with your hand with a good pressure: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water and pour it over more lime; and strain it until it is renewed.
For it will then be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many surgical operations, and in cauterizing other limbs.
Because it produces the effect of fire itself.
And among the medicaments with which incisions are cauterized are also, like tessie, and honey of almonds, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
And Galen, indeed, narrating, recounted the treatment of a certain man from the ancients, with which the pain of the hip and sciatic vein were cured; and he magnified it to be very great.
And he said, that he did not need any other treatment, and that he was healed in one instance, until he related, that perhaps he had entered a bath carried, and emerged from it already healthy. And it is to be taken from green seitaragi; and if green is not found, let dry, fresh, be taken; and it should be thoroughly rubbed with some fat, and placed over the hip, where the pain is, or the leg, or the thigh; and it should be bound, and left for a period of three hours, or for the amount of time the sick person feels the sedation of the burning.
Then introduce him into the bath.
When therefore his body becomes moist, introduce him onto the couch.
For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
And know that it is not appropriate for anyone to use a cautery with these remedies unless after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides also said that the dung of goats, when cauterized with it the sciatic vein, benefits it: and the cautery is done in this way.
Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep place, which is between the toe and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Then take dry goat dung, and ignite it in fire, until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it upon the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Then repeat it.
Therefore do not cease to do this, until the sensation on the affected area is lessened and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called the Vaccine cautery.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Chapter XLIV.
Sometimes pain in the back occurs from many causes, either from an accident, or a blow, or the evacuation of excess fluids, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter.  A cautery is not applied, however, except in this one case which occurs from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after the patient's evacuation with foul pills and similar remedies, three lines should be made on the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the affected area itself. After marking with ink five cauteries on each line, or more, depending on the patient's tolerance, the cauterization should be performed with the cautery-puncture method.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using the medial cautery-clavil, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the beginning stages of a hump.
Chapter XLV.
This illness often occurs in young infants.
And the sign of its beginning in children is that there occurs constriction in their breathing upon raising themselves and moving; and you find in the last thoracic vertebrae and their processes that it has already begun to project above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see it, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is round, according to this shape.
And let the cautery encompass the entire vertebral part equally; and if you wish to cauterize the vertebral circumference with a pointed cautery, make two or three lines of punctures, and let the punctures be close together.
Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware, lest you administer the cautery to the hump which is formed in nerve spasm.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in gout and joint pains. Chapter XLVI.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors that are shed into any member of the body, then when pains happen in the feet, it is customary for physicians to properly call it Gout.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them.
And it is that one should cauterize it after evacuation, in the circumference of the joints of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
This is its shape.
And if you need to prick on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries, on all sides, with this same claw-shaped cautery. If, however, more of this cautery is necessary for you, then cauterize it. And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If, however, the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we said about the cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, then prick the points in the circumference of the foci, as two lines revolve.
If, however, pain remains in the fingers, then prick them, above each knot, and above the hand's ridge.
If, however, the pains ascend after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not evacuate the sick person from good regimen, from the reception of medicines.
For if a good regimen is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cauterization.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Ruptures.
Chapter XLVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groins, and the intestine or the scrotum descends to the testicle, and it is close to starting, then it is necessary that you order the sick person to give up eating on his day.
And let him use laxatives, that the stool may descend from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back; and order him to hold his breath until it emerges, or the scrotum, or the intestine appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink under the rupture above the pubic bone, with a sign whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then cauterize with a cautery, of which this is the form, until it becomes white, and throws off sparks.
Then reduce the intestine, or scrotum, to its cavity.
Then let the assistant place his hand over the spot, so that the intestine does not come out; and you have now opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a cushion beneath him, and another servant above his legs, and another above his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark, your hand holding the cautery standing straight.
And hold it until you reach the mouth with it: or repeat it another time with it, if you have not reached the mouth with it the first time.
And carefully observe, during your cauterization, for the exit of the intestine, so that you do not burn it, and that it may result in the patient's death, or great harm.
And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your operation is not beneficial.
And the cautery for infants should be slender, according to their size.
Then treat with the remaining ointments, until it is healed.
And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary to give him nourishment for the duration of his treatment, that will soothe his belly, so that the intestines will not be discharged during straining and evacuation.
Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him keep it for another forty days.
For when he uses this regimen, he is thus healed completely.
However, when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and there is a wish that they not increase, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is cauterized be thenceforth like a third of it.
Then treat him with what we have said: and it will not increase.
And now some of the first have said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the Rupture, and another line towards the lower. And place your hand in the middle with the cautery clamp.
But the first cautery is easier and better. Concerning the method of cauterizing in pains due to a fall or a blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When, in certain limbs, pain occurs from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery of every limb be a cautery according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain therefrom.
If, therefore, it is healed by the first cautery, it is well.
If not, then repeat the cautery upon it.
Because it is customary for these pains to shift from one limb to that which is near it.
Therefore, you should pursue them with cautery until the afflicted one is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Leprosy.
Chapter XLIX.
Leprosy patients are sometimes greatly helped by cauterization.
And especially the kind of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider it.
If, therefore, the leprosy is intractable, and you have treated it with what we stated in the division, and it has not subsided or ceased, and you fear that the corruption will spread to the entire constitution of the patient: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the forehead, and a second below it towards the front at the end of the hair, and two above the two temples, and one behind the nape of the neck.
And hold your hand with the cautery for a short time, until a small indentation is impressed on the area, and the outer layers are loosened: so that the expulsion of gross vapors from it may be eased, and cauterize also the spleen with the cautery, according to what has been previously stated.
But if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is clearly visible: then it is necessary that you cauterize with the cauteries we mentioned on the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and with six on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the haunches near the base of the tail and one above it, in the middle of the buttocks; and with two on the groins, one on each groin, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the soft parts of his chest; and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet, and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and on the soft parts of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are above the heel, so that you do not burn them. And sometimes a cautery is applied to the breastbone, and another to the stomach, and another to the liver.
And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more beneficial and helpful it is.
And know that the patient does not experience pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numb.
And there should be cauteries of various sizes, according to the members and joints, according to what has been previously described in the types of instruments.
Chapter L.
When any limb is in a state of stupor, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that stupified limb with cauteries, according to the merit of its size, whether great or small.
And let your cautery enter into the thickness of the skin a little.
Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
And sometimes it is cauterized for a kind of stupor which occurs in the hand and foot, in the spinal column of the back at the exit points of the nerves which move that limb: and the stupor is removed.
But let no one presume upon it, unless he is wise in the anatomy of the limbs, and the exit of the moving nerves of the body.
On the method of cauterization in Albaras.
Chapter LI.
When Albaras becomes old and nothing from the arts of medicine helps it, then cauterize over it with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its colour is changed.
Then treat it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and the blood of a dove, and the blood of a swallow: of each one part: let these all be mixed, and be smeared on a cloth, and applied to the place until it heals.
On the method of cauterization in Cancer.
Chapter LII.
When the Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it revolves.
However, the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
However, it does not seem right to me, because I fear it will become ulcerated, and I have seen it happen several times. And it is more correct that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries. Concerning the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Chapter LIII.
When someone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, either because of an excess causing it, or because of the patient's age, when he is decrepit with little blood, or because of the time, and the need to hasten the maturation of the Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it will hasten with maturation.
If however you want to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, of which this is the form.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the patient, so that the course of the purulent matter may be alleviated.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a corroding evil. Chapter LIIII.
Corrosion is not except corruption walking in a member, and it corrodes it; just as fire eats dry wood.
If therefore you see corrosion in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then apply many cauteries of fire, small and large clamps, according to what will be suitable for the place in which the corrosion is.
Then cauterize it from every part until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing of it remains at all. Then leave it for three days, and put powdered sulfur with oil on the cauterized places, until all the eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then again cauterize that which remains of the corrupted places.
And it is sometimes cured by corroding medicine.
For it indeed rises in the place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker benefit; and I have already said that its cauterization with sharp medicine is in division; therefore, take it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in corns and warts. Chapter LV.
This ailment frequently occurs in the lower parts of the feet, and it is a thick, filtered substance that harms the foot. And cautery in them is indeed in two ways: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Concerning the cautery with fire, you should make a concave cautery like a bird of prey's feather, made of iron, the size of the corn all around, and have thin edges.
Then place it, heated, upon the corn. Then revolve the hand with the cautery around the corn, until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn, and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus. Then plaster it with crushed wild mallows and salt, and leave the plaster upon it overnight. For it will be rooted out from its roots.
Then treat the place with a generative flesh ointment until it is healed.
If they are not converted, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then apply a cautery to them with hot water.  And it is, that you should take a cannula of bronze, or iron, or of vulture's feather, and place it upon the corn, or whitlow.
Then pour a small quantity of hot water into the cannula, hold your hand still, and gently rotate it with the pressure of your hand for a short time, so that the edge of the cannula may press against the root of the corn, and the hot water find its way to the depth, to the root of the corn: and let the infirm person wait for a while upon the biting of the hot water for one hour.
Then release it, for the corn is rooted out with its roots.
So do with them one by one, until you come upon all that are of them in the body.
Then treat them after they are rooted out, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Trembling.
Chapter LVI.
When trembling occurs in someone from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four cauteries, or five, over the spinal vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on his chest with a cautery, and on his stomach with a cautery.
For trembling ceases with the cautery of the olive, and the health of the cold sickness is hastened. Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter LVII.
Sometimes foul things, that is, pustules, are expelled in the body of Albathir, which are made from corrupted gross matter.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary first to cauterize every pustule on the head with a delicate cautery made of myrtle wood, whose tip has been ignited.
Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Or with a lenticular cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner: and they are not increased: and the superfluity causing them is broken, and they are healed from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Chapter LVIII. Often a blood flow from an artery occurs, which is cut in a wound, that happens externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a limb, and similar to them: and it becomes difficult to sever it.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery; and press it firmly, until the blood is blocked beneath your finger, and nothing more flows out from it. Then place small, olive-shaped cauteries, and many more large ones, in the fire; and blow on them until they are very hot.
Then take one of them, whether small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery is ruptured, and apply the cautery to the vein itself, after you have quickly removed your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is severed.
If it is expelled when you lift your finger from the artery's opening, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries that are prepared in the fire. Therefore, do not cease to do this, one after another, until the blood is severed.
And beware, lest you burn the nerve that is there, and another harm befall the sick person. And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to sever it, especially when the artery is large, unless with one of the four methods.
Or with cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is severed.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is severed. Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Or let medicinal substances of a nature to sever the blood be placed upon it, and let it be constricted with a fitting cushion constriction.
However, whoever administers its excision with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or the application of burning things, and similar matters, does not truly benefit it, unless rarely.
If however this should befall someone, and a physician or medicine be not present for them, then let them begin with the application of the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have narrated, and its strong constriction, until the blood is blocked from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
And the finger should not be removed, from above it with very cold water, constantly, until the blood is congealed, and thickened, and cut away. And meanwhile let him consider what it needs from cautery, or from medicine.
End of the First Part.
Book of Albucasis's Surgery Part II. Concerning Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds, and similar matters.
We have already said in the First Chapter, every illness in which it is suitable to use cautery with fire and a burning medicine, and the occasions for it, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries. And I have placed there chapters from the head to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter the same way, so that the seeker might have his question relieved. And before I begin that, it is necessary that you learn, O children, that in this chapter is from the terror that is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And on account of that, it is necessary that there be more caution in it, since in the operation that is in this chapter, many times evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or an incision over an abscess, or the opening of an exit, or the treatment of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or an incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which is associated trembling, and fear, and death occurs in many of them.
And I warn you, lest that in which there is hesitation befall you, for sometimes there come to you in this art the manners of men with the manners of illnesses.
For among them is he who is angry with his illness, and death is easy for him, because of the intensity of what he finds in his illness and the length of its malice.
And with illness is the fear that signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his lyre, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful. Therefore you ought not to agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be more intense than your greed and your rapacity.
And do not presume upon anything from it unless after certain knowledge, which verifies to you that to which a praiseworthy succession has arrived.
And use in the treatment of all your sick people, prognostication and indication of that to which health is fittingly directed.
For in that is help for you concerning the acquisition of fame and glory, and of memory and praise.
May God inspire you, children, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you guidance and inspiration, for it is in his hand.
And I have indeed arranged this chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on the cautery, from the neck to the feet: so that your seeking of it, and what you need from it, may be alleviated.
Concerning the treatment of Water which collects in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this ailment often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it happens also from a hidden cause which is not known.
And I myself have not seen this illness in others than children: and death has hastened to every one whom I have seen of them: therefore, it has seemed good to me to omit the operation on it.
And I myself have seen one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day until it could not sit upon itself, because of the size of its head: and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture, indeed, either gathers between the skin and the bone, or gathers under the bone above the sinus.
And the operation on it, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then one should make a single fissure in the middle of the head, in width, and the length of the fissure should be like two knots, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of a lancet.
If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place those two fissures, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head open from every side, and water is depressed when you press it with your hand inwards, and that is not hidden from you: then you should make a fissure in the middle of the head with three fissures, according to this method.
And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Then apply a liniment of wine and oil to it until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with sutures and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound with equality.
And feed the sick person with all dry foods of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes there is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and the filling of water appear to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the sick person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Concerning the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When cataracts befall someone in the eyes or chest, and it becomes longstanding, and treatment with medicines does not help, then the ultimate treatment for it is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to cut them, it is necessary that the sick person shave his head.
Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Then the sick person should tie his neck with any cloth he has.
Then consider where the vein beats.
And the places of both are the places which are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in some men.
Then mark with ink over each: and cut each with a spatula carefully on both sides, the incision reaching to the bone: and let it be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery, and cut it upwards with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be like two fingers joined together.
For when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating flow, which leaps to the interior with frequent jumps.
If however the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth.
Then mark with ink, and cut down to the mouth.
And that which ought to be emitted of blood is six ounces, and perhaps you emit from it more, or less. All that according to the quantity that appears to you from the weakness of the sick person and the fullness of his artery.
Then consider the wound.
Then if anything remains at the mouth from the sifac, then cut it, so that a hot abscess does not occur: then bind the wound with bandages of linen cloth.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man suffers from chronic hemicrania, or acute catarrhs due to acrid humors, and heat in the temple muscles, or old, severe, and similar afflictions; and is treated by methods of medical cure, and it does not help: then we are experienced in these illnesses in the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have narrated.
And the method of the operation in extracting them is that the weak person should shave the hairs which are in the temples, and direct himself to the apparent artery in the temple.
For it indeed shows itself to you from its pulse, and is rarely concealed except in a few people, or by the severity of cold.
If it is concealed from you, then the weak person should press his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Or steam the place with warm water until it appears to you by clear manifestation. Then take the spatula which I have shaped a little earlier. Then scrape the skin with it gently until you reach the artery.
Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards until you draw it out of the skin, and cause it to escape from the tissues beneath it on all sides.
If however the artery is fine: then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Then cut off a part of it according to the amount by which its extremities will be elongated and contracted, and so that no blood flow occurs.
For if it is not cut and if it is not severed, the blood does not rise completely. Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to three.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk or of alhohod cords, so that putrefaction does not quickly reach it before the wound's consolidation, and blood flow occurs.
Then cut away the excess which is between the two ligatures.
Do that at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery, up to the bone, with a knife-cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in place of the same work.
And it is better work, unless the patient has a fever or is of a hot temperament.
Because cauterization is from among those things which help in ending humidities.
Therefore it is a better help.
And after the extraction of the arteries, the place should be filled with old cotton: and pads well made should be placed upon it.
And after the removal, it should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
If, meanwhile, while you are working, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hurry to cut it off with a cauterizing instrument, or to fill the place with zegi; and bind your hand tightly, until the blood is stopped.
If none of those are present for you, then place your finger on the area, until the blood clots.
And apply the area with water of intense cold, until the sharpness subsides, and it is bound as necessary.
And because what is lighter and easier to extract than an artery, is to cauterize the vein with this cauterium having two blades; and let the sharpness of the two blades be similar to an almond.
However, they are of much less sharpness than two blades.
Because if they are sharp, like two blades, the cold affects both, and they do not cut flesh with speed.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is severed quickly; with this, therefore, the work is better than any other, and lighter, and easier.
And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with ink; and place both of them intensely hot, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places, so that that which is between its extremities may be lengthened.
For they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of cautery.
Concerning the treatment of acute and persistent lacrimal discharge from the eyes.
Chapter IV.
When there is a constant flow of tears, and their course is from the veins that are on the outside of the skull: and no medicinal treatment with medicines helps them, and you see the sick person's face already red, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like the crawling of ants: and his eyes are weakened, damp, so that their eyelashes are already corroded with the corrosion: and his eyelids are inflamed from the severity of the tears: then the ancients needed this operation in their treatment, and they called this treatment, with a Knife.
And it is that you should instruct the sick person to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Then, make three equally spaced incisions along the length of the forehead: and let the length of each incision be about two fingers wide, and one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly along the length away from the movement of the temples, and the third on the other side: and be careful not to cut the arteries that are on either side: and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two lower jawbones, and let the space of each incision be the amount of three joined fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dry cloths, with which to absorb the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, whose following form is this.
From the incision that is on the temple side, up to the second incision: and scrape away all the skin, that is between the two incisions, with it, as if it were over the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Then withdraw this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp scalpel, with one side smooth, not sharp, on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone; and drive it, until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut with it all the vessels, which descend from the head to the eyes; except that the incision continues up to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after a quantity of blood has flowed out, express the places from clots of coagulated blood. Then place in every fissure a linen cloth from old cotton, and place on them cushions soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar.
And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer a plentiful infusion with lukewarm water.
Then treat it with basil ointment, and with the other remedies used for wounds, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs to the eyes from the interior of the head.
Chapter V.
When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs occur to someone; and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their appearance already debilitated; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is sharp, painful, and injurious pain deep within the head, and a consequent sneezing; then, take from among these occurrences that these matters, and catarrhs, do not come except from many veins.
And the better treatment for them is this.
And it is that you should order the sick person to shave his forehead.
Then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or a little further along the breadth, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision extend to the bone; and move your hand away from the temporal muscles, which move during chewing; until, when the bone is exposed; and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with old cloth, or with linen strips.
Then bind it from above with pads; and soak the pads with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you loosen it, and see that the hot abscess is already lessening: then it is necessary that you rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow: such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony; and prepare a plaster from them, and administer it to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear. Chapter VI. Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a flowing substance, such as water, vinegar, and similar things; or some animal.
Therefore, when a stone, or a kind of stone, falls into the ear, from those things which are not added to, nor grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun. If, therefore, you see a stone, then instill into the ear some of violet oil, or sesame oil.
Then administer its extraction, and make the person sneeze with condiments, and obstruct the nostrils at the coming of the sneeze, after you place around the ear scraps of cloth, or wool, and extend the ear upward.
For it often comes out with this treatment.
If, however, it does not come out, then administer its extraction with Gestes, that is, with fine forceps: the shape of which is this.
If therefore it comes out with the forceps, it is good.
And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine, single-looped hook. If therefore it does not come out through that, then make a tube of bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole deeply, and plug whatever is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no passage for the wind except through the tube; then extract with your suction with strong traction. For many times it comes out with what we have narrated.
If however it does not come out in this way, then take a small amount of  birdlime or glue, with which birds are caught, and place it at the end of a reed after you have neatly wrapped a bit of cotton around it; then insert it into the ear hole easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incision, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of the incision is, that the phlebotomist should first make a weak incision in the cephalic vein, and draw from it blood according to the measure of his strength.
Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near his fat in the depressed area there: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instruments are possible for you.
Then close the incision quickly, and care for it until it heals.
If the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
If however it does not yield to you for extraction, then take a thin, slender spatula, according to this shape.
And administer it with that to cut out that kind of grain that falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think that the grain has already been moistened by the ear's vapor, until you place it into many fragments; then extract them with hooks, or with a fine syringe, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction is thus relieved.
However, for water that enters the ear, the afflicted person should use sneezing with condiments first, and now fill his ear with some old cotton; and he is lying on that ear, in which the water is.
If therefore it emerges through that, it is good.
And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them with fire for a little while, and let the afflicted person insert one of them into the opening of his ear; and let him jump on his foot on that side, and strike with another stone against the stone that is in the ear.
Therefore, let him not cease doing that with stone and stone until all the water emerges.
And now water emerges such that you take one from papyrus, or from reed, and insert one end of it into the ear; and light the other end with fire, until most of it is burned.
Then again another reed, and do this many times, until all the water emerges; and extract it with a cannula according to what was previously stated concerning the stone.
In extracting an animal that has entered it, if it is of small body, like a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, that appears to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all things held within the ear.
In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary to look at the ear in the sun.
If therefore anything of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
If, however, nothing appears there, then take a cannula, whose form is this, narrow below, wide above; and insert the slender end into the ear according to the quantity that the infirm patient tolerates; then suck with a strong suction.
Do this many times, until all the worms emerge.
If, however, they do not yield to you for exit, then coat the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the section on the stone.
If, however, they do not emerge with what we have said, then administer the distillations which the ancients have already experienced in the destruction of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your application of oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
As you see, make it from silver, or bronze, narrowed at the bottom, in which there is a small opening, wider above.
Let the part that pushes, which is in the concavity of the cannula, be made of bronze, properly fashioned.
And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap a bit of cloth around its end in a neat wrapping; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you wish from these, into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then insert the rod with the cloth on top, and express it with a moderate pressure of your hand, until the oil is pushed into the concavity of the ear, and the sick person feels it inwardly; and that which is poured into the ear should already be warmed with fire for a short time; and beware that the thing which is distilled into it is not very cold; for the medicines do not tolerate that.
On the treatment of sudden ear blockage.
Chapter 7.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And sometimes blockage in the ear canal occurs in people from a wound, or flesh growing in it.
And this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the ear cavity, not followed by sight; and sometimes it occurs near the outer part of the cavity, and sight follows it.
Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which sight does not encompass, is in many cases difficult to cure.
And in that which is followed by sight, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look at it. Then, if you see the blockage appearing, open it with a thin probe, whose form is as follows:  its end should have a small width, part of which is pointed, and the rest of the probe should be smooth on both sides, so as not to injure the ear.
If, therefore, the blockage is from flesh grown in the ear canal, then grasp it with a fine hook and cut it with forceful ease until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth rod, and warm it a little with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
If, therefore, you sense a blockage, with the patient experiencing difficulty hearing, attempt to open it with care, and be careful not to injure the ear's nerves.
Then place a bandage in the ear, according to the size of the opening, having wrapped it in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days, until you are sure of the wound's healing.
Or take a bandage, soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle powdered zigi on it, and use it.
If you see that the ear is already suppurating, then you should remove the bandage, and replace it with another bandage wrapped in a cloth made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides; then treat it until it heals.
If, however, a bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear; and use the rest of the treatment, which cuts off the bleeding as described in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of the eyelid's ailment.
Chapter VIII. These ailments of the eyelids, which occur in the eye, are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you should grasp them with forceps or a hook, and cut them off with a spatula from their roots.
Then place powdered zegi over the affected area.
If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lenticular cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
For they often return when something remains from their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of granulations of the eyelids of the eye.
Chapter IX.
Often something occurs in the eyelids that resembles granulation in its strength and hardness, and because of this is called Granulation: and it is a collection of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore the operation in them is, that you consider then, if it is Granulation proceeding in that which appears of the eyelid, and they move to every part, and its removal is easy.
Therefore make a cut across it, along its width.
Then scrape it from every side with ease, until it comes out.
Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
However, if its removal is not prepared for you unless after you pierce the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the sick person in some way.
If the cut is large, then stitch it together and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it and makes it flesh again.
And if the swelling is sloping inwards towards the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid and suspend the swelling with a hook; besides which, you will need an incision and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is extended by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the swelling with salty water, and care for the place with what heals, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the swelling of the eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid; it mostly occurs in children.  It weighs down their eyes, and they experience morning colds, and cannot look at sunlight, because tears rush to them, and because of this you see them always lying on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids, beneath their eyebrows, are wet, already covered by the swelling.  The prominence of the Axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the method of its operation is that the sick person should place their head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare bandages on it, and make a circle from that bandage according to the amount that Axirnath contains on all sides.
Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Then find the middle of that moisture with a lancet, making incisions across its width, and do not make a larger incision than that which is made in phlebotomy in the depth.
Or it is necessary to cut through the entire skin until you reach the Axirnath, for in many arrangements the Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Therefore, extract it with the cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers on the outside; and you shall turn your hand to the right and to the left, until it is dispersed; and be careful not to add to the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet and injure it.
If, however, Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you shall add a little to the incision with ease, until Axirnath proceeds.
Then extract it, as we have said.
Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with bandages.
And there are men who grind salt, and place it in the concavity of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture will liquefy.
Then treat it until it heals.
If however a hot abscess occurs in the area, then treat it with soothing plasters, until it heals.
Concerning the methods for Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, causing it to wrinkle improperly.
Chapter XI.
When extra hairs grow in the eyelids, beyond the natural hairs, and grow old, they harm the eye and cause various illnesses, such as frequent tears, eyelid softening, and clouding, until it becomes the cause of the eye's destruction.
And indeed, Ataxmir of the eye is treated according to four methods. Or by cauterization with fire.
Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cauteries.
Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suture.
Or by tubes, according to what I will say.
You should place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it turns, it is good.
And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and cause the needle with the thread to penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow; and pull the thread upward with the eyelid, and turn it with a lever.
Then find in the inner part of the eyelid beneath the hairs, with the spatula running from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then withdraw the thread, and place a small cushion of cotton, or cloth, beneath the eyelid; then mark on the eyelid with ink, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that it be shaped according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since it is already diverse in humans.
For among them is one who needs a large portion of the eyelid to be cut away, according to the amount that is softened by the eyelid. Then, with the spatula, find along the two lines you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the fissure be close to the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a ray.
Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then scrape it all away. Then bring together the two edges with a suture, using a needle and fine wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and cause whatever excess thread remains over the two eyebrows to adhere with certain incanescent substances, if you wish to do so; and if not, do not bother.
Then leave the suture and threads for up to three or four days; afterwards, treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and treat it with that which dries and contracts it.
For the eyelid is raised at the sealing and bringing together of the wound: but it will be better.
These methods of treatment the ancients taught to Ataxmir.
However, there is care for the sick person in it, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure, which should be like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate or combined hooks, according to this following form, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equal cutting.
If, however, it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Then raise your hand with equal elevation; and raise the skin over which the sign is marked, as we have narrated.
Then join the two edges of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it heals.
If, however, an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with cauterium, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that its hairs are turned.
Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
And it is, that you turn the eyelid, and cut the fissure that is within, according to what I have recounted.
Then make two reeds, or two thin sticks, whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of the spatula; and you have already cut at the ends of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully attach each to that which is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and bind the two reeds from both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for a few days. For the tightened skin will die and become black and putrefy, until it falls away by itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Then care for it until it heals.
When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two tubes, which you shall make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
Concerning the raising of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The operation in it is that you should take a thin needle, and introduce into it a thin, smooth silk thread. Then tie its ends, and make a very small knot on each end: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place another thin thread under it in the Alinxotati, and tie its ends if you wish.
Then let the sick person place their head in your lap, and be near the sun so that the operation is revealed; for it is a subtle or minute operation.
Then introduce the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate into the eyelid quickly, until you pull it out over the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up over the alinxotati: and introduce that hair into the alinxotati; if there is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the alinxotati into the eyelid with the natural hair.
However, if the alinxotati is pulled out, and the hair does not emerge with it: you will pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread that you have placed in it, until the alinxotati emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with your eye's vision. Then you will pull the alinxotati and the thread: and remove both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and lift it with it: or leave it until it lengthens after a time, and then lift it.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Therefore, the accidental one arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and similar things to them.
And the method of treatment in it is that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its edges, and place in what is between them a linen pad, and bind it, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things that dry and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: indeed, use in it things that soften, such as Greek hay; and embrocate with water in which althea, flaxseed have been cooked; and with the unguent dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some of the oils; and wrap it with the linen pad, and treat it with that.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you should strive with all your ingenuity so that it is not consolidated according to the form it was in at first.
And this operation, which we have described, is only a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the shape of the place does not return to what it was entirely. Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati, which occurs in the lower part, is truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental one results from a wound, or a fissure, or a cauterization, and similar things.
And the method of operation in it is to take a needle, in which there is a doubled thread, and to dip it into the flesh, and to make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches in two extremities of flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a radius, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and split two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and a corner is made from them: until when they are aggregated the shape of them becomes this shape, and it is the letter lambda Greek.
Then remove that flesh by the quantity that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Then join the separated parts: sew it with a wool thread.
Then treat them with what we have said, of softening medicines, and with bandages, until they are healed.
And if an Alxatrati occurs from a fissure, and a suture, or cauterization: then it is necessary that you split a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we have said.
And the sum of the discourse on treating Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the Alxatrati.
For it is itself of many varieties in form: and a skillful craftsman prepares his ingenuity with whatever means is possible to him, until he restores the figure to its natural form, or nearly so, and the infirm one himself, according to what is suitable for him from the operation and instruments in various arrangements.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and hinders it from its natural functions.
Therefore, you should introduce the tip of the probe under the eyelid, and lift it upward; or extend it with a hook. Then, cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp, but rather slightly blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed and does not injure the eye with its sharpness.  Your incision should be like scraping off that adhesion with ease, until the eyelid returns to its natural form and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then, pour salty water into the eye, washing it with water; or distil it into it, from a sieve made of dissolved zinc with water.
Then separate the eyelid and the eye with linen thread. Place wool soaked with egg white over the eye. After three days, use a sieve and consolidants until healed.
Concerning the incision of the toenail and the prominence of the tear ducts.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the toenail is according to two ways. Or it is nervous and is similar to hard, fine leather.
Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which, when touched with iron, or you try to take it with a hook, is cut, and the hook does not fix itself to it.
And both kinds do not begin, unless from the larger tear duct, until it gradually proceeds until it covers the sight, and hinders light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operation in its incision is: that the sick person place their head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand.
Then collect the nail with a hook of little duplication, and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hair of a horse, or ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the tip of the needle a little, and fasten it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape the side of the nail that follows the pupil with the hair, as if you were sawing it with the hair until its end.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a small spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear duct flesh, so that a continuous flow of tears does not result from its incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, or with a thread, as we said.
Then scrape with a gentle spatula, whose shape is this.
And be careful that the spatula does not touch the horny membrane, and a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is pierced.
Then after the incision, apply some crushed salt to the eye, or a preparation made from ziniar, and leave it until the next day.
Then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed. If the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is often treated with medicines and healed as I have described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the sick person's eye and take a fine, gentle, weakly sharpened spatula, according to this form.
And scrape the nail from above with care.
If you see that it becomes thin and breaks, and the scraping is imprinted on it, then distil from your hour into the eye a sief made from ziniar, or from red sief, or crushed salt; and plug the eye until another day.
Then repeat the operation upon it until the whole of it is removed.
Unless there be a hot abscess in the eye, in which case you should leave it and treat the abscess until it is healed. Then repeat the operation upon it with scraping until it is healed.
However, if a fleshy prominence of the tear duct causes great harm to the eye, suspend it with a hook and cut away a portion of it; and do not make the incision too deep, so that the flow of tears is not interrupted.
Then instill into the tear duct a red, or prepared, ziniari, until healed. Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh grown in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes in some people's eyes, red flesh grows, either compounded or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or presses against the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a rose-hip.
And the treatment in it is also that the sick person should put his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and collect that entire flesh with suitable hooks for it: and hold it with a single forceps, or tweezers.
Then cut the flesh first, until all of it is finished with the scalpel.
And be cautious of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, with which you cut it, be either with a scalpel, as we described in the incision of the hoof, or with small scissors, with which the asebel is collected, according to the form it will take after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is complete, and the entire alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or distill into it red powder, and similar things from corrosive medicines: and place over the eye externally a poultice with the white of an egg, so that it is secured from a hot abscess.
If anything of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat it with that which soothes the abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it again until it is healed.
And do likewise with added flesh that occurs in the eye of this kind.
However, it is necessary that you avoid treating any weak eye by natural means, or by accidental means, operating with iron: and do not insert your hand into any of these operations, until you see that the member is tolerant of that operation.
Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII. Sebel are red veins that are woven over the eye, and prevent the sight from performing its function; and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which there is Sebel is strong, and there is no other illness in it besides Sebel; then collect the Sebel from it.
And it is so that you instruct the sick person to place their head in your lap.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment; and let the hook be a thin double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graduated on one body, according to this form.
Then collect those veins with small scissors with delicacy, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and they dissolve; and beware that you do not injure the eye with the ends of the scissors.
And let your operation be in the midday sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not injure anything but those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye green or red sief, so that its sharpness corrodes what remains of the scab.
If however it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the eye's pain, and leave it for a few days, until its pain is calmed; and secure it from a hot abscess; then again treat it according to the same method, until it is healed.
And this is the form of the scissors.
Concerning the reduction of the arissatum to the nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call the Arissatum a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a burning sharp medicine, according to its previous description.
And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it; unless you should cut open the abscess near its origin and extract all the moisture and pus within it until the bone is exposed.
When, therefore, the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness upon it, then scrape it with an instrument of this form.
And it is called an Asperi head.
Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like a azir, which shall be pointed by filing or by a fine aliskilferi point, and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone. Then revolve it between your fingers, and you should press your hand a little while, until you know that the corruption has been scraped off; and do this several times.
Then revolve it between your fingers, and you should press your hand a little while, until you know that the corruption has been scraped off; and do this several times. Then restore the place with drying, astringent medicines.
If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh arises in it, and the course of pus is cut off; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not become an abscess, and no accident happens in it; then know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no remedy for it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
And it is, that you expose the second bone with an iron instrument, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill according to this form, let its iron extremity be triangular; and let its wood be a tapered pyramid down to the tip, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct; and move your hand slightly away from the eye.
Then revolve your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it; through this, that he finds air coming out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore, then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh arises, and the place hardens, then the matter which was discharged to the exterior returns to the nose; therefore it is lighter for the patient.
Concerning the reduction of the prominent eye. Chapter XX.
When the eye protrudes completely, and no damage or impairment occurs to the sight, then it is necessary to loosen the patient, then bleed him, afterward apply cupping to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then apply a liniment to the eye made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Then bind the eye from above over the plaster with many bandages.
And the manner of the bandages is this: that you take many soft cloths, and each cloth is doubled four times; make many of them; then place them one over the other, according to the quantity needed for the eye; then bind them with a hard cloth with strong constriction.
And again apply cupping with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping instruments, and leave the eye bound day and night.
However, if the bandage softens again, then it is necessary to bind it tightly; then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we have said.
If therefore you see the eye has returned to the state of the uvea tunic, it is good; and if not, then again apply the plaster, bandages, constriction, and cupping, until it is healed.
Of the incision of the uvea tunic.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the uvea tunic, and then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a uvea grain, and disfigures the human form because of it, and one wants to cut it: then the operation on it is as I describe: and it is that you introduce a needle into the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part.
Then introduce another needle, on which is a double thread, from the tear duct side, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea in the circuit of the needle; and tighten it very much.
Then pull out the needle, and place on the eye wool steeped in the white of an egg; and leave it, until the thread falls with the uvea.
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the uvea is tightened from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds great prominence.
Then it is pierced with a fine spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the white moisture runs out, and the eye sinks in, and enters immediately; then tighten it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Chapter XXII.
This disease, called Alcomnat, is nothing but pus that collects in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not itself.
And the method of treatment in it is to have the sick person sit on a prepared seat, or stand upright.
Then take his head in your hands at two points, and move it until you see the pus reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Then let it be fixed, and do not let it descend, and let the light be released; and let the sick person see things as he used to; and if it did not descend lower, know that it is water.
If however, the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a thin spatula, and with it make a small incision over the corneal membrane near the junction of the conjunctiva and the cornea, at the limbus, until the pus comes out.
When it comes out, then instill warm water in which you have mixed honey into the eye; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already discussed the types of water in division, and what is suitable for piercing, the speech declaring and explaining; then take that same [substance] according to the health.
Then it is necessary that you make the weak person sit between your hands in a square shape, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye, and tightly bind it; then, with your right hand, if the eye in which the water is, is the left eye, or with your left hand, if it is the right eye, you should press the eyelid of his eye.
Then take with your right hand a small stone, if the eye is left, or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Then place the tip of the small stone close to the edge of the visible whitish part of the eye, the smaller tear duct; then push the small stone with force and turn your hand with it until it penetrates the white of the eye; and you will feel that the small stone has now reached the empty area.
And it is necessary that the measure of the small stone's path to the depth be the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the edge of the eye.
For you will see them in the very pupil of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the small stone to the place where the water is.
Then press it downward, one time after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that on which he opens his sight immediately, and the small stone in his eye.
Then rest a little.
If therefore the water descends, then put it down the second time, except that the small stone emerges.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the small stone with ease: and you turn your hand gradually. Then dissolve some clear gem salt in water: and wash the eye inside with it.
Then place all the wadding, or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, outside the eye, and bind the healthy eye with it.
We, and those of our time, put crushed cumin with egg white upon it.
If the small stone does not yield to you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from people whose eye is very hard, then it is necessary to take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the shape.
Therefore, scrape with it only the conjunctiva itself, and do not put your hand into the hole: and it is only so that you make a subtle path to the small stone's place.
Then introduce the small stone, according to what we have said.
And at the completion of your work, let a suitable bedroom be prepared for the sick person, in which they sleep on their back in a dark room: and let them be forbidden from all movement, and from coughing: and place their food such as to soothe their nature: and let them not move their head to the right, nor to the left at all.
And let the bandage remain according to its placement until the third day. Then loosen it in that dark room, and test his sight: and make him see things.
Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not appropriate to do this at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision; rather, it is necessary to delay it, because water ascends quickly through forceful vision.
If, however, a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh [day], and treat it with that which calms the abscess, until it is calmed. Then, release the sight itself, and place over his face an oral [application] by which his sight is governed, for a few days, him being in that dark room.
Then let him gradually leave the house and associate with his own people.
And know that in zaltea a student is not excused from observing [or looking at] things at times; then he may dare to do the operation.
And indeed, one of those who are from Alayrach has come to us, who said that a magdan, perforated, was made in Alayrach, into which water is drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the shapes of the species from the magdan, so that whoever is ignorant of them may stand upon them.
Let them be made of proper metal; and let their extremities be triangular with this same thinness, and pointed.
Shapes of the magdan.
Concerning the treatment of flesh born in the nose.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
Sometimes various growths are born in the nose, of which some resemble a scorpion with many feet; and of this is cancerous flesh, stony, of dark color; and of it is that which is soft flesh, not dark in color.
In that therefore which of these flesh is soft, not deceitful, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands facing the ground, and open his nostrils, and thrust a hook into that flesh; then draw it outward, and cut what you have grasped of it with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
If anything remains of it whose removal is not possible, then scrape it with one of the delicate instruments with ease, until nothing remains of it.
If, however, blood overcomes you, or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it what is appropriate; or if it is of malignant abscesses, then hurry in cauterizing it, until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is removed.
Then vinegar, and water, or wine, should be placed in the nose after the incision.
If however the nose opens, and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is now healthy.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it is flesh growing on the upper bones of the nostril, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then it is necessary to insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots on it; and put between each knot a quantity of a finger, or less; and let the infirm person, that he send one extremity of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him, after he has made it similar to azer; and pull his odor, until it reaches the caassum, and emerges upon his throat.
And many times indeed boys in schools do something similar to this Attomi; and it is an easy thing for him who wishes.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which emerges from the nose, and the other which remained in the nose.
Then and with the saw, cut the flesh with the knots that are on the thread. Do that until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread, and put into the nose after cleansing the blood a cloth that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Then place at the end of the matter in the nose a leaden cannula for several days, until it is healed.
If however it needs a treatment that will dry it out, use that.
For performing nasal douching, with which oils and other medicines are instilled into the nose, make it of silver, or bronze; let it be similar to a small lamp, open like a shell; and let its passage be similar.
And if you wish, make it a closed cannula, like a reed.
And the shell of the instrument for nasal douching should be full, uncovered; to which there should be a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish from juices, and fluid substances.
And this is the form of the instrument. Concerning the treatment of nasal warts.
Chapter XXV.
Often a wart arises at the tip of the nose, and grows larger and larger with the days, until its appearance becomes unsightly.
And therefore it is necessary, that you cut it off at the beginning of its appearance, and remove all of it.
Then place upon the area either a cautery or a burning medicine in its stead.
If therefore its incision is delayed until it grows large, then consider, if it is stony, hard, of dark color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron; for it is a cancerous abscess.
For often I have seen that one who incised such an abscess has been visited by great harm.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that incision is possible throughout its entirety, then evacuate the infirmity, and cut it open without fear, without hesitation; and treat the area with that which dries and constricts, until it heals.
Concerning the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little help is afforded in the operation, except in certain people.
Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then, gather the edges of the wound together with stitches, then treat it until it heals.
And if the separation of continuity has already caused the lips to separate, and each part has become sound, then it is necessary to scrape away all the part from its visible skin until it bleeds.
Then gather the two lips together with stitches, and tighten them, and powder the area with powdered dragon's blood and crushed olibanum, and place a piece of diafinicon plaster, and another of the consolidating plasters, over the powders; and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then loosen it, and change the medicine, and leave it until the threads are cut off by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of stitching is to bring the separation of continuity together either with needles, as we described in the stitching of the belly, or to bring the separation together with thread, as I have made you know.
On the extraction of lip nodules.
Chapter XXVII. Many people are often afflicted with hard abscesses resembling herb seeds on the inner parts of their lips; and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn back the lip, and to open a passage over each nodule, and to lift it with a hook, and to cut it off from every side.
Then fill the place after the incision with pounded zegi, until the blood ceases.
Then it should be rinsed with vinegar, and the place where there is astringency should be treated with it, until the wounds are healed.
On the incision of flesh grown on the gum.
Chapter XXVIII. Flesh often grows upon the gum, which the ancients call *abuluss*.
Therefore, you should suspend it with a hook; or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus, or blood, run.
Then place on the affected area ground zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it again and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
Concerning the removal of teeth with iron.
Chapter XXIX.
Sometimes rough, foul, and sometimes darkened, yellowish, or greenish crusts collect on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer sides and between the gums, until the corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become unsightly because of it.
Therefore, you should have the sick person sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth where you see the crusts, and a substance like sand, until nothing remains of them, and do the same with the blackness, greenness, and yellowness, and the others, until they are cleaned.
If therefore that which is in them from the beginning of the scraping is removed, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another, second, and third day, until finally you achieve what you desire.
And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes and many forms, according to how it is prepared for your operation; because the scraper used to scrape the tooth from the bottom is different from the scraper used to scrape between the teeth, according to different shapes.
And have these shapes of scrapers prepared, which you see.
Concerning the extraction of toothache.
Chapter Thirty.
You should treat the tooth from its pain with all skill, and be slow in its eradication.
For there is nothing to replace its function when it is extracted, since it is a subtle substance, until when there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary when the sick person is forced to extract it, that it may be strengthened, and the aching tooth be certified by you.
For often pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in the tooth itself and extracts it; then the pain does not cease until the sick person's tooth is extracted.
For we have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is certified by you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side; then move it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps, at first gently, until you break it.
Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and place the patient's head between your knees; which you have already held well, so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take some of those instruments, and insert it under it from every side with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
If however the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth; and bind it with the tip of a fine radius, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction upon it with forceps.
And it is necessary that you meticulously do the scarification around the gum from every side very much.
And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the sick person from that malice which may be greater pain to him at first.
And beware, lest you do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and boldness in removing it, beyond what we have described.
For they often cause great illnesses in men, which are harder to break, and all or some of its roots remain; or to extract it with certain jawbones, as we have witnessed many times. Then it should be washed after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt. If a flow of blood occurs from the locations (for this often happens), then take some of the zegi and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the zegi is not helpful to you.
The forms of the fine forceps with which the tooth is moved initially should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick, so that they do not double when pressed on the tooth; they should be like the handles of thick things, so that when you tighten them, they do not yield nor double; with short extremities, and made of strong iron or well-made steel, with straight extremities; and on their extremities should be teeth, some of which fit into others, and grip with a suitable, strong constriction.
And sometimes the extremities are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
Concerning the removal of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
Chapter XXXI.
When, during the removal of a tooth, a piece remains, then it is necessary to place a poultice of butter on the site for one or two days, until the area softens.  Then introduce to it forceps, or pliers, whose extremities resemble the beak of a bird called a stork.
This is the shape of the forceps.
Their extremities should be shaped like a file inside, or like an aliskilfegi.
If, therefore, it does not yield to extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary to carefully cut around the root, and expose all the flesh, and insert an instrument called a small lever, whose shape is this.
Let it be short in length, somewhat thick, and not brittle, so that it does not break.
If, therefore, the root comes out with it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments, whose shapes are these.
The shape of the first is triangular with a thickened extremity.
The shape of a triangular, slender extremity.
It is also helped with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this. And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the matter of teeth.
There is also help with this instrument, resembling a large hook, of this form: a triangular, twisted extremity, thickened so it will not break, and not soaked.
And know that instruments for teeth are many; and likewise other instruments are not reckoned, and the skilled craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument, according to which the operation and the sicknesses themselves are signified.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not mention an instrument, due to the diversity of their species.
If, however, a bone breaks from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or it rots, then investigate it in its place with what suits it from the instruments and forceps which I have mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with the gest, whose form is this.
Let there be a gradual thickening in it, so that the bone is grasped or held with it, and does not escape and move, until the bone emerges; and restore the place with suitable medicines to it.
If, however, there is a small rot in the bone, then scrape it of its rot, and treat it until it is healed.
Of the sawing of prominent teeth above others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, a deformed shape results from it; and especially when this happens in women and young girls, namely the ones that are for sale.
For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and is not positioned properly, or if sawing or filing it is not possible, then remove it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it away with this instrument, of which this is the form.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of tempered iron, with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision, by which you cut it, be made over many days, and because of the tooth's hardness, and so that another tooth is not moved.
If however, it is prominent enough for filing, then file it with a file of tempered iron, of this form.
Let it be entirely of tempered iron, and its handle of very small points, like the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved, and falls out; then smooth it, and finally shave it with some razors.
If a tooth is fractured, and the piece injures the tongue: then it must be filed also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made even; and flattened, and does not injure the tongue, nor impair speech.
Of the retention of teeth with gold wires.
Chapter XXXIII.
When the front teeth suffer concussion and displacement from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on what they eat lest it fall out; and you have treated them with astringent remedies, and the treatment has been unsuccessful; then the expedient is that they be bound with gold wire: for silver becomes green, and rots after days; but gold is never changed.
And let the wire be medium in fineness and thickness according to the amount it will take between the teeth.
And the method of retention is this: take a wire, and insert twice its length between two healthy teeth; then weave the two ends of the wire between the loosened teeth, whether one or several, until you reach with the weaving to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Then repeat the weaving back to the part from which you began; and tie your hand with care and skill, until it is entirely firm; and let your tightening of the wire be near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not loosen.
Then cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors; and bring both together, and turn them with a gesture; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it be so tight that it remains in place.
If however it loosens or is cut, tie them with another wire, and it will stay with it for the whole time.
And this is the method for teeth, and the form of retention of two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after being dislodged, and are held as we have described, and remain; and an artisan, prudent and experienced, does not do this.
And sometimes a piece of bone is adapted, and it is made like the shape of a tooth, and placed in the gap, by which the tooth is strengthened and tied, as we said: and it remains, and serves with it for a long time.
Of the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
If there is something of hardness and knotting in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound: then apply a hook to it, and split it across, until you reach the ligament, and the knotting is released.
If a flow of blood occurs, then place pounded zegi on the area. However, if blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a lentil-shaped cautery, which is suitable for it; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed. Concerning the extraction of a Ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue, resembling a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it enlarges to such an extent that it fills the mouth.
If therefore you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, to which the sick person has no feeling: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is inclined towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert a hook into it, and cut it with a thin spatula, and free it from every side.
If blood overcomes you during your operation, then place crushed zegi upon it until the blood is stopped; then return to your operation until you extract it with its fullness.
Then it should be washed with vinegar and salt: and treat it with the rest of the appropriate treatment for it, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then either you will pierce it, or it will burst by itself.
And if it is white in colour, round, and its root is subtle, then it is necessary to cut it.
And the operation upon it is that you consider before its operation, if its abscess has calmed, its heat completed peacefully, or it is diminished by some diminution: then, therefore, make the sick person sit in front of the sun, and let his head be in your bosom: and open his mouth, and let the attendant take in their hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, of which this is the shape. Let it be made of silver, or bronze, which is as subtle as a knife.
Therefore, when you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it, then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as you can, besides pulling with it something from the coverings.
Then cut it with an instrument, of which this is the following form.
It resembles shears; however, its extremities should be curved, so that the opening of each of them is directly opposite the other's sharp point: therefore, take care that it is made of tempered iron or imbued with alfuled.
If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, of which this is the form.
Be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same type of incision.
Then after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If however there occurs a flow of blood, let him gargle with water in which the pomegranates' peels have been boiled: or the myrtle leaves, and similar ones from astringents, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him, until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Therefore, cut those according to what I have said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And indeed I have already treated a woman from an abscess which had arisen between her throat, which was drawing her to blackness, few sensations, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed with a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her eating and drinking water: and she had already come to death if she had remained for one day or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had emitted two branches, until they had emerged above the two nostrils.
Therefore, I hastened and fixed a hook in one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril.
Then I did the same to that which emerged from the other nostril.
Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue; and afterward I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut off a part of it, and only a little blood ran from it: therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then to eat.
Therefore I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times for a long time, and the abscess succeeded the place I was cutting, until it was prolonged excessively, along with it.
Therefore I devised and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore it stood away from the addition; then I walked away from it, and I did not know what God did with it after me.
Concerning the incision of the abscess of the uvula.
Chapter XXXVII.
When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes abscessed, and is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the abscess, which was hot, has settled away from it, and is thin; then it is necessary that you cut it.
And what is collected from it, round, and has no length, and is bloody, or of a brown color, or black, and has no feeling: then it is necessary that you avoid its incision.
For there is fear upon the weak one.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner which I said, from its whiteness and length, you should make the sick person sit facing the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument, of which the account preceded; then fix the hook into the uvula and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments which I said in the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary that you do not cut from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you cut from it more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the incision, use that which we have narrated in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
If, however, the sick person is frightened by the incision, then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear or terror.
And the method of cautery in it is not, except with sharp water; and it is, that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then press his tongue with the instrument that we have said.
Then take from the water that I have said to you in the chapter on cauterization, and make with it quicklime that is not extinguished, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill from it the concavity of this instrument, of which this is the form.
Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be at its end, like the concavity of a spoon's radius.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself; and let the sick person lie on his side, so that saliva may run from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it to his throat and harms him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you should hold it over the uvula for about half an hour, until you see it blackened and the biting of the medicine calmed.
And if you wish to take a cottons swab, and wrap it around the tip of the radius, and infuse the cottons swab with the medicine, and insert the radius with the cottons swab into the cannula from above, until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Do this many times, until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula.
Then leave it; for it dries and falls off after three or four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with a cotton swab soaked in butter, and cleanse whatever is around it of the medicine; and rinse it with cold water.
And be treated externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
This method of treatment is therefore healthier and further from the danger of incision.
And sometimes the uvula is treated with something finer than cauterization and incision; for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Take calamus, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and rue, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and soak them with vinegar, and boil them; and let the pot be well-baked with mud; and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, upon which a concave instrument shall be placed according to this manner.
Let it be made of silver or bronze; and let the end, on which is the pomegranate, be introduced into the sick person's mouth, until the vapor ascends to the uvula over the cannula, until the uvula is greatly darkened.
Then repeat this many times over it, until it dries.
And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's arrival.
For it usually adds to the abscess; and it is not appropriate for you to do it except at the decline of its hot abscess.
If however this instrument is not present for you, then take a tube, and place a piece of egg shell on its end, so that the sick person's mouth is not burned; because the egg shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is from good treatment with health.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract that which is apparent to the sight, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in the sun, and it is made clear to you what is in the throat.
And that which does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the vomit weak before the food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Or let the weak person swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge: and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it.
When therefore it reaches the place where there are spines, or bone, and is extracted, then it comes out. If therefore it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be thicker than a radius a little, and at its extremity let there be a curve, which he should introduce into his throat with ease, and let him have his head raised upward.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, so that coughing does not befall him, and let him expel with it the bone, or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
But that the patient introduce it is better, on account of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing; and let him push it downwards, or pull his hand with the instrument upwards, all of it according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it comes out.
Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
When a leech is medicated with what I have said in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then consider in the throat of the sick person before the sun, or in the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument that I have told you.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine tweezers properly.
If it is not possible with them, then take a concave cannula, and insert it into the throat of the sick person until near the throat; then insert into the concavity of the cannula a heated iron with fire.
Do that many times, and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Then let him take a bowl full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
However, if it does not come out with what we have recounted, then fumigate the sick person with leeches, or with asa with the instrument that I have described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do that many times, because it will fall itself.
And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live prunæ with fire; and the pot is covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole; and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Then project the fumigation, and let the sick person place his mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
For the leech will fall immediately.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water. Therefore, it is necessary that it depart with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon it, visible.
It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat.
And its extremity is similar to the mouth of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and their general care.
Chapter XL.
Abscesses have many species, of many kinds, according to the recollection of them, that is, of one, and of one in this book; and they differ in their perforation and incision in two ways.
One of which is from a species of abscess in itself, and because it is comprised of humors.
And the second mode is because of the locations in which it occurs in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy location is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And of abscesses, some should not be perforated unless after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion; and some of them should be perforated while they are raw and do not mature to completion.
Such as abscesses that are near the joints.
Because when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its duration is prolonged until what is around it rots, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: therefore, it is a more proximate cause of contraction of that limb.
Or it is an abscess near the main limb: because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either it or the main limb through it.
Or it is near the anus, therefore pierce it immaturely; and it is not fitting to perforate a raw abscess, not fully digested, except that which is near the anus, so that it does not rot deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become incurable at its end. You should know the time of perforation of an abscess which is mature according to the fullness: and it is by the cessation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and acuteness of the abscess's head, and the other signs. And it is necessary to make the same perforation in the lower place of the abscess, and of greater prominence; and let the perforation extend in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of tendons, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In those, however, which are reflected, proceed with the perforation according to that limb.
However, when the abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better to leave its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and nastiness, and perhaps its lips will harden, and its depth.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body, where necessary, or according to what the limb requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and a large perforation in large abscesses, or multiple incisions according to the size of the abscess.
And there are abscesses in which the skin must be hollowed out, and incised when it has already become like a rag, and is at its end, so that it is already dead; like what happens in many, such as buboes, and carbuncles.
And some of them are incised with a three-angled incision.
And some of them are incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like a groin abscess.
And among them are some in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are given, and similar incisions to them.
But that which does not have a head, such as mild superficial abscesses, should be pierced with a superficial or simply flat perforation.
And when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, you should not hurry and remove all the pus at that time; rather, remove a part of it.
Then, cover the abscess until another day.
Then remove some more of the pus.
Do this repeatedly in stages, until it exits; especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an aged invalid, for the animal spirit is often resolved by the expulsion of the pus, and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not notice.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary to cleanse the wound and consider it.
If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply bandages of linen or old cloth.
And if the abscess is large, and the perforations are many, then it is necessary to insert a bandage into every fissure until they meet.
And if in the abscess you have cut away part of the skin, or hollowed it out in the surrounding area: then it is necessary to fill it with old cloth, or as when a cloth is woven, or the fluff of linen is shaved off without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with whatever ointment is appropriate, until it is healed.
If, however, bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after soaking a cloth in them: and place it repeatedly over the bleeding site.
If, however, the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places in this book of ours, and in detail.
If, however, it is wintertime, and the site of the abscess is close to many nerves: then it is necessary to soak pledgets with warm wine and oil, and place them over the area.
And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy: then it is necessary to place pledgets soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and altogether cold.
Until when it will be the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary to open the abscess and cleanse it, and apply the appropriate treatment until it is healed.
This, therefore, is what is necessary from the knowledge of treating abscesses universally.
Following the path of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how there is a way to cure it in a chapter, individually.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur in the scalp.
Chapter XLI.
Small abscesses occur in the scalp, and they are of the kind of nodules, which are contained by coverings that are like sacs; as if they were the eggs of a hen.
And their varieties are many.
Some are fatty; and some contain moisture like mud; and some contain moisture like fritters and gruel; and similar to these, and some are hard, stony ones.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as their incision does not oppose an artery.
And the procedure in their incision is to probe them with an instrument, whose form will come after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what they contain.
For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial longitudinal incision, according to this form.
And begin with an incision from line b to line g. When the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the cyst that contains it, and do not leave any of it at all.
For it often returns if anything remains of it. Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment, if present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode what remained of the cyst. Then repeat over the wound with Egyptian ointment a second, and a third time, and if you need it, until you are sure that nothing remains of the cyst; for then treat the wound with the ointment until it heals.
If the abscess contains a fatty tumor, then cut it in this shape, the incision having the form of a cross; and insert hooks between the two sides of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and exert your skill in extracting the tunic that contains it.
If however the artery resists you, then do what I will tell you later.
And likewise do in an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said. And the incision over a stony abscess is easier, because it has little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head of certain people, in which there is no moisture at all.
Or make a perforation of them always from their lower part, so that the course of pus is relieved downwards.
Then treat it with what is suitable for them from the treatment.
Concerning the incision of tumors on the neck.
Chapter XLII.
Often these abscesses occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins; and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And those which arise from them on the neck, are single, and multiple; and they are generated from one another; and every tumor among them is within its own proper membrane, just as is the case with the knots and abscesses of the head, as we have described.
And the types of these tumors are numerous.
And some of them are stony; and some of them contain moistures; and some of them are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that one among them which you see to be well-disposed to the touch, whose proximity to the skin color is evident, and which moves in every direction, and is not connected with the neck nerves, nor with the veins, nor with the artery, nor is deep: you should separate it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b, to a line, g, and scrape it from every side; and spread the two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said in the case of head abscesses, and extract it gradually.
And it is a precaution not to cut a vein or a nerve.
And let the scalpel be not very sharp, so that it does not harm your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick person, and you cut what is not necessary.
However, if you cut a vein or an artery, or it prevents you from the operation, then place in the wound ground zegi, or certain powders which cut off blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens; or it begins to putrefy.
For the blood is then cut off.  Therefore, return to your operation, until you complete it.
Then care for it.
If the scab is cut entirely, then it is necessary to bring together the two wound edges and close it immediately, after you see that there is no excess remaining.
However, if you see that excess remains due to the size of the scab, then it is necessary to attempt to cut its root and pull it out, and administer the suture we mentioned.
And whatever humours the scabs contain, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that the place of its maturity is apparent to you, and place the puncture from that which follows below the body, as we said.
Then, after the puncture, apply bandages with ointment, and similar things, to corrode what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound already cleansed: then treat it with a regenerative flesh ointment until it heals.
Concerning the section of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancients said this section in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it, and this is the writing of their words.
However, in those with synocha, the section of the epiglottis should be avoided, as it does not provide benefit due to the weakness of all the veins and lungs.
However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or the two tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, the section of the epiglottis should be used to avoid the harm that comes from suffocation. Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should cut the epiglottis beneath three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small cut across the width, in the space between two circles, so the cut is on the sifac, not on the cartilage.  This place is suitable for the incision because it is devoid of flesh, and blood vessels are distant from it.
If the physician is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Then he should split the skin until he reaches the canal, avoiding any blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should cut the sifac that we have described, and the incision of the canal is shown by the phlegm that flows out of it when it is ruptured, and the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for a time.
When therefore the time of feared suffocation is past, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and stitch them together alone, without cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Says Albucasis.
The summary of this account we have given is not a description, unless when they see that some of these abscesses have already blocked the patient's throat; and the patient is raised above death, and his breath wishes to be severed; they go to cut the epiglottis, so that the patient may breathe over the place of the wound with some respiration, and be saved from death: and for this reason they have prescribed to leave the wound open until the malice of the sickness is consumed, and its malice is for three days, and as much itself; then they prescribed to stitch the wound, and to treat it, until it is healed.
And that which I saw through myself is that a certain maidservant took a knife and inserted it into her throat, and with it cut a part of the lung canal.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning, like the moan of a dead person.
Therefore, I examined the wound, and found blood that had flowed from the small wound.
Therefore, I concluded that she had not cut a vein, nor a tendon; and wind was emerging from the wound.
I hastened, therefore, and treated the wound, until it was healed; and nothing happened to the maidservant except a hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after a few days to her better state of health.
Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
Concerning the incision of a throat hernia.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is very common in women.
And it is according to two modes: either it is natural or it is accidental. In the natural one, certainly, there is no ingenuity.
The accidental one, however, is according to two modes: of which one is similar to fatty nodes.
And the other mode is similar to an abscess that forms from the knotting of an artery.
And in it there is fear, and it is not fitting that presumption be made to it with iron, unless it is small; and you should probe it, and investigate it with an instrument.
If therefore you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not attached to any vein, then cut it, as nodes are cut, and extract it with what it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then explore its entire extent.
Then treat the place with what is appropriate for healing, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision over the types of Nodes.
Chapter XLV. There are many types of nodes, and I have already stated all their types in the division; and it is necessary to explain here the difference between a node and an issue, since it causes doubt. Therefore, when an issue is present, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the superfluity subsides and putrefaction is complete; then fever and heat cease.
However, with a node, there is no heat, no fever, no pain, and it contains those small cysts, which are their own sac, and is according to the color of the body; and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha, and larger and smaller.
And they are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture.
And the colors of the moisture are many, according to what I have said in the division. Therefore, when you reach the treatment of a node, you should examine it and inquire into its form first with an instrument called an Intromissum, as its form will be described in the chapter after this one.
And the method of investigating abscesses and all nodes is that you should take this instrument and insert it into the moistest place that you find in the abscess; and you should slowly rotate your fingers with it, until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Then place your hand, according to the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the Intromissum and consider what comes out in its wake.
If, therefore, running moisture of any color comes out, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said in other abscesses.
And if no moisture comes out in the wake of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty; therefore, cut above it with a cross-shaped incision, according to this form, as I have taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and carefully scrape the skin from all sides; and if possible, keep a kist on it, so that you can extract the healthy part with the Node.
If, however, the kist is broken during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the healthy part—for this often happens—then extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
For if a little or a lot remains of it, the Node returns most often.
If, however, it overcomes you and a little remains, then fill the wound at its completion with certain sharp corrosive powders; and constrict the wound, and place on it whatever is fitting for a hot abscess, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
If therefore the Node is large, then sew its two lips together, and treat it with that which causes it to become flesh. If, however, there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein in opposition, then hurry and fill the place with crushed zegi, and leave it constricted for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the boiling of blood subsides; then return to cutting away what remains of the Node.
Concerning instruments for incision and perforation.
Chapter XLVI.
Among them are the forms of instruments, and there are three kinds.
For among them there is a large one, and among them there is a medium one, and among them there is a small one.
Let them be made of iron, with square ends, well-formed, so that they quickly enter the abscess.
And these are the forms of instruments, and no, that is, perforating ones: and one of them is called a *beris*, that is, a piercer: and they are of three kinds.
For among them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating abscesses, issues, fistulas, and buboes, as well as that which is between the bones in them.
And others are made round, smooth, and gentle, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, made of amber, or bronze, or iron, or silver. And the best of them are those made of amber.
And experience is also made of black lead, which are suitable for testing fistulas, whose concavity has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their gentleness along those reflections.
And they are again of three kinds. Because from them are long, from them middle, and from them short, according to the quantity of the fistula's width and its stricture. The shape of Hooks, and they are of many kinds. Because from them are simple, namely those that have one curvature: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
And from them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And from them are hooks having two curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and from them are hooks having three curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: because from them is large, medium, and small.
Their cutting edges are sharp, the other edges are not sharp: and they are not placed like this, unless so that with them help is given in scraping knots, for fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the sick person may be healed by them, and may find some peace from the burning that he finds in scraping an abscess.
These are Magdas, and they are of three kinds.
They are made of air, and are similar to a Ray, with which alcohol is made: and on the broad end a hidden Spatula point is present: and on it runs inwards and outwards when you wish, as you see.
The shapes of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers during the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The forms of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
They are made of air, or of amber, round, slightly elongated, as you see: and let them be to a fine degree.
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses be present, large and small, so that you can cut off blood with speed when necessary, and then when there is no medicine available to you.
However, do not use them for the cutting of blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except on fleshy areas: such as the calf of the leg, and the thigh, and the calf of the arm, and the nipples, and the belly, and the groin, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes they are made from them other small instruments similar to hazelnuts, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from a phlebotomy site, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
Concerning the care of the nipples of men that resemble the nipples of women.
Chapter XLVII.
Sometimes the nipples of certain men swell at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they resemble the nipples of women: and they remain festering and unsightly.
Therefore, whoever abhors that, must cut above the nipples with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form, from line b to line g. Then scrape away all the fat.
Afterwards, fill the wound with a flesh-forming medicine.
Then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it heals.
However, if the nipple descends and softens because of its size, as happens in women, then it must be cut open on its two upper sides with two crescent-shaped incisions, each one joined to the other at the ends of both, until there is a larger line encompassing a smaller one, according to this form, from line b to line g.  Then scrape the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we said about sutures and powders, what is necessary for treatment, until it heals.
However, if you do not complete the incision that you ought to make, because of the patient's discomfort or due to blood flow, then you must fill the wound with a cloth soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes the remaining fat.
Then treat it until it heals.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess occurring under the nipple.
Chapter XLVIII. These abscesses that occur under the nipple are of the hard Strophulus type, containing cysts, and some contain moisture.
Therefore, those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, following the form from line b to line g.  When all the pus in the abscess is evacuated, then fill it with old lint and leave it until the following day.
Then the lint should be removed, and treated with a suitable ointment until it heals.
If the abscess is of the knotted Strophulus type, then cut over it, as we stated in the section on Strophulus, equally.
If the wound extends to emit pus, then apply a cautery to it, as we have stated in what has gone before.
Of the incision of an abscess occurring due to artery and vein.
Chapter XLIX.
When an artery bursts and the skin over it heals, then often an abscess occurs from this: and similarly it happens to a vein, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to artery and vein are: because, when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, gathered deep in the body: and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound.
And that which is due to the vein is round on the surface of the body.
And a section upon this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and the groin, and the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is also in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Therefore, for that which is from them from the swelling of the artery's opening, make an incision in the skin lengthwise.
Then open the incision with hooks, afterward the Artery: and free it from its sheaths, until it is exposed.
Then insert a needle beneath it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the Artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two Arteries that are in the temples.
Then puncture the place that is between the two ligatures with a lancet, until all the blood within it is discharged, and the abscess is resolved.
Then apply a treatment that produces pus until the ligatures fall off; afterward treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
If it be an abscess due to the incision of a Vein, then you should hold with your hand what you can of the abscess with the skin.
Then introduce a needle beneath the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it, until you extract it from the other side.
Then tie the abscess with a good ligature, according to what I told you in the ligature of a grape, with two ends of the thread at two sides. If however you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then introduce another needle with another thread beneath the entire abscess at the incision of the needle; press, and tie your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until that which is within it comes out; then cut the superfluous skin, and leave that which is tied from it.
Then place upon it the poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Then administer treatment, which is done with bandages and ointments, until it is healed.
Concerning the abscess that arises from the twisting of nerves.
Chapter L.
Just as an abscess occurs in arteries and veins, so too does an abscess occur in nerves: which occurs in them through a blow, or occurs from excessive labor, and similar things; and it happens most frequently in the places of the helpers, or the heel, and in every place where the joints move; and it is a serious abscess. Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain; and when it is squeezed with force, the weak person feels a similar numbness in it.
And it is not a deep-seated, aggregated abscess, but rather under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forward, or in front, nor back to the rear.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be incised with iron.
For perhaps a contraction will result.
However, in that which is in the head or forehead, slit the skin with a scalpel.
If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps, and cut it away from its root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it away: then remove it, and stitch the wound: and care for it until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of an abscess occurring in the belly.
Chapter LI. Some people frequently get, in their bellies and other parts of their bodies, growths called Fungalia, by reason of their similarity to fungi.
Their root is subtle, and their head is large, and their lips are turned inward.
And some of them are small; and some of them become very large.
And indeed I have already seen a man who had two growths in his belly which were more similar to fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, with tiny roots, and their lips turned inward, and they split open, and moisture always flowed from them.
Therefore, I cut them, and found in the weight of one about ten and eight ounces, and in the other about six ounces.  And the operation in cutting them is, that you should consider then, if the diseased part is moist, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with a subtle root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries ready in the fire.
For often much blood is expelled during its section; therefore, hurry if blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
If you see the patient fearful and timid of the incision with iron, then take a thread of lead well-made, and tie the growth with it: using the method we have described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the lead ligature.
Therefore do not cease to tighten the lead, as often as it presses on the growth, until it is severed and falls away by itself without effort.
If however the growth is large in its root, then in its incision there is something of fear and dread; especially that which is in the belly.
However, it is possible to cut half of it.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it until the wound is healed.
And beware lest you presume to cut a boil that is of a dark color, with few sensations, and foul appearance: for it is indeed a cancerous abscess; and I will come with a reminder of Cancer after this.
On the treatment of the navel eminence.
Chapter LII.
The navel eminence arises from many causes.
Or from fissures of the skin that is upon the belly; and from it comes forth a part of the bowels or an intestine, according as happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood which flows from a vein or from an artery, according to what has been said before.
Or from a constriction of wind in it.
If however it is because of a fissure of the skin, and an issue of pus, then its color is similar to the color of the body, and it is soft, without pain, and appears in various locations.
And if it is because of the emergence of an intestine, then its position, with the one that we have described, is of more varied location.
When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it greatly increases at the entrance of the bath, and with great exertion.
If however it is due to moisture, it is soft, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor does it increase.
If however it is because of blood, then with these signs the abscess appears black from the bottom.
If however it is due to generated flesh: then the abscess is severe, large, hard, and fixed in a single quantity.
If however it is due to wind, then its touch is soft. And the operation on it is, that you should then consider, if the prominence of the navel is because of blood of the artery, or vein, or wind: then you ought to refrain from its treatment.
For in it is fear and terror, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses because of the artery and vein.
If the prominence of the navel is because of the intestine, or the zirb: then it is necessary that you order the sick person to hold his breath and stand extended.
Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Afterwards, order him to lie on his back between your hands.
Then surround with a broad spatula the circumference of the navel over the place you marked with ink.
Then extend the middle of the abscess upward with a large hook.
Then tie him around strongly with thread, or with silk cord, a firm ligament: and let the knot of the ligament be tied.
Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligament.
If therefore you find it already grasped by the ligament, then pull out the tied portion, and insert the index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly: and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut away its excess.
If however it is an artery or vein, then surround it greatly.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles, and insert in them two strong threads; and insert the two needles into the circumference you have made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, making them penetrate.
Then tie the abscess in four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the stretched flesh rots: and falls off by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten.
Then treat it with whatever is necessary from the ointments, until it is healed.
If the protuberance of the navel is from flesh there or from moisture, then it is necessary to concavate the abscess, as we said.
And draw out the blood or moisture that you find in it.
Then treat it with that which solidifies the place.
Concerning the treatment of CANCER. Chapter LIII.
For I myself could not cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me who has reached that point.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is to proceed and to release the sick person from the black cholera at times.
Then phlebotomize it if you find it with clear fullness.
Then prepare the sick person with the preparation in which it will be placed with the operation.
Then cast into the Cancer the hooks which are suitable for it.
Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and let the blood run, and do not sever it quickly, rather, press the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with what is possible there from the instruments.
If, however, a contrary effect is made to you by the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery, or vein: then cauterize the vein, until the blood is severed.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Dropsy.
Chapter LIII.
We have already described in the division of the species of Dropsy, and how the collection of water takes place; and the signs of every species, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites alone; and it is not applied with iron to the species of tympanites; nor to the species of hyposarca at all; for that is fatal.
When you have already treated this species of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your treatment has not been successful, then consider.
For if weakness has already resulted in the patient, or there is another illness with him besides dropsy, such as if there is a cough with him, or looseness of the bowels, and things similar to those; then beware that you do not treat him with iron, because there is a fear of it.
If however you see the patient of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone; and he is not a child, nor an old man; then the method of operation in him is that you raise the patient standing between your hands, and a servant behind him will express his belly with his hand, pushing the water towards the lower part of the chest.
Then take a pointed, thorny spatula, according to this form.
Let it be of two pointed parts, long, with sharp extremities like a spatula.
However, let it have some degree of shortness gradually, so that you do not proceed with it in the operation all the way to the intestines and injure him.
Then consider.
For if the generation of dropsy is from the intestines, then it is necessary to extend the incision from the navel by the quantity of three fingers, downward in a straight line above the pubic bone.
If, however, the generation of dropsy is due to disease of the liver, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then the incision should be on the right side; and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side where the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Then perforate the entire skin with an instrument.
Then introduce it into that incision, and raise your hand with a spatula between the skin, and if you do this, as if you are scraping it: and let the amount scraped be the quantity of a fingernail, or approximately that.
Then perforate in this way, until the spatula reaches the empty space: and it is the space of the water.
Then extract it, and introduce into the hole an instrument of this shape.
And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished; on its lower part is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side and one on the other side; and its end is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see; on its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate a moderate amount from the water in an hour.
Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in an hour through the resolution of his animal spirit, or a faint occurs to him which approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the amount of its virtue, and according to what the disposition of the sick person signifies to you from the strength of his pulse, and from his condition.
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Because it is retained immediately due to the skin that holds the opening that is above the sifac: concerning which I have spoken, so that you pierce it according to that manner.
Then again use the instrument on the next day, if you see the sick person tolerating it; and also withdraw a small amount from the water. Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until there remains little of the water.
If, however, you fear for the sick person, and you remove much from the water: then treat him with burial in warm sand, and with much sweat in a bath and the sun, and let him endure thirst; and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed; and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water, according to what I have described previously.
Concerning the treatment of infants born in places where their urinary openings are not perforated.
Chapter LV. When any infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the opening of its urethra is not perforated, or is a narrow opening, or is in the wrong place.
Therefore, it is necessary to assist with its perforation immediately when it is born, using a very thin spatula, according to this form.
Then place a thin leaden nail in the opening, and bind it: and hold it for three days, or four.
When, therefore, it wishes to emit urine, let it be removed, and let it urinate.
Then return it.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine that flows over the place will not allow it to close.
However, he whose opening is constricted is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
However, those in whom the opening is in an improper place are injured.
That is because, in those who are born thus, the opening is at the end of the penis: wherefore they cannot urinate forward until they elevate the penis with their hand upward. Nor is there generation for him, therefore, because the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and it is a very foul disease.
And the method of operation in him is that the sick person be laid on his back.
Then extend his penis with your left hand by forceful extension, and cut the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a sharp blade, or a sharp spatumil; as is the incision of a reed, or as if you were shaving something, so that its middle comes similar to the head of the penis; and so that the opening is in the middle as it ought to be.
And beware of blood flow during your operation.
For that often happens.
Therefore, apply to it what stops the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Concerning Albucasis, what happens in the foreskin and head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter LVI.
These things, according to Albucasis, happen frequently in the penis, and there is a prominence of foul flesh.
And from it there is another that is malignant, and another that is not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook and cut off, until the whole of it is cleansed.
Then place upon it a compress soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it afterward with the ointment Dyafinicon, until it heals.
If it is malignant, of foul color, then one should apply a cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
If the Albather is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and part of it is within the foreskin and part outside, then one should remove the Albather that is inside first, until it consolidates, then treat the outside part; for if you treat both at the same time, the foreskin will not be safe from being perforated.
And similar blackening and corruption also occur in the testicles and foreskin.
Therefore, one should cauterize all that is already blackened and that is about to corrupt, or that is already corrupted.
Then apply a poultice over it afterward with honey that has been mixed with the flour of ground pomegranates' bark and ground, sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If, however, bleeding occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For cautery is a remedy for two conditions at once, namely, for bleeding and for a wound when it becomes corrupted.
If the head of the penis is gnawed away and the whole thing is destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra so that the sick person urinates over it.
However, in the adherence of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adherence does not occur unless the foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon it; and sometimes adherence occurs because of a wound or an abscess, therefore it is necessary to scrape it with a blunt spatula until the ligament is loosened and the head of the penis is freed on all sides.
If it is difficult to discern them exquisitely, then it is necessary to scrape away something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
This is because the foreskin, when it is thin, is perhaps perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has already been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine until it is solidified. Concerning the cleansing of infants and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Chapter LVII.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is performed by our operation, of our own will, and its use is proper to boys, it is necessary that we mark it with a better operation and a gentler path leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is nothing but what we have acquired through experience.
This is because I have found most craftsmen and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors; and the skilled use ligatures with thread and incisions with a nail.
And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and have not found a better cleansing than with scissors and a ligature with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Because the foreskin has two layers; therefore, perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower layer remains; therefore, it is necessary to make an incision to cut the other, and future pain will result.
And with cleansing done by means of alfecati, that is, digital, which the surgeons use, the incision of the male member's extremity is not secured; because perhaps it enters its opening.
In cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron slips out and spoils your operation; and indeed the boy's skin is of short nature, and they are often born in such a way that they do not require cleansing; and I have already seen that.
However, cleansing with shears, and ligature with thread, proved a good test for me; because shears are proportional to the incision; because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportional, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and a similar figure of compression is made, enclosing the skin of the penis on all sides, with which no error falls at all.
And the proper method of operation is that you should cause the boy, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, to be aware that you are not doing anything except tying a thread on his penis; and leave him until another day.
Then cause him to rejoice and be joyful in every way possible to you, from that which he receives with his understanding.
Then insert your hand into his penis, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis emerges.
Then cleanse it from the dirt that gathers on it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Afterwards, tie a second ligature slightly below that. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature with good retention, and cut between the two ligatures.
Then lift the skin quickly upward and pull out the head of the rod.
Then let the blood run slowly (for this is better) and place powder on top; and on top of the powder a cloth on which is spread the yolk of a hard-boiled egg in rosewater, mixed with good fresh rose oil; and leave it on top until the following day; and treat it with the remaining treatment until healed.
The form of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Let the two ends be blunt, and let them be meeting; so that a nail's head does not emerge from them; and let the length of the two sharpened parts be the same as the length of the two handles, equally.
An error, however, occurring in cleansing is that perhaps the inner skin is entirely escaped, or a part of it near the incision. Therefore, it is necessary that you extend it from your hour with your fingernail before the inflammation of the place: and cut it according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with a hook and cut it.
However, if three days have passed it, and what is under the rod remains swollen, suppurated: then leave it until the boil settles hot, and carefully remove its covering, and cut it as directed; and be cautious of the head of the rod.
For that will not harm it.
Therefore, treat it with what consolidates wounds from the powders we have described in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut from the skin beyond measure, and extends upward, that will not harm it either.
Therefore treat it with what we said, until it is healed.
Of the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Chapter LVIII.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or newly formed flesh, and similar things to those which we have mentioned in the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is now in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that he be weak, bent over on his knees.
Then let his feet be placed on his back, and let him extend his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and let the weak man strain his breath as much as possible.
Thus, it is forced with the neck of the bladder towards expulsion of the stone to the rear: wherefore the urine is released.
If, however, it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe upon the sick man, then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be fine, smooth, concave like the quill of a bird's feather in thinness, and long in the likeness of one and a half palms; to which let a fine tube be on its head.
And the method of the urine's exit through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie to its end wool, or tow, a good ligature; and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe; and cut with scissors if any superfluity of wool remains, but introduce it into the tube with force, as if to raise it.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg; and make the sick man sit upon a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and its member with moist oils, and olive oil, and lukewarm water.
Then introduce the syringe into the member with ease, until it reaches the root of the member.
Then double it above, from the part of the navel. Then force the syringe within it, until it reaches the Bladder, and let the sick person feel it has now reached the empty place: and this is not done according to this order, unless because the passage, in which it goes, is one in which there is winding.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
For urine will follow the wool.
Then draw it out, and cause the urine to run through the urinary way: and again insert the syringe, and do not cease to do this, until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief. Concerning the quality of bladder irrigation with a Clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
It is indeed deaf, that is, closed.
And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
And the hollow place, in which that which propels it is, should be according to the quantity required to propel it without addition, until when something is drawn with it, the humors are drawn out: and when it is propelled, it expels it to a distance, according to how the clepsydra projects naphtha, that is, Greek fire in naval battles.
Therefore, when the intention is to expel the humors in the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw up with that which propels it to the upper part, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then introduce its end into the tube, as we described in the syringe.
Then propel the moisture with that which propels it, for that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it. A subtle form of clyster with which the bladder is clysterized.
Then introduce a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve. Then join the circle, as a bandage is joined: after you have placed on it that which you wish from the moistures, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
On the extraction of the Stone.
Chapter LX. We have already discussed the species of stone, and its treatment with medicines: and I have explained the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys, and the bladder, and the signs of each: and I have described the stone in which operation with the hand and incision is undertaken: and the stone generated in the bladder is proper: and that which is fixed in the urethra: and I am relating it with clear explanation and abbreviation.
I say, therefore, that a stone generated in the bladder happens most often to children.
And from its signs is that the urine issues from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety: and white sand appears in it, and the weak person rubs his urethra, and suffers with it, and often hangs down. Then it is erected, and the anus issues with it in many of them.
And the cure is easy for children, as long as they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in the elderly.
However, in young people it is intermediate, in that which is between those: and that whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if small, its cure is the opposite.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will remove all the stool that is in their intestines; for it sometimes hinders the discovery of the stone during examination. Then let the sick person be taken up by their feet and shaken and moved downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or jumps from a higher place sometimes.
Then have him sit between your hands, prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the entire bladder is inclined downwards.
Then examine him and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then quickly proceed with incision upon it.
If, however, it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe your index finger with the oil of your left hand, if the sick person is a child, or the middle finger if he is a full-grown youth, and insert it into his anus, and examine for the stone until it lies under your finger, and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outward against the place whose incision you wish, and order a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and order another servant to extend the testicles upward with his right hand, and with his other hand to remove the skin that is beneath the testicles on the side of the place where the incision is.
Then introduce the spatule, cutting, whose form is this.
And cut into that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left hip, and let the incision be upon the stone, and your finger be in the anus, and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision be wide externally and narrow internally, according to the quantity that the exit of the stone from it may not be greater.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone near the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
And know that the stone is one which has angles and edges, wherefore its exit is made difficult by that.
And of it is smooth, similar to a gland, and round, and its exit is made easy.
Therefore, to the one which has angles and edges, add in the fissure.
If it does not emerge thus, then it is necessary that you devise something above it, or that you tie over it with a fitting instrument, whose extremity is like the moon, which shall tie above the stone, and not escape from it; or that you introduce a slender, curved instrument underneath it.
If however you cannot above it, then enlarge the opening a little.
If anything from the blood overcomes you, cut it away with a zegi.
If however the stone is more than one, then drive the large one first to the opening of the bladder.
Then cut above it.
Afterwards drive the small one after that: and likewise do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then ignorance is to cut above it with a large incision.
Because it happens to the sick person one of two things, either that he dies, or that a constant dripping of urine happens to him: because the place is not entirely consolidated.
But administer its expulsion, until it comes out; or make incisions in its fracture with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and compress it, and place over it a cloth steeped in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: as a hot abscess is seated.
Then lay the sick person on their back, and do not loosen the bandage, until the third day.
When you have then loosened it, embrocate the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with diachylon ointment, and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
If however, a hot abscess, added to the wound, and corrosive, and similar to it should occur; such as if blood congeals in the bladder, and prevents urine from leaving; and this is known by the blood's discharge with the urine.
Therefore, insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply every kind of suitable remedy for healing, until it is healed.
And it is necessary during the entire period of treatment, that you tie the two hips together and compress, for the sake of the medicines that are placed over the area.
If the stone is small, and is in the urethra, and it is fixed there, and it prevents the exit of urine, then treat it with what I have described before you reach the stage of cutting.
For many times you will be spared from cutting by this treatment, for I have already proven that. And it is necessary that you take a trocar made of iron, of this form, triangular at the end, sharp, fixed to wood.
Then take a thread, and tie the urethra with it under the stone so it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the piercing iron into the urethra with ease, until the trocar reaches the stone itself; and revolve the trocar with your hand on the stone gradually; and try to pierce it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
For the urine is discharged immediately.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outside of the urethra.
For it breaks itself and emerges with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
However, if this treatment is not prepared for you, due to something that prevents it, then tie a thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone in the urethra itself between the two ligatures.
Then extract it.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
And a ligature of thread below the stone is not necessary, unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and another ligature above, unless so that when the thread is loosened after the stone's expulsion, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound; and for that reason it is necessary for you, when you tie the upper thread, to lift the skin upwards, so that it returns to its position, and covers the wound, as we said.
Concerning the extraction of a stone in women.
Chapter LXI.
Little stone is generated in women.
If however a stone happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is prohibited on account of many methods.
One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin. And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or having husbands.
The third is, because you do not find a woman well knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
If necessity provokes to that, then it is necessary that you accept a female physician, well-knowing: and little is found.
If however you are private with her, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a knowledgeable midwife skilled in women's matters, or a woman who hints at a part of the art in this field: so make her present, and particularly to her, that she do all that you order her concerning the inquiry about the stone. First of all, it is that she should look if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert her finger into her anus, and seek for the stone.
If therefore she finds it, she should constrict it under her finger, and then order the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina of the sick woman, and inquire about the stone, after she places her left hand on the bladder, and compresses it with a good compression. If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her skill, until she reaches it with the root of the thigh.
Then she should cut upon it at the opposition of the middle of the vulva at the root of the thigh, from whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, constricting it underneath: and the incision should be small at first.
Then she should insert a rod over that incision.
If therefore she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone emerges from it.
And know that the species of stone are many. For from these there is a small one, and a large one, smooth and rough, long, and round having branches.
Therefore know its species, so that this may signify to you concerning that which you wish.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add to the place ground zegi, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is severed.
If, however, a flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery which is cut: then place powder on the place, and bind it with bandages of fitting constriction; and do not alter it; and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Perhaps, indeed, the weak woman will die.
Then treat the wound.
When therefore the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place putrefies, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
Concerning the incision of watery hernia.
Chapter LXII.
A watery hernia is not, unless an aggregation of moisture in a white sifac, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and is called sifac. And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature prepared for it in part of the egg, until it is rotten: which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we said: and that does not happen except rarely.
And indeed the generation of this hernia is from the weakness that occurs in the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out upon them.
And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
And this moisture has many colours. For either its color is inclined towards a yellowness, or it is a blood-red, or it is a foul, black, or it is a watery white, and that is what is more.
For if it is in the white sifac that we mentioned, then the abscess is round to a slight length like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from every side.
And if the moisture is in the proper tissue to itself, then the abscess is round with part of an egg, and because of this the man thinks that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under sense.
Therefore, when you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with the inserted square, whose form preceded.
Therefore, according to that which emerges in the track of the Intromiss, judge of that which is between it.
When, therefore, we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you command the sick person to be bled, if it is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then let him be laid on his back upon a slightly raised thing, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit you upon his left side, and command the attendant to sit on his right side, who should extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the navel of the belly.
Then take a wide spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, as far as near the pubic bone; and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sifac containing it; and scrape it and observe it, or beware of this, that you separate it; and let your scraping, with which you scrape it, be from the part that hangs with the egg more; and subtly examine it with the scraping according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then pierce the sifac full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water. Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sifac upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles containing it; and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either with its totality, or in fragments, especially its thin side.
For if you do not thoroughly examine it, there is no security in its incision, that the water will not return.
If, however, the egg proceeds outward from its skin during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the sifac, return it.
Then join the two lips of the scrotal skin with sutures.
Then treat it like the other wounds until it heals.
If you find a corrupted egg with another blackness, then it is necessary to tie the vessels, which are the suspensory ligaments, fearing the flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and remove the egg; afterwards treat it with what we have said.
If, however, water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore, cut the other part according to what you have done to the other equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do it; then wipe away the blood.
And introduce into the sections wool immersed in oil, or in rose oil; and place outside another wool which you have immersed in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the cavity of the belly; and place over it doubled cloths, and these are pillows; and tie them over it with a bandage, which is having six according to this form.
Then take two cloths, and sew them together, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness; and let the edges with which it is pressed be made of cotton, or damp wool; and let them be joined with a constriction at the lumbar region of the breeches; and one of the edges should extend over the anus up to the back, and the second should extend to the side of the pubic area; and two edges over the two thighs below, and two other edges over the two groins, and the whole constriction should be joined at the lumbar region of the breeches.
And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery at the place of the incision with iron: and it is like taking a delicate knife cautery, and cutting with it the skin of the testicles; and it is heated, as we have described; until when a white substance containing water is revealed; then take the cautery, according to this form.
It is similar to the Greek letter.
Then pierce it with that, and let it be heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Then extend the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a heated fine cautery, and cut it as best you can until you eradicate all of it.
And beware, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than an operation with a section.
If, however, a contrary thing happens to you at the time of the section, or at the time of the cautery, a hot abscess, or a flow of blood, or anything else: then it is necessary that you treat whatever contrary thing happens to you from it with the treatment that suits it, as has been previously stated.
If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect this operation because of its horror, then perform the perforation as I describe it; and it is so.
When it is certified to you by what we have said about the signs that the limb is watery, then it is necessary that you have the patient sit upon a raised seat.
Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula; and place the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water runs out.
Then place a poultice on the wound, and bandage it, and let it run until the remaining water is drained; then treat it until the wound heals.
If, however, there is opposition to the escape of water at the time you perforate it, and this is only because a white membrane creates opposition in the wound opening, and prevents the water's exit, then it is necessary to insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of the hydrops is drawn out, whose form has preceded, or add a little to the wound treatment.
And know that the water returns, and collects after six months, or about that time.
When it collects again, then it is to be pierced according to the same method, and the patient will pass their days.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the section concerning this tumor, there is fear leading to harm in many dispositions.
Therefore, it seems to me that its dismissal is to be saved from it.
And I am recalling the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
I say, therefore, that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed: and that happens from many causes, namely. Or from an acute or acrid superfluity, which is poured onto the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it arises from the knotting of the arteries, and their inflation: as its previous mention has already shown: or from the inflation of the veins.
Therefore, what arises from them, from the inflation of the arteries, is recognized by the disposition of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers.
And you should not touch it completely.
However, that which arises from the inflation of the veins does not disperse anything from it upon compression with the fingers. And it is now possible that a section be made upon this type, and upon the other flesh: and it is as if you were to cut the skin of the testicles.
Then, extend the egg upwards, and extract it with a white sifach: and free the suspensory from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from every part of the parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary that you pull the egg, and cut it. And if there is an adhesion between something of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion, and cut it with a round incision.
If however there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that you cut all of it, and extract the egg, as we said. When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose-oil and wine: then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
On the treatment of Ramicis, which is with the Vite.
Chapter LXIII.
Uitis is an abscess enclosed by some wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with a softening of the testicles: and it makes difficult movement and exercise, and walking, for the infirm person.
And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded it's recollection.
But it is necessary, that we say the operation on it according to what the first ones did. Therefore I say that it is necessary to make the infirm person sit on an elevated seat.
Then, with a broad, sharp spatula, make a transverse incision directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then scrape from every side, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Then cut it in the middle, straight along the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from putrid, foul humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of the other wounds, in which pus is generated, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle fall.
For there is no evil through it.
If, however, it happens to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be extracted with the vessels, so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment because of the incision, and it does not waste away or dry up, and there is no benefit with them.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal hernia. Chapter LXV.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles?
And this rupture is either from sifach, or from its extension.
And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a cry, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
And a sign, when it is from the extension of sifach.
It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly; and it is an abscess equal in depth; because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And a sign of it when it is from a section of sifach, because it causes a sudden intense pain from the beginning; and it is a different abscess, appearing under the skin nearby; and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
And sometimes it exits with the intestine in a coil; and this is called a 'intestinal Ramex', and 'zirbia'; and sometimes it occurs with wind.
And sometimes the faeces runs into the intestine and is retained there; and with it is the harm of the sick person, because it causes mild pain, and especially when it is pressed.
And in the treatment of these types of illnesses there is fear with iron; therefore, care must be taken in that case.
And the method of operation is that you should instruct the sick person to reduce the intestine with their hand to the interior concavity of their body, if it yields to the reduction.
Then let him be placed supine on his back between your hands; and raise his legs.
Then extend the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to your need for opening the incision with them; and let the incision be according to the amount, so that it is possible for the egg to exit from it.
Then scrape the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard siphak is revealed on all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and separate with it the adhesion that is on the posterior part of the egg.
Then move the skin of the testicles inwards with your right hand; and with this, extend the white siphak upwards with your left hand; and lift the egg with the siphak towards the incision; and command the servant to extend the egg upwards; and you separate the adhesion, which is behind, upon complete separation.
And search with your fingers, so that there is nothing there of the intestine wrapped in the hard white siphak.
If however you find something of it: then push it towards the lower belly.
Then take a needle, in which there is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads; and insert it at the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision; then cut the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Then arrange some of them over some others with a figure that is in the form of a cross; and tie with them the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligament, until no vessel, which nourishes them, can send anything to them; so that a hot abscess does not occur from it.
And place again a ligament second, distant from the first ligament by less than two fingers.
And after these two ligaments, leave from the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger; and cut the rest entirely along the circumference, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles the incision, from which blood and pus runs, as we have narrated in what has been said before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound; and apply the ligament that we have narrated.
And sometimes the white sifach that we mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
For this often happens.
And leave the ligament until it falls off by itself.
If however its falling is delayed, then it should be soaked with hot water; and place upon it that which we have mentioned, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
Concerning the windy ram.
Chapter LXVI.
In this ram, I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron for its treatment.
And indeed the first ones said that it happens as we have described in the ram that is with the vine.
That is, tie the vessels after the incision, apply pressure on them from below with ease; then cut in the middle, and finally treat with what opens it, until the vessels fall away; and treat the wound, as we said, until it heals.
Of the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Chapter LXVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is little, and returns every hour; but if the condition continues with that time, a fissure is added in the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
And that happens from the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the groin, as we said.
That is, because the scrotum is stretched; then the area softens, and an abscess forms, and it protrudes.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as its previous description stated.
And sometimes it is treated with an iron, according to this method: and it is that the sick person lies on their back between your hands.
Then cut the location of the abscessed and protruding rupture, cutting across its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Then press the scrotum and what is beneath the skin until when the white scrotum is exposed, which is beneath the skin that follows it.
Then take a rod, and place it over the protruding location of the scrotum, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Then sew the two protruding locations above the end of the rod from the scrotum, and connect one of them with the other with sutures: then pull out the end of the rod.
And do not cut the scrotum at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, just as I have made you know in the treatment of intestinal rami. Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
For the scrotum contracts, and no protrusion of the rupture is added.
And a cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter LXVIII.
Often the skin of the testicles in some men softens, because of which the flesh between them softens, and its appearance is disfigured.
Therefore, it is necessary for whoever is asked to treat it, to have the sick man lie on his back, and to cut away all the skin that has softened, over the natural skin. Then, he should bring together the two folds with sutures: and if you wish, first suture the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and make the suture firm.
Then treat the remaining wounds until they heal and the threads fall out.
On Castration.
Chapter LXIX.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law; and because of that, I would be permitted to not mention it in this book of mine.  Its mention is not necessary except for two methods.
One of which is that it should be included in the physician's knowledge when questioned about it, and so that he may know the treatment for the one to whom it has happened.
And the other method is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit by it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
Therefore, I say that castration is done according to two methods. Or by attrition.
Or by fissure and section.
In that which is done by attrition, the way of the operation is: that we make the animal sit in hot water, until its testicles are softened and relaxed, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are dissolved and do not appear under touch.
In castration by fissure and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Then treat the wound until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite, two methods.
Chapter LXX.
A hermaphrodite is from males in two ways.
One of them is that there appears in it, in the space that follows, or in the skin of the testicles, in the area between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vagina, in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine flows from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one type, and it is a woman's vagina above the pubic bone, just as small male testicles, protruding outwards; one of which is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of three types, two from men, and one type from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh until their impression is released.
Then treat them with the treatment of the other wounds.
In the second type of men, however, from which urine emerges, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment of it at all.
Concerning the incision of the labia and protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Chapter LXXI.
A swelling may perhaps be added to the natural parts, until its appearance is disfigured and unsightly: and sometimes in some women it is so magnified that it expands like in men, and reaches the point of intercourse.
Therefore, it is necessary to hold the excess swelling with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it; and do not cut too deeply, especially into the deep root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment for wounds until it heals.
However, a flesh that arises in the opening of the womb, until it fills it, and perhaps protrudes outward in the likeness of a tail, and because of that some of the ancients call the illness a tailed illness.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it as we cut the swelling, and treat it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is a non-perforated vulva of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, that the vulva of a woman is not perforated, or is a small opening.
And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from an illness that preceded: and indeed it is made either from added flesh growth, or by a subtle or thick sifach: and it is made either deep within the womb, or on its sides, or at its upper or lower part: and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation.
And its knowledge is made through the observation of the midwife, if an apparent obstruction is nearby.
If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
If however the obstruction is from a subtle sifach, and is near the two lips: then hurry, and break it open.
And it is, that you place pads upon the two lips.
Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread out.
Then extend the two lips with strength, until the subtle sifach is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it over the place: and let the woman apply it every day, so that the place may not be consolidated again.
If however the sifach is thick, dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a spatula wide like a myrtle leaf.
If however the obstruction is from a flesh growth, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and have with you medicines that restrain the flow of blood without causing bruising, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for several days: and apply a linen bandage, then treat the rest with the treatment, until it is healed.
And sometimes there is a birth of other flesh growths in the womb: therefore it must be cut in this way: as long as it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess which is in the womb, should not be opposed by iron at all.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red Bothor in the vulvas of women.
Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorrhoids are indeed the opening of the veins, until much blood flows continuously from them.
When hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil. And I have already spoken about their various types and symptoms.  And I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
I say therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no treatment with iron for them.
However, those of them that are in the orifice of the womb, upon which sense falls, are those that are treated.
Therefore, it is necessary to place the woman in a cool room.
Then, cut the thelil with shears, or with a rough cloth, and sever them from their roots.
Then powder over them, during the flow of blood, from one of the powders of the incisions, without modification; such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar to them.
Then, press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Then place her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
If, therefore, blood is drawn out with it, it is good; and if not, apply cupping glasses to the back and armpits, without incision.
Then take wool, and soak it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, or Pontic wine, and apply it to the place.
When, therefore, the abscess subsides, then treat the place with ointments, until it heals.
Albarth, however, is red, similar to alhaasse heads, and is of a rough appearance.
Therefore, you should cut what appears from it, according to what I said in the thelil equally, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of the exit passage which occurs in the womb.
Chapter LXXIV.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and contusions, and abrasions, that is, herpes, erysipelas, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
And I have already described all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the division: it is necessary to discuss in this treatise the hot abscess which occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses that collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is done with an iron.
Therefore, it is necessary to consider.
If, therefore, the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with its blow, and inflammation, and fever; and you see it reddened; if sensation falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation; and treat it with that which helps in its maturation, until when the sharpness of the occurrences ceases.
Then it is necessary to make the woman sit on a seat that slants two seats, and reclines, or is supported on her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of her abdomen; and let her thighs be spread out, and let her place her arms under her knees, and tie each with a suitable bandage to it.
Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is made.
Whose form comes in those that are afterwards.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix with the radio the depth of the woman's womb; so that it is not that which enters from the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and hurts the weak one.
However, if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary to place cushions over the covering of the depth of the womb; so that the entire entry of the instrument into the depth of the womb may be prevented; and it is necessary that it put the rotation, which runs on the instrument, from the upper side; and that it holds the instrument, and that the minister revolves the rotation until the depth of the womb is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and it is touched by the hand, and it is smooth and soft, then it is necessary to separate it at its head with a wide spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary to place on the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil; or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and place the linen cloth, and extract the section in the depth of the womb.
And place externally over the womb, and over the pubis, clean wool soaked in water in which mulberries have been boiled.
Then be treated after two days with an ointment suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed, so that they are cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which the lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron; indeed, treat it with what we have said in the division.
Doctrines of Midwives, how living embryos should be treated, emerging in a non-natural form.
Chapter 70.
It is necessary for the midwife to know first the form of natural childbirth.
Therefore, from its signs, when you see a woman pressing downwards, desiring to smell the air, and relieved by what is upon her concerning childbirth, and the exit of the embryo is hastened: then know that this childbirth is according to a natural form, and its exit is over her head, and the afterbirth with it: or hanging, or dependent from the navel. Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be pressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
However, whatever is beyond this childbirth is unnatural, blameworthy.
For sometimes the fetus emerges upon its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet and hand together, or one foot; or its head and hand emerge; or the abdomen emerges; and perhaps it is turned upon its neck, and similar figures are blameworthy.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, astute in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception; and I am showing every figure among them, and how its nature is in it, and what is signified by it, and what should be done about it.
When the fetus emerges above its head in its natural emergence, and it becomes violent upon the woman, and childbirth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened, then have her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her; and apply vapors to her vulva with decocted fenugreek and with moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and with it split the afterbirth, and cut it with her nail until whatever moisture is in it runs out; and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then command her, after the enema, to compress herself; and make her sneeze with condiments, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
For the fetus will emerge immediately.
If two hands of the fetus emerge first, it is necessary to gently draw them back gradually.
If, however, it does not obey in entering, then place the woman on a seat, and lift her feet up; then shake the seat on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If therefore the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies, then cut them, and extract the rest of the fetus; and tie its hand with a cloth, and extract it with equality; for it will emerge.
The exit of the embryo is above its feet.
When the fetus emerges above its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards, straighten it.
Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
When therefore they emerge up to the hips, then command that it be compressed, and make it sneeze with a condiment; for it will emerge, if God wills.
And if it does not emerge with what we have narrated, then reduce the fetus gradually, until you place it in its natural form.
For it will then emerge with ease.
If it is prevented with all that we have narrated, then take from marsh-mallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum; and pound it all in a mortar with good pounding; then line with it the woman's vulva and the lower part of her abdomen.
Then make her sit in warm water until the hypochondria are relieved.
When therefore you see that her lower parts are now heated, then make her a poultice of myrrh and apply it.
When therefore the poultice has been held for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Then make her sneeze; and pinch her nose and mouth; and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle pressure.
For the foetus will be expelled immediately.
The exit of the foetus, upon the knees and hands.
When it emerges according to this form, then gently insert her hands.
Then the woman will be laid on her back, and her feet hang downwards; and she lie on the bed, and fold her hands.
Then press gently on her abdomen.
Then pull out what is under her feet from the pillows, until it is prepared at the lower part.
If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a forceful motion.
Then press gently on what is above the hypochondria, until the fetus ascends upwards.
Then let her introduce her hands, and gently align the fetus: and instruct the woman to compress, until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus hanging sideways from the hands.
A hand be introduced in the reduction.
If however she cannot reduce it, then raise the woman, and make her walk.
If however she cannot walk, then make her lie down on a bed: and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Then administer the liniment which you prepared from mucilages.
If indeed she receives it (the hand) from childbirth, then make her sit on a seat.
Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and straighten the fetus according to its natural form; and make the woman sneeze, and order her to compress herself, until it emerges.
The exit of the fetus is upon her neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is towards its mother's back.
The midwife ought to hold the fetus's hand, then turn it gradually, and straighten it with ease.
When it is straightened, then place upon its vulva what we have narrated of oil and mucilages.
Then order her to move slowly.
When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and order her to lean to the right side.
Then order her to compress herself, and make her sneeze with condiments.
The exit of the prepared fetus on the side.
When it descends to the opening of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail, until it is evacuated from the moisture.
If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Then push the fetus inward, until you place it as it should be: and order the woman to compress herself several times: for it will emerge through a light exit.
The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three and four are born.
However, that is unusual, and rarely happens.
However, five is a thing beyond nature, and they do not entirely live: and it contains them, however they multiply, with a single afterbirth; and they are separated by a sifach, which distinguishes between them, tied to the navel of each of them.
And sometimes they emerge like a single fetus emerges by natural, easy exit; and they emerge by that praiseworthy exit, as we have narrated. If some of them are difficult at birth, and they reach the unnatural forms that we have mentioned, then treat them as we have narrated; and let the midwife be skillful, and let her do what she does with ease and with slowness, and let her be inventive according to all figures with whatever is prepared for her by leading ingenuity to health.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb; and it has already been verified with me that a woman, while miscarrying, expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
That which was done by the measurement of the glorious sage.
Therefore, all this must be in the knowledge of the Midwife. Perhaps, for it will come to her something like that: therefore let her oppose it with that which is fitting.
Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the division of medicine, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use an operation with the hand, then you should consider.
If therefore the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted with any of the accidents from which her life is feared, then the woman should be laid on a bed, on her back, and her head lowered, and her legs raised; and the attendant should hold her from both sides, or she should be bound to the bed, so that her body is not moved during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils, along with the mucilage of marshmallow, fennel, and flaxseed. Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then let her insert it into the womb with ease.
Then let her seek with it the place where she can fix the hooks from the fetus, and suitable places for it.
Therefore, consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend head-first; then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in the nearby ribs, and under the hypochondria.
If, however, the descent is on its feet, then in its pubis and middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand; and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand; and insert it with her hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places that we have said, until she reaches the empty space.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not be according to straightness alone, but let it be moved in every direction, so that its exit may be eased; as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it is necessary in that which is between it, that the extension be softened.
If a part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so that she may revolve that which is retained with them.
If, therefore, a part of the fetus emerges, then let the hooks be moved to another location which is higher; do this until the entire fetus emerges.
If, therefore, the hand emerges before the other parts, and it is not possible to return it, because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Then pull it out until the whole thing emerges; cut it either at the ankle joint or at the elbow; and thus you should do for the other hand, and for both feet.
If, however, the fetus's head is large, or constriction occurs in its exit, or water has collected in its head, then it is necessary to insert a thorny Spatumile between the fingers, and to split the head with it, and to extract the water; or to break it with the instrument called Almisdac, the form of which is presented with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that follows this one.
Similarly, if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary to separate it with algengematu; or extract it with misdach, as we said.
Then pull the bones with forceps.
If the head emerges and is constricted at the fork, then it should be split until the moisture in the chest is released.
If, however, it is not entangled, nor does it yield to exit, then cut the head into fragments, as much as possible for you.
If the lower belly has an abscess, or is hydrops, then it is necessary to pierce it until moisture runs from it.
If, however, the fetus is over its own feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the birth canal is gentle.
If, however, it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and to split the belly or chest until what is within runs out.
If the other limbs are removed, and the head returns, then let the midwife insert her left hand. If therefore the birth canal is open, then let her insert her hand deep into the uterus, and seek the head with it, and pull it with her fingers until the birth canal: then let her insert one or two hooks into it, and pull it with it.
If, however, the birth canal is constricted due to a hot abscess that occurs in it, then it is not necessary to labor over it, but rather it is necessary to administer the effusion of moist, oily things, and apply plasters; and she should sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to straighten it; then administer what we said regarding a living fetus.
If it is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary that you not leave any of the afterbirth inside at all.
When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about hot abscesses that occur in the uterus.
If a flow of blood occurs, then it should be placed in astringent water, and administer the rest of the treatment.
And I myself have seen a woman in whose belly a dead fetus was; then she became pregnant again over it, afterwards another fetus died also.
Therefore, a long time later, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled until it opened, and it began to discharge pus.
I was therefore summoned for her treatment, and I treated her for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
I therefore placed upon it certain plasters of strong attraction, and bone emerged from the place.
Then a few days passed, and another bone emerged.
I was therefore amazed by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
I therefore thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
I therefore searched the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in her best condition. And she lived thus for a long time, and little pus was discharged from the place.
And I did not firmly establish this as foreign, unless because there is knowledge and assistance in it for the artful physician to administer, with a hand skilled in healing.
Concerning the shapes of the necessary instruments in the extraction of the fetus.
Chapter LXXVII.
Here below is the shape of the Strictorium, by which books are equalized, to which equally there are two pivots at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
However, this pivot ought to be finer than the strictorium, and to be made either from ebony or from boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood is about two fingers, and the edge of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half.  And in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same type of wood, which are already fastened to each, the length of which is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it may open with them when you turn the two pivots.
The shape of the pivot by which the matrix is opened.
Another shape similar to that, finer and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
However, at its extremity there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
When therefore you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, opening that which is between her legs.
Then introduce these two joined additions into the matrix: and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount of opening of the mouth of the matrix you wish, until the midwife does what she wants.
Another form of dizziness, which the ancients called the form of the impelling force by which the fetus is propelled.
The Almisdac form by which the small head is crushed. The form of a hook having one spine.
The form of a hook having two spines.
The form of tongs with saw teeth, with which the fetus' head is crushed.
The form of a spatula having two ends for severing the head.
The form of two spatulas, also broad.
All these instruments are used, and the more their types are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the more rapid and effective his operation is, and the more highly regarded he is among people because of their quantity.
Therefore, do not disregard any instrument, without it being prepared by you.
For their necessity is inexcusable.
Of the extraction of the Secundinae.
Chapter LXXVIII.
When the Secundina is retained at birth, then you ought to instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze with condiments: and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils.
If therefore it emerges by this, it is good.
If not, then take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid: and put into it herbs that open the mother's mouth, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, hyssop, cinnamon wood, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them on the fire.
Then place a reed tube over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end in the mother's mouth: and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the uterus.
Then make her sneeze, as we said.
For the afterbirth will come out with ease.
If, however, it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage. Then let her introduce it into the vagina, and search for the afterbirth with it.
When therefore she has found it, then let her take it and extend it gradually.
If, however, it is attached deep within the womb, then let her introduce her hand, as we have described, until, when she has found the afterbirth, she extracts it gradually and straightly, so that the womb does not fall during the forceful pulling; rather, it must be moved easily to the right and left sides, then the amount of pulling should be increased.
For then it obeys, and is preserved, and escapes from adherence.
If the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with a medicine pot containing herbs.
If, however, it does not emerge with all that we have described, then be careful not to tire yourself in repeating the extraction.
But it is necessary that whatever emerges from it to the mouth of the womb be tied to the woman's hip.
Then give her an enema with the tetrapharmacon ointment.
For it will putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve, and it will emerge.
However, when it putrefies, a bad odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms that frail one.
Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered to it.
Some of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
The shape of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated during the retention of the Secundinae and menses.
Let it be made of glass similar to alembic, or of bronze: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed over the prunas: let her hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and again another.
Concerning the treatment of the Non-perforated Anus.
Chapter LXXIX.
Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which have already been obstructed by a subtle sifac.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that sifac with her finger: and if not, to perforate it with a sharp Spatumili: and let her beware lest her hand touch it.
Then place upon it wool steeped in wine and oil.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If however you fear that it will be obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to relieve itself.
And now, obstruction of the anus also occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut that consolidation, then treat it with what we have said concerning treatment and lead. Concerning the treatment of Fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Chapter Eighty.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are swelling, and thickening that occur near the anus externally, or in the space of one part, and is one fistula, or several.
When therefore that swelling is old, it is opened, and watery white moisture, or thin pus, runs from it.
And sometimes there are penetrating ones from these fistulas.
And some of them are fistulas, when they are penetrating in the space to the bladder and to the urethra.
And some of them are penetrating to the hip joint and to the tailbone.
By which a penetrating fistula to the anus is known, even from a non-penetrating one, is that you introduce your index finger into the anus; and introduce a thin probe into the fistula from air or iron; when there is no winding.
If there is winding in it, then introduce into it a thin lead probe, or a hair from horse hairs, until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
If you do not feel it completely, nor does anything come out of the opening by excretion, nor wind, nor worm as I said: then know that it is not penetrating; therefore hasten to the treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder or to the urinary passage, then its sign is the excretion of urine from it, and the prohibition of it from this so that the place is consolidated with medicines.
If however it is penetrating to the hip joint, or to the hip bone, then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no winding in it to the bone; and the finding of pain in the surrounding part, and that pus emerges from it constantly; and that medicine is of no avail in it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their treatment is labor and vanity to him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed. In that one, however, which is not penetrating, and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I tell you, and I have already tested; and it is that the sick person lies between your hands on his back; and raise his legs above his thighs, and his thighs be inclined to his belly.
Then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is winding in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
If however the sick person feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you introduce your index finger into the anus.
If therefore you feel the probe already to have penetrated itself detected, beyond what you feel between your finger, and between it and the flesh; then therefore know certainly, that it is penetrating: therefore do not labor on it, because there is no cure for it, as we said.
However, they have said that in some people the flesh heals, and from the medication with which he is hoping for help, it is that you heat a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been said before, and you introduce it heated into the fistula until it reaches the anus.
Then repeat it twice, or thrice, until you know that all those added, filtered flesh, which are like bird feather tubes, are now burned.
Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those burned flesh come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
If therefore it heals, it is good.
And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
And if a probe emerges, and does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the probe, or if such a thing occurs: and you see a fistula on the surface following the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed by cutting with the probe that is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the probe's end reaches, and the probe is released and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered flesh, which resemble the hollow of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
If, however, blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation so that you cut those tissues, then it is better and more quickly helpful to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Because cauterization with fire brings together good habits, burning those added tissues, and cutting off the blood, and drying out the moisture.
Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, or crushed herbs, until the place produces pus, and those burnt tissues emerge in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which generate hard flesh: and there are medicines in which there are astringency and drying.
For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear recurrence. If however the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and is extending from bodily excess, then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a tension, and between you and it is a membrane of sifac or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no operation on it, except according to the way of trust and hope.
This is because one of three methods is administered in it: either to cauterize it, as we said, or to dissect it until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert sutures, and healing from nearby.
And do not proceed much with the incision, so that you do not sever the muscle containing the anus, and thus cause an unintended, involuntary bowel exit. Then treat it with what we have said. Perhaps it will be healed; or else, you will lengthen the membrane, and cleanse it after having cut it near the anus, as we said, whether with the probe or with another instrument of a sharp end.
Then cleanse those filtered flesh that are in the incision, until you can with scrutiny.
Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with the incision and the upper opening where it consolidates; and an open fistula will remain in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula, and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle of aleskef, that is, of those preparing hides, according to this form.
And insert into it a thread wrapped with five threads, and approximately that.
Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its concavity.
If therefore it penetrates the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring together the two ends; and tie each, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread penetrates the flesh, tie it tightly, until those flesh which are between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall away; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
For you do not have the ability to do this for fear of hurting it.
Then do with it as we said, until it is healed.
A pointed spatula, with which the fistula is split, whose one curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not harm what is not necessary, as you see.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Chapter Eighty-one.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
For they are either inside the anus, like bags of charcoal or prunes, or like bunches of grapes themselves.
And there are small ones and large ones; and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
And some are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those outside the anus are mostly of little moisture, from which yellow water or a little blood runs with constant flow; and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is to order the sick person to strain, and to express it until it comes out the anus, and the piles appear to you.
Therefore, also suspend them with hooks, or hold them with your fingernail.
Then cut them at their roots.
However, if the hooks do not hold on them, because of their moisture and their softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with wool from a double-layered fleece, and pull them out with your fingers.
Then cut them, and after the incision sprinkle some hot powders over them, so as to stand for them in the place of a cautery.
Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
If the anus does not yield to evacuation, then inject the sick person with an enema containing a small amount of a caustic substance, so that it washes away what is in the anus, and it will yield to evacuation quickly, when the sick person expels it.
If however the piles are external to the anus, then their removal is easy and simple: and it is that you should grasp them with your fingernail, or grasp them with a hook, and cut them off.
Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
And whoever abhors cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture in this manner.
Take a wrapped thread, and insert it into the needle.
Then pull the pile upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and let them be lengthwise: and tighten the pile with a strong constriction.
Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Do that with all the piles, and leave one of them: and do not treat it, so that superfluity of blood may run from it.
Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil, or camphor oil, over the anus, and put it over the anus: and tell the patient to rest.
Then leave it until it falls.
When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of Fissures.
For they often occur from the drying up of feces and from constriction of nature.
When therefore they become hardened, and medicine is ineffective on them, then it is necessary to scrape them with a pointed spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the outer layer which prevents their consolidation is removed.
Then treat them until they consolidate as they should.
If however they do not consolidate, then scrape them again with a more forceful instrument than the first, until they bleed much, and are scraped clean; then treat them until they heal.
Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted almirmar, and of dry athelil and formicae.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what has preceded in its chapter.
From dry athelil, one is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence above the surface of the body.
And frequently they occur in the hands of children.
And its treatment is, that you extend the athelil and cut it; or bind it with a silk thread; or with a thread, until it falls.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been stated with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and thus the inverted athelil are eradicated, and not the non-inverted ones with the instrument which I will name. An ant is also a small, filtered, coarse eminence on the surface of the body, going deep very much; and when cold finds it, a sensation like an ant's bite is felt in it, and it spreads throughout the body; and most of it occurs in the hands.
And its treatment is to take a cannula from a goose's quill, or a strong vulture's feather; and place that cannula over the Ant, until the cannula's circle encompasses its parts.
Then, rotate your hand with the cannula, until you separate what is around the Ant; and place it deep within the flesh, and eradicate the Ant from its root. And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air or iron, according to this form.
Let the cannula's upper part be at a height pulling the deaf wrapped thing, so that its grasp and rotation over the finger are alleviated.
And if you wish, cauterize the Ant according to what was previously stated in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on the cautery.
Concerning the shapes of instruments which are administered for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for loosening the bowels, and for colic.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or of bronze, or of cast brass, or of hammered brass.
And sometimes it is made of these instruments small and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of young children should be small; and whose anuses are weak or painful, so too should their enemas be.
Large enema.
Small enema.
Its tube, that is, the upper head to which the bladder is tied, should be wide in this manner; and it should have a division so that the bladder is tied as you see, and its lower end, which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt, that is, not open, smooth, very much, drawing to thinness; and on one side of it should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker; and let the bladder in which the medicines are placed be from an animal's bladder, or from parchment, which should be in the form of a small asofrat; whose root is one palm.
When therefore the bladder is placed in it, let it be tied at the head of the clyster between two distinguishing constrictions with a strong binding.
Then administer the clyster with it.
And this is the shape of the bladder here depicted, and of the holes. The method of administering the clyster with it is: fill the bladder or vessel with medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is not excessively hot or excessively cold.
Then the sick person should lie on their back, and raise their legs upwards; and place beneath them *inthaan*, that is, a skin upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar substances.
Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Then let the attendant grasp the bladder with both hands simultaneously and express it forcefully until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the intestine. Then withdraw the clyster, and let the sick person raise their legs towards the wall. If the medicine compels him towards death, then let him hold it as long as possible.
And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is more beneficial in the end.
If however you clyster him in illnesses of looseness of the belly, and his outcome is hastened: then clyster him again, until he is cured.
If however there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or sores that cause harm, then let the clyster be very thin, gentle, from the clysters with which children are clystered.
And this should be the form of a thin clyster over which there should be tight skin.
Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already spoken in the division on the treatment of wounds, what was fitting for the book, and I will say here the treatment of them with the hand and with medicines, according to completion.
Therefore, I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which the wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Therefore, the things by which wounds are made are often like the throwing of a stone; or the incision of a sword, or knife; or the striking with a lance, or wood, or arrow; and similar things from many objects.
And wounds which are made according to the places of the body are, such as a wound which falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver; and similar ones from those members.
And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may set forth this reasoning and rule concerning the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because the recollection of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone, consider then, if it is from the throwing of a stone, or similar things, and has only broken the skin; and is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately; and do not delay it; and draw from its blood according to the amount of its strength; if nothing prevents phlebotomy, especially if the blood flowing from the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the sick person avoid repletion, wine, and heavy foods.
If, however, something prohibits lessening the intake of food, then lessen it from food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And if a hot abscess occurs on the wound, apply a poultice soaked in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
If, however, you are certain of the absence of a hot abscess, then if the wound is recent with its own blood, and the air has not altered it, apply the powder I shall describe shortly; and if the air has already altered it, then apply some ointments until it is healed.
If, however, the wound is large, or from a sword cut, and similar things; and its edges do not come together by means of pads, then bring them together with stitches, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly concerning their stitching.
If, however, the wound is now exposed to the bone, and hangs, and its retention is only in a small suspender: then cut it.
Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore the tough flesh in place of the skin, and prescribe for the sick person food in which there is bulk, such as heads and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge, and similar things.
If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the entire putrefied part, and throw it away; then treat it.
If, however, in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate the artery.
If therefore you find it not severed, then sever it with a spatula, or tie it.
If necessity compels when what we have said does not help, then cauterize it, until the blood is stopped.
Method of the flesh-growing powder.
Take one part of olibanum, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: let all be thoroughly ground and sifted: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it, and clots with the blood.
Then bind it tightly from above with bandages, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not fester.
For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment until they are healed.
Concerning wounds of the neck.
Chapter LXXXV.
However, if a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference between it in treatment and a wound of the head when it is simple.
If, however, the nerve of the neck, or artery, has already been cut: then, if it is a nerve, there is no cure for it, except to avoid treatment that causes strong astringency, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Because they harm the nerves and contract them.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of the members.  And let that which is used for treatment be mild, such as lime washed with fresh water infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tuttia, when washed also with fresh water; and the rest of the mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
If, however, the wound is large, then administer sutures; or constrict its edges with strips.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If however the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs within it in the lower part, in which pus has already collected, then pierce it in the more depressed place within it.
If, however, an artery in the wound has been incised, and its blood has begun to flow, then separate, or cut it, and tie it; or cauterize it, if necessity calls for it.
If, however, the larynx has been incised, either in part or entirely, and the trachea has been saved, then stitch together the skin edges over the larynx, and do not touch the larynx itself, rather, straighten it and restore it to its natural form.
Then bind it with a suitable constriction, and leave it for some days.
Then treat it with ointments containing astringents and drying agents, until it is healed.
If, however, the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then probe it: then if there are fragments of bone within it, extract them all, or as many as you can: and leave what cannot be removed until the wound has festered, and its discharge is separated and lessened.
If the wound is recent, then powder it with the powder I have described.
If, however, bone is visible in the wound and it becomes a fistula, then treat it with that which is mentioned in its chapter.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
If therefore wind escapes from the wound, when the sick person gasps from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
If its depth is not great, and it is fresh with its own blood, then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the sick person; but place attracting ointment on it, and loosen it twice a day.
If, however, the ointment is not present to you, then place old wool in the wound's opening, so that it sucks what emerges from it of moistures; and cause the sick person to sleep upon the wound, so that what is gathered there may run.
If, however, three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasm occurs to the sick person, nor bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the rest of his conditions good, then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore, treat him with bandages and other treatment until he is healed.
If, however, his healing is excused, and it always opens again, then know that it has now become a fistula.
Therefore, treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from the incision of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what preceded concerning sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
If, however, it has already made an impression on the bone and chipped pieces from it, then investigate the wound and hasten to remove those fragments, if they are separated.
If, however, they are not separated, then leave them until the wound has become putrid, for their extraction will be easier.
However, for the treatment of other accidental wounds in the remaining limbs, the judgment is that which we have said.
Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their expulsion.
Chapter Eighty-Seven.
A rupture occurring in the belly is great, medium, and small.
From a great one, therefore, sometimes an intestine, or a number of intestines, emerges.
Therefore, their protrusion occurs, and their suture is more violent and difficult.
And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
Therefore it follows that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten their return to their place immediately, because it becomes inflated, opened, and enlarged, hence its entrance becomes difficult.
Therefore, a medium rupture is better, because with it there is no difficult reduction of the intestine, as there is with these two types.
Know that the suture of the belly is according to four methods.
Two common sutures are appropriate for the suture of the belly and for the suture of the remaining wounds of the body; and two other sutures are appropriate specifically for the remaining wounds.
However, they are more appropriate for the suture of the belly; and I will tell you each one with an explanation and a statement. Therefore, I say that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it is difficult to return it, then it is because of one of two methods.
Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we have said, or because there is inflation in the intestine due to the coldness of air.
Therefore, when this is so, it is necessary to warm it, just as one would immerse a sponge or wet cloth in simply lukewarm water.
Or boil it in water with squinancy, and cyperus, and spica, and moisten the intestine with it, until the inflation resolves.
Sometimes, wine with astringency does it, and is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow or marshmallow has been boiled.
For by that its entry is relieved with a small thing.
If however its return is excused after this treatment, then cut a little in the rupture with the instrument by which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when prepared, than the incision; and no compulsion to cut is made after necessity and failure of the instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the slender end not be with the slenderness of a Spatumil, but be somewhat blunter: and it is that which is likened to a caiada, as you see.
Therefore, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible over it; because it is better.
When however the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which the wound is should be higher than the other part.
And so it is necessary that you administer this in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then have a pious attendant present, who holds the entire rupture with his hand, and bring together its edges.
Then uncover from it to the one who follows, a bit after a bit: and this is the manner of a single common suture.
And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles, according to the amount of the wound's width.
Then leave from the extremity of the rupture the amount of a ring finger, that is, of the physician: and fix one needle beyond that into which you insert a thread at the two edges of the skin, with the two edges thus made underneath the skin from the interior, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together two edges of the skin, and the two edges thus made: and four threads are made.
Then tighten with the double thread in the circumference of the needle several times from both sides together, until the two edges of the wound are brought together by a proper joining.
Then leave the thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterwards return it with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Therefore do not cease to do that with the needles which you need, until you complete the tightening of the entire wound.
And the needles should be of medium thickness, neither too fine nor too thick; because very fine needles pierce the flesh too quickly, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin; therefore they should be of medium fineness and thickness.
And it is not appropriate for the needle to be fixed too close to the two edges of the skin, lest the flesh be pierced too quickly and the wound be opened before it is healed, nor should they be drawn out too far with the suture, lest the wound be prevented from healing.
Then trim the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient during their sleep; and place cushions of cloth around them, which hold the needle ends; and leave them until you know that the wound has healed.
And this method of suture with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Because one or two, or approximately that number of needles, are sufficient for their suture.
However, the second common suture is to gather with the suture four edges: two edges of skin, and two edges of the wound in one turn, with a needle in which the thread is wrapped equally in thinness and thickness.
Then, when you have pierced these four edges with the needle, withdraw the needle from the side from which you began, so that the thread is drawn back from the upper part of the wound; so that the suture is like the suture of cloth by which cloths are tightened, and place between each suture a quantity of thickness less than that of a little finger.
However, men know this suture.
And with this suture I healed a wound that had occurred to a man in his abdomen, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound's rupture was greater than one palm: and approximately two palms of the middle intestine had protruded, and there was a rupture in the middle of the abdomen.
Therefore, I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Therefore, the wound was consolidated in a space of approximately fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed; and he lived after that for many years, engaged in his activities.
And the physicians had judged that it would not be healed.
And it was miraculous that I did not treat it with ointment.
Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor any of the medicines, could be found.
Therefore, I placed old linen over the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
I will now describe two proper types of suture, according to the narration of the text.
And it is, that you begin with a pointed suture: and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
When therefore the needle pierces the skin and the muscle running along the length and breadth of the entire body, leave the end of the thread on the side on which you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inside to the outside at the other extremity.
When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in this same extremity in this way from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate to the other end from the inside to the outside; and make it penetrate with your penetration, by which you make it penetrate in the thread end on its side, until it penetrates the whole thing.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the end which is from the thread on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin which it pierced.
Then return it to that skin, and sew the thread end, which is on the other side, with this extremity; and pull it out from the skin that is on its side, and do it once, and another; and do it turn by turn, until you have sewn the whole exterior according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is to sew the skin of the leather workers, as they sew hides, so that you sew the thread at one time from one skin's end, and that you leave it at another time from another side, until you complete it.
The second kind of proper suture, which Galen said.
This account of his words is that you sew it according to the likeness in which some physicians sew them, so that they bring together each part to its fitting counterpart naturally, and apply the thread end to its other end, and the needle end to its other end.
And that is done according to what I tell you.
You should place the needle on the end of the thread nearest you, from the outside, and have it penetrate to the inside in that area alone, and leave the two ends of the thread.
Then turn the needle and have it penetrate from the outside to the inside at both ends of the thread.
Then turn both, also have both penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other ends of the needle, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of stitching is better than common, easy stitching, and is a stitch whose recall precedes.
This is therefore also Galen's statement.
And some said.
The belly stitch is rectified with two needles.
That is, insert one thread into each of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from where it is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the stitching of those who stitch skins equally.
And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly, then its stitching is more difficult than that of the other places of the belly.
However, the judgment of the treatment of a wound is the judgment of the other wounds.
That is, when you seize a fresh wound with its blood, before air alters it, and you reduce the intestine and suture it and adapt it, then place over it the powder of the incarnating agent.
If, however, the air has already altered the wound, then apply to it certain ointments that are present to you, until they cause pus to form: and the threads fall, and the wound is consolidated, as is done with sifac and mirach.
Then treat it as is the treatment of the other wounds, until it is healed.
If, however, the medicines are not present to you, then immediately, from the time it begins to emit pus, apply old cotum, and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
If, however, you fear that the wound will communicate to the principal members in the injury, then it is necessary that you soak soft wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil, and place it around the places that are between the groin and under the armpits.
If, however, he feels pain, or pricks, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then administer an enema to him with astringent, black, lukewarm wine; especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and a penetrating exit has been made to its cavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing; and that which is from the small one, of more difficult healing.
However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and this is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is zirbum, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you equally reduce the intestines.
If, however, it has passed a while, and has already become green or black, then it is necessary to tie it with thread above the place that has become darkened by it, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
For in zirbum are veins and arteries.
Then cut that which is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that the pulling of it may be alleviated upon you, and the extraction of it, in case of zirbum, and the emission of the pus of the wound.
A recollection of the wound that occurred in the Intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some people; because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a lance blow, and the wound was from the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old; and it had become a fistula, and excretion and flatulence came out of it.
Therefore I applied treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until he was healed, and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick person, that a bad accident might befall the sick person in their belly; and no bad accident befell him from that.
And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and copulating, and entered the bath, and was exercised in his daily routines.
And now some of the experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is necessary that it be tied in this manner.
And it is, that you should take ants of large heads.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant of those which have an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.
When therefore it has seized upon them, and contracts its mouth, sever its head, for it will adhere, and will not be loosened.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Then reduce it, and suture the wound.
For those heads remain attached to the intestine, until the intestine is fed, and healed, and no harm occurs to the sick person at all. And now it is possible that the intestine may be tied also with a fine thread: which has been scraped from the intestine of an animal, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
And it is that you take the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and it is scraped a lot.
Then tie to the extremity of it a fine linen thread wrapped around.
Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew with it the intestine.
Then reduce it into the rupture. And this mode of suturing with ants and intestine is not except according to the way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound that is large, broad, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy but subtlety, nor is its healing complete.
Concerning the treatment of Zuchemen and Fistulae.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
Know that every wound, or abscess, when it becomes old and aged, and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and continually discharges pus, and does not close: then it is universally called a Fistula, wherever in the limb it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula, truly, is a filtered, hard, white knotting, with no pain, having the hollowness of a bird's feather; and for that reason some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
And in some hours it is moist, which emits pus.
And perhaps the moisture is cut off in some hours.
And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes scarce; and sometimes thick, and sometimes thin.
And I already stated in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that any ulcer that does not heal, and flesh does not grow in it, is not due to anything other than one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of a lack of blood in the body; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh between it and the edges of the ulcer, preventing the growth of flesh; or because of a large amount of dirt and filth; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the material applied to it is of bad quality; or because the treatment is unsuitable; or because the decay occurring in the region is a form of plague, or due to a specific property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where the digestion of illnesses is difficult, and the natural healing of abscesses is delayed; or because there is a single bone, or a number of bones, in it.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their cures with their medicines, in the division; and it is necessary here to make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by surgical means with the hand.
Therefore, know that fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
For among them are fistulas that reach major veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews, or the intestine, or the bladder, or one of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints of the limbs, such as the hand and foot; and some reach near to the main limb and similar parts.
Therefore, whichever of these fistulas is of this kind, it is from among the illnesses difficult to heal, and it does not receive a cure, and dealing with it is labor and ignorance.
If, however, there is any fistula among them whose depth does not reach these places I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure and wish to attain knowledge of it, then take a probe of air, or iron, if the fistula tends in a straight line, and explore it with that.
If, however, there is twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Because lead, with its gentle nature, is easily bent and follows the twist.
If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe.
Therefore, irrigate one of its openings from among its openings.
For the moisture you irrigate it with, goes towards the other openings, and flows out of them.
Then carefully investigate by what means it is possible for you to ascertain whether there is a bone, or a nerve, and whether the fistula's cavity is distant or near; or whether it is a single fistula with many openings, and stand over all of it with your utmost strength, with your questioning, by which you question the sick person, and the discovery of pain upon compression with your hand over the area, and with similar signs and causes of accidents to the abscess.
When you have thus stood over all that location correctly, then proceed to the treatment with confidence; and it is to consider then whether the fistula is an apparent near one, or in a safe location far from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I have told you; then cut the fistula as previously instructed by my account, and remove what is in it by filtration, and the corrupted flesh, that grows in its opening from the flesh, or ulcers, and the like; and treat it until it is healed.
If however the fistula is of distant depth, and is in a straight line, then it is necessary for you to cut it in depth as much as possible.
Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply bandages wrapped in sharp medicaments, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula you grasped with the iron; do this with it several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes everything remaining in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
If however it does not heal by that, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is a bone, and this is ascertained by you, then seek it out, and cut it out according to what I have told you: if nothing prevents you from doing so, such as a vein, or nerve, or principal limb, as we said.
If therefore a bone is discovered by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it, until all its corruption is removed.
Then treat it with that which causes it to flesh over, until it is healed.
If it does not heal, and emits pus as it was doing: then know, that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore, expose it again, and diligently make its scraping and cleansing with your utmost strength.
Then restore it.
If therefore it heals, it is good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a remote depth of the body, which you have not achieved.
Therefore, you have no skill in it, unless you leave it to nature.
If the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps suitable to it.
If however there are many bones, then skillfully perform the extraction of all of them, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
If however any of the humours oppose you, and there is no fear or error in their incision: then incise those humours and flesh, if there are any there, and free the bones.
If however you lack the preparation to remove the bones from your hour, then place something over the wound which will cause it to putrefy, and leave it until the surrounding flesh and humours putrefy around those bones.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
And constrict the section which you have cut in your operation.
Indeed, place over it, if you fear, a poultice soaked in crushed sulfur mixed with oil; or a poultice soaked in Egyptian unguent, or some other green unguents.
For when those humours putrefy, and the bones separate from them, the removal and extraction of them will be eased.
If, however, there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg or the hip bone, and similar to them, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost scraping, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Then restore the wound.
If, however, the corruption within it is a large part, and corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it all the way to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it is consolidated. And I narrate to you the event which happened to a man in his leg: so that you may place it as an example and aid for your operation.
There was a young man approximately thirty years of age, in whom pain arose in his leg, from a cause which originated within his body, that is, from the interior parts, until the materials reached the leg, and it became a large abscess: and there was no external cause for it.
Therefore, time passed with him and with the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many materials came together with it.
And his treatment was delayed, until his leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: all of which emitted pus and bodily humors.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for approximately two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of the hand among them, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials flowing from those openings with great force: also the entire body of the man was already decaying, and its color was yellow.
Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings: and found that they reached each other from all parts of the leg. Therefore I hastened and cut over one of those openings, until I uncovered a portion of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already corroded and blackened, and decayed, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Therefore, I sawed what was exposed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption, which I cut away and sawed.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and this repetition in its operation, and its section, was not necessary except for the disposition of the patient's weakness, and his scarcity of tolerance, and my fear for him concerning death; because it was happening to him at all hours from the excess of evacuations, evil syncopes.
Therefore, he was healed with complete healing: and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he was restored to his usual disposition: and no harm was caused him in walking at all.
If however a projecting bone in a part of the body is already fractured, then it is necessary to saw it in this manner: and it is as follows: that you take a ligament and tie it to the end of the protruding bone: and instruct someone to pull it upward: and put another thicker wool ligament on the first ligament. Then tie it above the flesh that is under the bone: and pull its end to draw the flesh downwards: and you uncover the flesh above the place you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place wood or a board beneath the bone properly below: for when you do this, it does not prevent the sawing of corrupt flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place for a short time, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone: and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compels a sawing of it in another way. If the bone is corrupted, and is not protruding, but rather its part is continuous with another part, and the corruption is in its middle or on a part of it, then uncover the flesh from all sides completely.
Then place wood below.
Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing continues from the other part: and let the sawing be along the length from the corruption for a short time, as we have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
If however the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no ingenuity in it except abrasion.
If the corruption is in the finger of the hand, or in the toe of the foot: then the matter is very difficult in it.
But it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.
And you should abrade it and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever ingenuity it is rectified for you, when it does not cause you opposition from the vein or nerve.
And know that there are many knives and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity.
Therefore, it is necessary to prepare an instrument suitable for that operation for every type of operation.
And know that these operations show you the type of instrument you need when you have long study with you.
And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testament to the methods of illnesses: for then you will already find within yourself what is suitable for it from the instruments for every illness.
Saw shape.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
This shape of the saw depicted, let it be done properly. Let its upper arch be sharp, made of iron; and its handle of boxwood, and let it be a pyramidally well-made one.
Shape of the razor's joints.
Let the head of this razor be, according to the shape of a star-shaped nail's head; and let its points be according to the shape of the points of an elischetfegi.
And it is not fitting, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it when they are corrupted, or the bone is large and great.
Shape of the larger razor.
Shape of the middle razor.
Shape of the broad razor.
Shape of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Shape of the other, slender razor.
Shape of the other razor with a curved end.
Shape of a small, slender, stretched razor.
Shape of the razor with which bones are cut.
Shape also of a large razor.
This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw: it is shown in many places from the cutting of bones.
Shape of the razor suitable for the cutting of what is perforated from the bones.
Its end is triangular, with sharp extremities.
It is made of Indian [metal].
And similarly, all that we have said should be made from razors, and knives, and saws.
Of the incision of the extremities, and the sawing of the bones.
Chapter LXXXIX.
The extremities putrefy, either from an external cause, or an internal one.
Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and the treatment does not help, and you see the corruption affecting a limb, which nothing repels, then it is necessary that you cut that limb until you reach the corruption, so that it escapes from death or from the greater harm that is from the limb's deficiency.
And a sign that this happens to it is that the limb darkens until it stinks; that fire has burned it, or that it putrefies after the blackness; until that rot is cut away down to what follows that limb, and spreads to the whole body.
Therefore, hurry with its incision, and likewise if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, and the viper, and the adder, and similar ones.
If, therefore, the corruption, or the wound, is in the extremity of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to spread to the rest of the hand.
And similarly, if it happens in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it reaches the upper arm.
And if it invades it, then cut off the arm at the elbow at its joint. If, however, the corruption passes, and you see it around the elbow, then in that is the death of the infirm person.
And to administer beyond that, in terms of treatment, is the measure of skill.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades the toe, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it reaches the sole of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
If, however, it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If, however, the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for releasing it, and leaving the sick person to death.
And the way of cutting or sawing the limb is that you should tighten the ligament below the one you wish to cut, and tighten another ligament above the place.
And let the assistant extend one ligament downwards, and let the assistant extend another ligament upwards.
And you should separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Then it is cut or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloths on all sides, and that the saw does not touch a healthy area; and let an additional injury and a hot abscess befall the sick person.
If, however, an internal bleeding occurs during your work, then cauterize the spot quickly, or place some powders that stop the bleeding upon it.
Then return to your treatment, until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it heals.
And I tell you that it happened to a man in his foot, the same happening that I tell you.
That is because it happened in his foot with a blackness, like a burning that is similar to the burning of fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began the whole foot.
Therefore, the man hastened from himself, after he saw the corruption fall upon the limb with its violence, which he found from its pain and burning: and it fell upon it at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time passed, the same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand. So he came to me, and I tried to recover that superfluity with that which I placed on his hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body: and the superfluity was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger: until the corruption began in his hand.
Therefore, he called me to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping from me on the repulsion of that superfluity: and I also feared for him at the incision of his hand death.
Because the man's strength was over the fall.
Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his own land: and it came to me about him, that he hurried, and cut his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I have not brought forth this account, unless that it be a help concerning that which falls from the kind of this illness: and that it be a signification by which it may be signified, and according to which it may be done.
Concerning the treatment of Sinuses, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Chapter 90.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts, or is perforated, and that which is in it of pus goes out, and a hollow place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is above it is like a cloth which has already become thin: and it does not reach its final stage of corruption, nor does it impinge on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: however, if its space is prolonged until the corruption impinges upon any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
And its treatment is to cut that entire skin as it is rolled back; and especially when it has become thin, and is like a cloth; and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, due to its corruption.
If however you hope that the skin adheres, and that corruption does not result from that final adherence; and if there is thickness of flesh within the skin, then treat it with an enema; and it is necessary to consider the Sinus.
Then, if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor: then irrigate it with an enema containing Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, mixed in a vessel; and boil them over fire until the medicine turns reddish; and it comes to the consistency of honey.
Then take from that what you need; and dissolve it with water and honey, and irrigate the Sinus with it; and tighten its opening, and leave the medicine in it for a period of two hours.
Then extract it with pressure; do this for so many days, until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is irrigated with ash water, when this medicine is not available to you; and it is necessary to take the ash of vine wood, or the ash from holly wood; and pour water over it.
Then strain it, and irrigate with it, until you are confident that the sinus is now cleansed.
If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor ash water, then irrigate it with water and honey, to which a bit of pounded ziniar has been mixed.
Or irrigate it with honey and wine mixed together, because the nature of honey is to cleanse and wash away; and wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus is now removed, then irrigate it with that which causes flesh to grow there.
And you should take a piece of the dyafinicon plaster, and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or irrigate it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have described in my treatise on ointments.
If the opening of the sinus is narrow, so that the clyster tube cannot enter: then widen it a little with an iron instrument; or place in it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in Basil ointment, until it widens.
And similarly, if the opening is too wide, then bring together its lips with sutures, and leave it the size into which the clyster can enter without additions.
And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated upward, then cut it in the lower part of it, so that the pus flows downward; because when pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If you cannot cut the sinus approximately below the desired level, then try to prepare the limb in a manner such that pus flows from it easily, as preparation dictates.
Try to completely prevent any pus from remaining there, and take consolidating medicines that are placed on the mark, suitable for what you desire.
And spread them over a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such a size that it covers the entire sinus.
Then, with scissors, cut a hole in the direction of the sinus opening, slightly larger than the sinus opening.
Then, spread some mild ointments onto another cloth, according to the size of the hole; and place it over the area, positioned some distance from the sinus opening, so that the pus exiting from it may be eased; and do not remove the large cloth, unless after some days, once.
However, the one that is over the sinus opening, this is the one you remove every hour, so that what gathers in it of pus may exit; and so that you may know whether that which runs from it of matter, is much, or little; or digested, or undigested.
And with this, again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain there, or there is no pain, and whether there is an abscess there, or there is no abscess there.
Therefore, when your treatment extends thus, and you see the matter exiting from above the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or approaching adhesion; then, therefore, loosen it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you loosen the wound, then exchange the cloth and renew the ointment. However, if thin matter exits from the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
If, however, undigested pus exits from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If, therefore, the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolonged, then add to the drying of the medicines, but let the physicians ensure that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their virtue, such as the dyafinicon ointment, when superfluity of addition from zegi is added to it.
And from the most recent way of treating it is to take the dyafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle upon it old wine equal in its substance.
Then mix it with that, and use it.
And it performs a similar action to this, when dyafinicon ointment is not present for you, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire.
Then line a cloth over it, and bind it over the sinus; and line with the honey that you boiled until it thickened; and powder spices over it, and place it over the cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes long aristolochia, and roots of the heavenly lily, and the lily itself, and the herb's flour, and centaury are administered in it.
Use them, simple or aggregated, grind them, and sieve them: and powder them over the honey that I mentioned, and use it.
If the sinus's condition is prolonged and it is not cured by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it; or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on other hard members, or ligaments; then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, according to what has been said before. On the treatment of whitlow and a worn nail, and the incision of a swollen finger, and the section.
Chapter XCI.
Whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot, and perhaps arises in the other fingers.
When, therefore, its condition is prolonged and its treatment is neglected, and it becomes an abscess with a hot abscess, or it becomes corrupted and emits pus until it eats away the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor; and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Therefore, when you treat it, according to what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cut away with an iron all the excess that remains of the nail.
Then cauterize the wound after that.
For the cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the projections of the nail are now pressing on the flesh internally, and beginning to prick it and injure it, then it is necessary to place a fine probe under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it upward; and cut the flesh easily, and place on what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines until the whole of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If however decay has already taken hold in the bone, then it is necessary to cut away that bone and extract it; for it will never heal while the corrupted bone remains in it.
If you see corrosion and decay spreading into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to the memory of its description that has been given.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If, however, the nail suffers abrasion or impact, and intense pain occurs in it, then it is necessary to first bleed the afflicted person.
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatule in a transverse section from above, in view.
And take care that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause intense pain to the afflicted person through that, and it will be a cause for the birth of added flesh in the place.
Then treat the place with that which calms the pains.
Indeed, the extra finger that is born in some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps some of them have bone, and perhaps a nail is in it; and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in some of the nodes of the finger.
Therefore, the one that is born in some nodes of the finger does not move; and the one that is born near the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Therefore, the excision of the one that is fleshy among them is easy.
That is, cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
However, the treatment of the one whose origin is in the root of the joint is difficult.
Therefore, abstain from its incision.
In that one, however, which is born on the finger at the last joint, then it is necessary to cut first its flesh with a round incision, down to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suited to it.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And the consolidation which happens to fingers together, happens many times either from the birth of man, that is, is born with him, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Therefore, it is necessary to separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place between them bandages, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate between them, or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the place is consolidated as it should be.
And similarly if consolidation happens between some fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
About the incision of a defect.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
Ulcers are convoluted, large veins, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many parts of the body, and their occurrence is most frequent in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and work, and those who carry burdens.
Therefore, it is necessary that you administer a shaking of the body from the black bile occasionally with a strong shaking.
Then, let the patient be bled from the basilic vein.
However, their treatment with iron is according to two methods.
One of them is that they be cut, and the black blood be extracted.
And the other method is that the vein be lifted, and the whole [blood] be extracted.
However, the incision of it is according to this method.
First, soak the leg in much hot water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Then bind the sick person's leg from the upper part of the thigh, up to the lower part of the knee, with a bandage.
Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then cut the nail downwards, until an amount of blood sufficient and tolerated by the sick person's strength comes out.
Then tie it off; and tell him to abstain from foods that generate black bile; and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are filled, and that harms the sick person.
However, its elevation is according to this method.
Shave the leg of the sick person, if there are many hairs on it.
Then immerse him in a bath; or apply a warm water compress to his leg until it reddens, and the veins bulge; or, if a bath is not available, have him exercise vigorously until the limb warms up.
Then cut the skin in a straight line along the vein: either at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and strip the vein from all sides until it becomes visible; and at the point of its appearance, you will see it turning from red to a blackish hue.
When it therefore emerges from the skin, you see it white, like a string.
Then insert a probe under it until, when raised, it emerges from the skin: suspend it with a blunt, gentle hook.
Then make another incision close to that incision, by three fingers' breadth.
Then strip the skin from above the vein until it appears.
Then raise it with the probes as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if needed.
Then lift it, and cut it itself at the last incision near the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision that is above it.
And do that until you pull it out from the incision that is higher, or above all the incisions, until when the whole of it emerges: then cut it.
However, if it does not obey you in pulling and lifting it, then insert a needle with strong thread doubled, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a rod under it; and revolve your hand to every part until it emerges.
And beware, lest it be cut.
For if it is cut, it becomes difficult for you to lift it very much, and it enters upon the infirm from it a great harm.
When therefore you have pulled it out entirely, then put on the place of the wound wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil; and treat it until it is healed.
If the vine is contracted, having a twisting to which there is an involution to parts, and it is not as we said according to straightness, then it is necessary that you cut over it to every part of its twisting, and the places of its involution.
Then suspend it with hooks, until you raise it entirely; and beware at your cutting over it lest you strike a vein or wound it, for it will become difficult for you to raise or pull it out.
Therefore preserve your prudence.
Form of the Incident by which the Vine is healed.
Form of the Blind Hook.
It does not have a curvature like the other hooks, nor a sharp tip so as not to wound a vein; and it is of a thick, flexible form, smooth. For if it were slender, it would cut a vein by its thinness; indeed, its thickness should be excessive, as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg. Chapter Ninety-three.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot countries, like Al-Andalus and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, few in tenderness, that is, in which neither grass nor trees grow.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as happens within the bodies of snakes and worms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And a sign of the beginning of the outcome of this Vein is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg.
Then the place becomes blistered.
Then the Vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant or animal.
Therefore, when its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary that you wrap a piece of lead around it, whose weight is from one drachma keil, up to two drachmas, and tie it; and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever therefore something emerges from it to the exterior, wrap that in lead, and tie it.
If it extends too far, then cut off a part of it, and wrap the remainder.
And do not cut it off at the root before the whole of it emerges.
Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the area, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it is necessary that it be gently treated and pulled out gradually, until it emerges from its entirety, and nothing of it remains in the body; and from this vein, in some men, there emerges something that is in length five palms and ten.
And it has already come to my attention that it emerged from a man twenty palms in length.
If however it is cut during your time of treatment, then introduce a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long probe, with the body, until all that is within it of material is evacuated; and treat the putrefaction of the area with medicines for several days. Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and many openings occur in it, and a branch emerges from each opening.
Therefore, treat it as we have stated in the division, and with what has been previously mentioned.
Concerning the incision on worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Disease of cattle.
Chapter XCIV.
This disease is called in a certain land among us "the disease of cattle," because it frequently occurs in cattle, and it is a small single worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it moves throughout the body, ascending and descending, and its passage is apparent to the senses from limb to limb, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and exits.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Just as worms and snakes, that is, intestinal worms, and ascarides occur in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice.
Because when it travels within the body, and rises to the head, and reaches a place, then perhaps it bursts open there and exits, and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
Therefore, when one wishes to cure it and extract it, this is not done except by its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Therefore, it is necessary to tie that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong constricting bandage.
Then cut above it, and extract it.
If it has penetrated into the flesh, and you do not find it, then place a cautery with fire upon the spot until it dies.
And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we said. If however you see it having already reached the head near the eye, then bind under it the eyebrow with a good ligature.
Then cut above it, and extract it.
And it is necessary that the sick person use cleansing of their body, with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humors.
And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
Concerning the section upon the illness Nakir.
Chapter XCV.
This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that happens in some limbs, then changes from limb to limb.
And I myself have already seen it, as I tell you.
I was called to a sick woman in some villages.
And she exposed her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's tendon.
And after remaining for one hour, I saw one swelling move with a quiver, as a worm moves, ascending towards her shoulder more swiftly than it could be, like quicksilver running from place to place.
Therefore the pain receded from that place, and settled in the shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it moved around her entire body, as I had seen.
Therefore I was amazed at the speed of its shifting from limb to limb.
And I myself had not previously seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner.
However, I have seen many who find the pain shifting from limb to limb, but I did not see it with my own eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think it is anything other than that because the woman was of those whose bodies are dry and whose veins are detected; hence, this windy movement appears to the senses.
And it is necessary that they not appear in this manner in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, with hidden veins.
When, therefore, you wish to treat it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to you with the eye, as we said, then tighten above it and below it quickly; and cut above it until that compressed windiness comes out; and cauterize the place.
If, however, you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with shaking the body and with what expels winds, and dispel them with foul pills and pills of seraphin, and similar ones.
On the extraction of Arrows.
Chapter XCVI. Arrows are diversified according to their types and according to the places in which they strike the body.
Their diversity is such that some have large points, and small ones, and concave ones, and blunt ones.
And some of them have three angles.
And some of them have tongues.
And some of them have stars.
Those that are according to the members on which they fall are according to two ways.
For either the members are from concave principal members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar things.
Therefore, when it falls into any of these members, and the signs of death appear to you, which I will tell you later, then you should avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death follows it in the one in whom it is, in many dispositions.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and emerges through the covering over the brain, are: since a fierce headache, and scotoma, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of cholera occur from it.
And perhaps blood emerges from the nostrils or ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And white moisture like gruel emerges from the site of the wound.
And from it emerges something like the watery substance of flesh.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not emerge.
The signs of an arrow striking the heart are these: that it is near the left nipple; and that one feels as if it were fixed in a hard substance, not a hollow one.
And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the pulse's movement: and black blood flows from the wound.
And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Know therefore, that death descends undoubtedly.
And the sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels following the neck fester, and the patient's complexion changes.
And he exhales a large, deep breath: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
If the arrow strikes the covering, which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and there is a great gasp with intense pain, with sighing: and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps some undigested food will come forth from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and is fixed in it, something of excrement, or of zirbum, or of an already ruptured intestine, will issue forth from the wound.
Therefore, there is no hope in its treatment, nor in extracting the arrow.
If the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine comes out, and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain is stronger than the weakness: then know that it is mortal.
However, the remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder blade, the arm, the vertebrae of the back, the collarbone, the hip, the leg, and similar limbs are preserved according to various conditions, when the arrow does not strike an artery or a nerve and the arrow is not poisonous.
And I tell you what I have seen of these arrows, so that you may indicate by that your treatment.
Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had struck him in the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I only recovered a small tip of it, with which it adhered to its shaft; and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no harm came to his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is of the kind which has ears.
Therefore, I cut above it between the two guides, and it was already submerged in his throat.
Therefore, I worked with it delicately until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly, and we thought that he would die from it.
After thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut above the arrow and worked on it, and extracted it; and he was healed, and no evil happened to him.
And I saw a man on whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound was consolidated over it.
After seven years, therefore, an arrow emerged in the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman on whom an arrow fell into her belly, and the wound was consolidated over it, and the arrow remained within her; and no change was made in any of her conditions, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, on whose face an arrow had fallen; and the wound was consolidated, and it remained, causing him not much pain; and many similar things to these.
And I extracted an arrow from the king's chief men, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already slightly deviated to the right side; and the arrow was entirely hidden.
Therefore, I was called to treat him after the arrow's impact for up to three days.
Therefore, I found the arrow wound to be very tight.
Therefore, I sought it with a fine probe, and did not feel it; and indeed he found a prick and pain beneath his right ear.
Therefore, I hoped that this prick was from the arrow's tip.
Therefore, I plastered the area with a plaster having attracting and digestive virtue, confident that the area would form an abscess, and that a sign of the arrow would appear for me to cut upon it; and it did not happen that an incident signifying the arrow having reached the area occurred in the place.
Therefore, I applied the plaster to it for many days; and no incident occurred, and the wound meanwhile healed; and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until he felt the arrow one day within his nose.
And he told me that.
Therefore, I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened; and when I probed it, I felt a slender arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine, until the arrowhead appeared to us visibly; and about four months of time passed with him.
Then, after the wound had enlarged, and I was able to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to removal, I did not cease to refine and devise ways upon it until, one day, I began to use carefully crafted forceps, in the manner that their form will appear at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed, the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Therefore, I restored it, and the wound consolidated, and the weak man was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
And I relate to you the quality of extracting certain arrows, so that you may place it as a rule and meaning upon that which I did not say.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed by the narrative, nor does that book encompass it, and a skillful craftsman compares the little with the much, and the present with the absent; and finds a new operation and a new instrument from the descent of foreign matters of this art when they occur.
Therefore, I say that arrows do not emerge from the members to which they are affixed, except in two ways. Or by traction from the place from which it entered.
Or by the contrary of the other part.
And that which emerges from whence it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and it is pulled, and emerges.
If it does not yield to emergence at the hour in which it strikes, then it is necessary that you leave it for several days, until the flesh that surrounds it rots: and its extraction will be eased, and its emergence.
And similarly, if it is fixed in the bone, and does not yield to you for emergence, then leave it also for several days: and repeatedly apply extraction and movement every day, until it emerges.
If it does not yield to you for emergence after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until the arrow's [passage] is widened.
Then pull it, and extract it.
However, if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already penetrated one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of the aforementioned unfortunate events are apparent in the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow, and leave it, until its condition is equalized after days.
For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate to the sifach: and the weak person remains for some days, and nothing from those misfortunes happens to him, then proceed in the extraction of the arrow and its removal.
If, however, it is firmly fixed and does not yield to extraction, then apply a drill around the arrow, as I have told you; then treat the place until it is healed.
If, however, the arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sight, then seek it with probes.
If, however, you feel it, then extract it with certain instruments suitable for its removal.
If, however, you cannot remove it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the arrow's length deep within; and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there, then enlarge the opening around it until the wound is widened and it is possible to remove the arrow.
If it has ears by which it is held, then free the fixed flesh in them from every side, by every means you can, and devise ways, if it is unable to escape, if the flesh is broken in the ears' rupture and twisting, until it escapes.
And when you are performing the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps on all sides, until you make it escape; and use the utmost delicacy, so that the arrow is not broken, and its removal becomes difficult for you.
If you cannot remove it within an hour, then leave it for a few days, until what is around it has begun to decay.
Then try again: for it will be easier then. But if a flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we have said in the cure in its chapter; and protect your skill from incision of a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And employ every means possible for the arrow's escape; and let it be with ease and calmness, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary, when you pull out the arrow, that you do so according to the way it was, according to the position of the arrow's penetration.
Because it is more helpful.
If however it is not possible for you, then use what you can from the figures.
However, if an arrow emerges from the opposite side, either something is already protruding outward, or the arrowhead's tip forms a bump perceptible on the skin's surface above, and you see it protruding; therefore, cut above it, and let the incision be according to the amount that the forceps can grasp.
Then pull it out: for it will be easy to remove.
If however it remains in the bone, then turn your hand in a circular motion until the arrow is embedded in the bone and enlarges itself, then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for a few days, then try again until it comes out.
If the arrow's shaft is in it, then push it out with it.
If however the shaft has fallen away, and you wish to administer a push, then insert a concave instrument so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then push it out with it.
If however the arrow is concave, then push it out with an instrument entering it.
For the arrow is alleviated by it.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cauterize all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you.
Then treat it with that which is appropriate for it.
If the arrow is lodged in the breast, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side; and it is near to that which you touch with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it; then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then suture the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the extremities be similar to the beak of a bird, made of iron; when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
And many kinds of them are made, large, and small, and medium, according to the size and smallness of the arrow, and the size and constriction of the wound.
The form of the concave driver.
And the form of the blunt driver.
This is a blunt extremity like a ray, so that its entry into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be propelled with it.
The extremity of this concave driver is concave like a bird's feather, so that the arrow's entry into it and its propulsion may be eased.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
Chapter XCVII. The veins to be opened, whose use runs through the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which appear in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, called the Looking-Ones; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the extremity of the nose.
And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins that are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins called Algecherich.
And two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins, however, that are opened by phlebotomy in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalica, and it is from the wild side; and the common people call it the vein of the head.
And Fusca.
And it is the Middle vein, and it is composed from a branch of the Basilica, and a branch of the Cephalica; and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And Basilica, and it is located on the domestic side; and it is also called Titillicaris.
And the common people call it the vein of the belly.
And the Cord of the arm, and it is located above the fold; and it is that in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb with clear appearance.
And Saluatella: and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger; and it has two branches.
And in the leg and foot are three veins.
One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb on the wild side.
And the second is Saphena; and its location is at the heel on the domestic side.
And the vein Nesse; and its location is at the heel on the wild side.
And in the other leg are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomies, however, of the two veins which are behind the ears, are a help for old catarrhs, and hemiplegia, and sahafati, and bad old ulcers of the head.
And the quality of phlebotomizing it is according to what I relate.
And it is, that the head of the sick person be shaved, and his occiput be rubbed in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth by a good rubbing.
Then let the sick person tighten his neck with a strip, until the two veins appear.
And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed places of the head.
Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark that place with ink.
Then take a phlebotomous knife, and it is the one called Incidens.
Then insert it beneath the vein in the skin, until the phlebotomous reaches the mouth.
Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upward, and cut the vein with the skin with an incident incision.
And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or approximately that: and cause as much blood to issue forth as you wish.
Then bind it with bandages, and leave it, until it heals.
And already in the beginning of the book the incision of those [things] and their cauterization preceded.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two arteries in the temples.
The phlebotomy of the two arteries located in the two temples is helpful for ancient hemiplegia, and crookedness of the face, and persistent ophthalmia, and the flow of excessive acute secretions to the eyes. And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I tell you.
Let the infirm person draw their neck very much, until two veins appear clearly to the senses, and their pulse is demonstrated under your finger.
Then mark the signs with ink.
Then raise the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the incisioning lancet underneath, and raise the vein upwards.
And cut it, as you did in the two other veins: and cause the blood to run according to your necessary quantity. Then loosen the infirm person's constriction, and place your finger upon the vein for one hour.
Afterwards, place upon it a cloth and cushions, and bind it tightly above the constriction: and leave it, until it heals.
And already the recollection of them, and their incision, and their extraction have preceded in the beginning of the book.
Concerning phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein.
Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the forehead vein is after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein, for the old ailments of the face: and for migraine, and redness: and foul ulcers.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is, according to what I tell you.
The infirm patient ties his neck with a strip, until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument called Fossorium.
Its form is this.
Place the prominent point that is on the head of the Fossorium above the vein itself, and strike upon it with a comb, or with something else in its manner: and let the blood run according to the quantity you wish.
Then loosen the perforation of the infirm person, and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotome.
However, it should not be a phlebotome with a sharp end, like the other phlebotomes, but rather one with a broad end.
And phlebotomize it across, since the bone is near; and perhaps the phlebotome will break in it when it is thin.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins in the two tear ducts.
The relief of the two veins located in the two tear ducts of the two eyes is for eye scabies and redness, and a scab in the eye, and for ailments of the face.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that the weak one tightens his neck with a bandage.
Then phlebotomize them, and you stand over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made across, a little lengthwise, with a small, slightly broad phlebotom, for there is no flesh in the place.
For if the phlebotom is of a slender extremity, perhaps it breaks.
Then make the blood run out as much as you need.
And place a compress on them, and bind them for one night, and loosen them.
Concerning phlebotomy of the veins of the nose.
Phlebotomy of the veins of the nose is beneficial for acute fevers, and violent headaches, and ailments of the face, such as hemicrania, and redness that occurs on the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the weak man tightens his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long lancet, and insert it into the middle of his nostril, between that which divides the nose according to its straightness.
Because the vein is not apparent to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And you should hold your hand with the lancet for a short time, and make blood flow according to your need.
Then tie it with a bandage.
For it quickly recovers.
Concerning the phlebotomy of Guidegi's veins.
Indeed, the benefit of Guidegi's phlebotomy is for the constriction of breathing, and the inception of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and evil ulcers, and corroding ones, that is, burning herpes.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that the weak man holds it tight under both sides of his neck with a bandage: and the craftsman stands over the patient's head, and the patient sits on a seat.
Then the phlebotomist opens the vein to the length of the wide phlebotomy for a short time.
Then draw out a moderate quantity of blood, or according to what you see as necessary for it.
Then do likewise with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the bandage, and tie the two veins with a middle binding, so that the patient is not choked.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound is healed.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of Algeberich.
The veins of Algeberich are helpful in phlebotomy, because they contribute to the prevention of sores in the mouth, and the corruption of the gums: and bad ulcers: and fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those that are in the nose, and around it.
And the quality of phlebotomy of them is, that you should make the sick person sit before you: and bind their neck with a strip.
Then roll back their lip, and look at the two veins: of which one is on the right side of the lip, and the second on its left: and the indication of each is through the blackness of both.
And that is true, because around them are small, black veins.
Therefore, cut each with a cut made incidently. However, if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is: then aim for the incision of the larger of them, and the more manifest of them.
And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and most certainly custom runs with it: and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Of phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
However, the benefit of the phlebotomy of the two veins that are under the tongue is that the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for the suffocations which are in the throat, and the sickness of the uvula, and the sicknesses of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is such that the sick person sits between your hands in the presence of the sun; and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein; and the colour of each should slope towards blackness.
Therefore, phlebotomize each one; and beware that you do not injure your hand when phlebotomizing them.
For beneath it are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will occur from those arteries.
Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
The three veins, however, that are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those in whose phlebotomy custom has run in all men.
And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods.
Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome, or an olive to the fineness of a slope, or by cutting with a knife phlebotome, and it is Alnesil.
And this is its form.
So Alnesil is, what suits for a section.
And from them are broad and subtle types, according to the breadth of the veins and their constriction. The form of the myrtle phlebotome should be broad, as you see.
And it suits for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of lesser width, and of finer extremities.
And it suits for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellowish blood.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the Basilica vein.
The Basilica, which is one of these three veins, is an aid to phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from afflictions that are beneath the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest, and the belly; and it befits the phlebotomist, when phlebotomizing it, to be cautious, and to be above fear of it, for beneath it is an artery.
If therefore he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and an outflow of blood will occur.
Therefore it is necessary, that he not phlebotomize it with a phlebotomy-piercing instrument; rather let him be cutting with an Alnesil.
If, therefore, the Basilica vein does not appear with clear manifestation, then it is necessary to abandon it, and to change to another, or to seek one of its branches; or to phlebotomize the brachial vein in its place.
For it is indeed manifest, and cut it with a phlebotomy Anesil instrument, as we have said.
If, however, you wish to phlebotomize its same place, then it is necessary, before the constriction of the arm, to feel the area, until you know the pulse location.
Then mark the area with ink, afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using a phlebotomy Alnesil instrument, as we have said.
And be careful that the incision does not fall within the space of the artery.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, a swelling in the spot that you have marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore, avoid it.
If you see blood at the phlebotomy leaping forth, like a child's urine, and it is thin, red blood: then know that it is from the artery's blood.
Then quickly place your finger upon it for a long space, then remove your finger.
If, therefore, blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then tighten the arm, and release it: and let the sick person be wary of its movement; and let it be above his fear.
And do not move it for several days, until it is healed.
If, however, the blood does not cut off, and it conquers you, and there is no medicine present at your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
For its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
Or take a piece of fig-bark, and split it: take one half, and bind it over the place of the vein's constriction in a suitable manner, with a bandage and dressings until another day.
Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
And if not, then treat it with what has been previously mentioned from the place of powders that cut off the flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many situations, on account of the small size of the wound, and the possibility of bandaging from the arm.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the Fusca vein.
Phlebotomy of the Fusca vein is beneficial, as it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body, because it is composed of a branch of the Basilic vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it befits the phlebotomist to be wary when performing phlebotomy on it, for there is a nerve beneath it.
Therefore, if the phlebotomist, in making the puncture, encounters a nerve, a numbness occurs, and the healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not completely healed.
And this nerve frequently appears to the senses.
However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle and not shown, then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy, so that you phlebotomize it, a section with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the Cephalic vein.
Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is beneficial, because it draws blood from the head and is helpful in diseases of the eyes.
And it is proper in this vein, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by pricking with an olive phlebotom, or with a myrtle phlebotom, because it is safer than all the veins, because there is no artery nor nerve beneath it. However, it befits you in phlebotomy to avoid striking the head of the muscle, and to seek a gentler location.  And it does not harm it if it is not found on the first strike, so that phlebotomy may be repeated upon it several times. However, perhaps it becomes inflamed in some people when it is not phlebotomized on the first strike, but that inflammation does not harm it in any way.
On the usefulness of Phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
The quality of phlebotomy, and its resultant accidents, which you must consider correcting.
First, you must know that phlebotomy is not performed except in the preservation of health, and its persistence, and caution against the onset of illnesses.
And so that phlebotomy is performed in one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Fusca, and the Basilic.
And that phlebotomy be performed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer; and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And let phlebotomy be performed on the first or third day, after three hours have passed from the day.
However, phlebotomy performed in illnesses does not have a set time: but when convenience and necessity call for it, at night, or by day, and in any hour, and at any time.
And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Nor should elderly people be bled who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore, whenever someone wishes to be bled, for whatever reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before the phlebotomy with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained stool in them, so that the veins do not draw putrid, harmful superfluities from the bowels during the phlebotomy, damaging the principal limbs.
Nor should a patient be bled who has nausea from satiety, nor one who is bloated, nor one recovering from drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Nor a sick person with dropsy.
And phlebotomy should be avoided again after a colic attack, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and excessive intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and anything that dissolves strength from the body or the animal.
Then consider, in the subtlety of the humours beforehand, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines; if it is possible for him to do so.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him; or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood may be refined.
And place his phlebotomy on his chest, about the third day, as we have said; and endeavor that his chest be emptied that day of all harmful animal accidents: such as anxiety, and anger, and fear; and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excessive intercourse, and similar things.
And let him have present in his seat things with whose use custom has run among men from aromatics, and scents, and dances, and things similar to them to the extent possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a pillow which is higher than the phlebotomist's pillow; afterwards, let him pull out his arm, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice, or thrice.
Then let him tie the ligature with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, because constriction, when it is unequal, or by excess in the constriction, then it hinders the flow of blood; or in slackening, then it also hinders the flow of blood.
Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the phlebotomist rub his hands together until the veins swell and become apparent to the senses.
Then let the phlebotomist wipe the phlebotomized area with a little old oil, properly.
Then let him place his left index finger just above the vein, slightly below the place where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein does not move and the puncture is not missed.
Because there are veins that, like a fleeing chord during phlebotomy, and some that are full of air; and when you place the phlebotom on them, they contract under the phlebotom, deceiving the phlebotomist and preventing the opening of the vein; and if he does open it, it is narrow. Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and careful in all these matters.
Then let him remove the phlebotom.
And if not, then do it again a second time just below that place, or slightly above it, with haste, if the place is not already inflamed.
If, however, it becomes inflamed or the patient grows weak, then leave him for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage.
For perhaps it will draw the inflammation.
Nor let him enter a bath.
Then let him have phlebotomy, if he desires.
If the opening is small or the blood flows thinly, and you fear that not the desired amount of blood will issue, then again perform phlebotomy in the same opening along the vein, and add a little more to the operation.
And do it quickly, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place occurs in many people with a minor operation.
If, therefore, you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure on it at all, for nothing excuses you in this. And place on it something from the dregs of oil, since it alleviates the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies, where phlebotomies of the veins are at the prohibition of the flow of blood: and the Tyriaca alfarach and the sagzenea do this, when one of them is placed upon the site.
For blood is refined and resolved, when it is thick.
If a large abscess happens at the site of phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to one who is not a phlebotomist except on that occasion, or the opening of the vein is small, then quickly place on the site a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little: and bind it for one hour, because it is resolved.
And it is necessary to do this after the blood has flowed out from the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
And very often indeed abscesses and swellings occur at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Therefore place your hand upon it; then if you find softness upon your compression upon it, then that swelling is bad.
Therefore beware, that you place something on it from that which we have said.
For perhaps blood will flow from it of an artery.
But make a plaster for it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of its virtue.
And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it exit until it reddens: and likewise if you see it thick, then let it go until it becomes thin: and likewise if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting at once, that the vein incision be enlarged and the phlebotomist be wide: and in the one who is weak, be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary that he extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow: and better that which is administered in vein incision is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safe from blood flow and from nerve incision: and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
And to whom it is accustomed to come upon bloodletting syncope, it is necessary that he eat before bloodletting with moderate bread steeped in pomegranate water: or Secaniabin, if it is heated: and extract from his blood in three or four stages.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before bloodletting bread soaked in date syrup, or in syrup of aromatized honey with spices, or in aromatic fragrant syrup.
If syncope occurs during bloodletting, and its cause is the excessive outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he drink water of flesh and a subtle fragrant syrup; and that he use aromatic substances with alalia and that his chest be lined with it; and that he use the rest that we have mentioned in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
He who wants to empty his arm, and to release his blood a second time: it is necessary for him whose bloodletting is for a great evacuation, and whose strength is weak, to release his blood gradually in proportion to his strength over consecutive days.
However, he who wishes to empty his arm and release his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do so after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting.
He who wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which it inclines, it is necessary that he be emptied on the second or third day.
In whose body, however, there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and it causes fever to occur, it is necessary that blood depart from it in one turn, and a great quantity be extracted from it; and the opening be enlarged until syncope occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and that you place your hand upon his pulse at the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of syncope.
For often that happens, when the bloodletter is ignorant, and negligence falls.
And it is not necessary, when you wish to empty the arm and release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood is difficult, to press upon it with violence, and to rapidly bend or extend it.
For that is very bad, indeed, leave it, until it is bled a second time.
Or remove with sharpness the blood clot from the vein opening, and place some dissolved salt in water upon it.
And place something of tyriaca alfaroch, or sagzenea, upon it, and apply gentle pressure until blood emerges.
If however the vein is already suppurated, then leave it and do not touch it until the abscess subsides.
If necessity compels you to draw blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either bleed him above that spot, or in another arm in another vein.
The arm's vein should be opened at the place of the Fusca and Basilica, if they are not found, and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that the weak person should immerse their hand in warm water until the skin reddens and the vein appears clearly.
Then it should be tied above it with a ligature of medium constriction.
Then the incision should be made transversely, gradually, not laterally, nor lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be just above the joint of the hand for a short while.
And indeed, the course of blood is placed most in warm water in the time of winter.
And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy of the Saluatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for diseases of the liver.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that you should tie the mahason of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you introduce it into warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly visible to the sense.
Then, phlebotomize it transversely.
And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
And take care not to injure your hand with the phlebotome.
For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers bare of flesh.
Then, return your hand to warm water, and let the blood run into it.
For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood coagulates in the opening of the vein, and is prevented from flowing.
When therefore you have extracted the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt over the vein: so that it does not clot quickly.
And similarly, it is necessary that you do with every constricted branch.
The benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand, however, is: because it is beneficial for illnesses of the spleen: and similarly do in its phlebotomy, as you did in the second equally.
The benefit of saphenous vein phlebotomy, however, is for illnesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should immerse their foot in warm water, and make friction upon it, until the veins swell, and tie above the ankle joint with a strap.
And indeed, the vein's location is at the heel, appearing towards the big toe: and from it branch out many branches on the foot's surface.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or at the heel in its aggregation, because it is better and safer.
If you phlebotomize it on the foot's surface, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the foot's surface.
And place your phlebotomy in such a way that you phlebotomize it across, as if you wanted to cut it, and let the phlebotomist be Nesil.
If, however, the flow of blood is prohibited, then again place his foot in warm water, and let the blood run into it, until it is evacuated.
If the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then he should return with his phlebotomy a little higher, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly with the saphena of the other foot equally.
The Sciatic vein's location, as we have said, is near the heel on the wild side.
And the benefit of phlebotomy is for the pain of the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the infirm person should enter a warm bath, and hasten; and he should bind their leg from the side of the hip up to the heel by four fingers, with a thin long bandage: for it does not appear except because of that.
When therefore it appears, then the phlebotomist should lance it according to whatever method is possible for you, or by transverse incision; and it is better either to cut it with an incision or to sever it with a section.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
If you do not find it, and it does not appear at all to the senses, then lance one of its branches, and that one which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear: and beware of the nerves, and cause as much blood to flow as you wish.
Then loosen the bandage, and place leather over the phlebotomy site, and bind the location.
For it heals quickly.
Concerning Cupping, and the quality of its use.
Chapter XCVIII.
Cupping instruments are made from horns, and from bronze, and from glass.
And cupping is indeed done in two ways.
With scarification, and the extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification. And this cupping, which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Or it is with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And cuppings that are administered with scarification and the extraction of blood are fourteen places on the body.
Of which one is the cupping of the Alnocrati, and is at the back of the head; and the Alkehel, and is the middle of the neck; and the cuppings of the Alhagdahim, and are two blades of the neck on both sides together; and the cuppings of the mentum, and are beneath the jaw in the lower mouth; and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades; and the cuppings of the Alachosos above the end of the tail; and the cuppings of the two hollows, and are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of the two thighs; and the cuppings of the two heels.
And cupping indeed does not extract blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and for that reason no virtue is lost from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Nor should cupping, whether with fire or without fire, be administered in any illness arising from fullness, until the whole body is emptied.
If necessity prompts cupping due to illness or custom, we administer it at any time during the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at whatever time it may be.
This is because there are people who, when blood multiplies within them to the point where cupping is needed for its extraction, find heaviness and fullness in their head.
And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
And among them are those who find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And among them are those who scratch the site of their cupping. And among them is one whose laughter is multiplied.
And among them is one who finds the taste of blood in their mouth; or the tongue becomes suppurated, and they spit out blood.
And among them is one whose sleep is multiplied.
And among them is one who sees in their sleep blood and redness, and slain men, and wounds, and things similar to these. Therefore, when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the third middle of the month, we then order that a venesection be performed, after two or three hours have passed of the day. The benefit of venesection of the nape of the neck is that it contributes to the heaviness in the head and that which flows to the eyes.
