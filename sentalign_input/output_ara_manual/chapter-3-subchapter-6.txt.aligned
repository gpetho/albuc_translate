Chapter Six.	CHAPTER six.	0.8974221
On the reduction of a fractured shoulder. The shoulder rarely breaks in its wide part, but rather its edges break. So, whenever a place in it breaks, or it breaks in its middle, and that is known by touch, then reduce it according to the shape of the fracture.	On the repair of a fracture of the scapula. The scapula is rarely fractured in the broad part but it does break at its margins. When any part of it is broken or it breaks in the middle (which is recognized by palpation) you should attempt the correction of the fracture according to the shape it takes, and its restoration to its natural form, by whatever means you can.	0.7905817
Straighten it and return it to its natural shape by any means you can, then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft mashaq, and place over it padding made of folded cloth, then place on it a wide splint made of wood.	Then apply over the place mill-dust with eggwhite, and soft tow; and over that a dressing made of a folded cloth; and over that a broad splint made of thin board to the size of the whole scapula or a little wider.	0.71318793
Thin, according to the size of the entire shoulder, or slightly wider. If there is a curvature under the splint in any of the areas of the shoulder, then straighten that curvature with soft mashaq until the splint sits flat, then tie it from above with a long turban.	If there be beneath the splint a hollow in any part of the scapula, level it with soft tow so that the splint rests evenly.	0.5872945
Tie it tightly and secure the splint so that it does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day. Whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved from its place.  Let the patient lie on his healthy side, and the shoulder heals in twenty days.	Then bind tightly over it a long sling and make sure that the splint does not slip out of place. Examine the bandage daily; and whenever it gets loose tighten it and adjust the splint if it has shifted. The patient should lie on his sound side.	0.84641576
Days or twenty-five days. When this period is completed, loosen the bandage and you are safe, for it is one of the bones that one does not fear will shatter or break. If a splinter protrudes from the bone and it pricks under the skin, then cut over it and extract it. And do what I mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle regarding soothing the hot swelling, if something like that occurs.	The scapula mends in twenty or twenty-five days. When this time has elapsed you may safely loosen the bandaging, for this is one of the bones in which there is no danger of fragmentation or cracking. If a splinter of bone protrudes and starts to prick under the skin, cut down upon it and remove it, and do as I said under fracture of the collar-bone, to allay the effusion, if anything of that kind happen.	0.90926045
