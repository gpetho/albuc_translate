When the cough and pulmonary disease arise from cold humidities and the patient suffers from no fever or wasting but the disease is chronic, sear him with two cauterizations over the two clavicles, in the soft depressions ; and with another cauterization in the mid-line of the chest between the breasts. Let the cautery be claviform as described above.	When cough and lung disease arise from cold humors, and the patient has neither fever nor consumption, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork of the collarbone, in soft, shallow, and empty places. And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; let the cautery be tubular, following the previous form.	0.9049847
And if you prefer, make punctate cauterizations with the cautery called 'punctate'; its shape has already been described under pricking for earache. The punctures should number upwards of thirty.	And if you wish your cauterization to be punctuated with a cautery called “the Point,” which was previously described in the cauterization of ear pain; let there be up to thirty points, almost reaching each other.	0.74226135
Then treat as aforesaid until healed.	Then treat him with what was used before, until he is healed.	0.775421
Sometimes also a trident cautery is prepared, in this manner, with which you can burn more speedily; for with this you can apply three cauterizations at once.	And now let the cautery have three branches, in this shape. Thus the cauterization is alleviated when you make with it three cauteries at once.	0.64294183
