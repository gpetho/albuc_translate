Then heat it over the fire with a moderate heat, as much as the finger can bear when inserted into it, then empty it onto the middle of his head, within the circle, and leave it until it cools.  Do this to the patient once every week, along with all of his other good regimens, until he recovers, God willing.	Then take a pound of stale sheep's butter and warm it on the fire to a moderate heat so that a finger put in can bear it; then pour it out on the middle of the head inside the circle of the bandage and leave it till it has cooled. Do this once a week with other efficacious treatment till he is cured.	0.82073796
And if you wish, cauterize him with many small, dotted burns without holding your hand on the cautery, rather, it should be a quick touch.  For this type of cautery moistens the brain moderately.	If you wish, burn him with multiple small puncture cauterizations; nor press long on the cautery but let this cauterization be only just punctured. For this kind of cauterization will moderately moisten the brain.	0.7418893
