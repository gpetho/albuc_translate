This disease which is beneath, truly called "axacrati," is both natural and accidental. The accident comes from a wound and a cut and a cautery and similar things; and the way to proceed in this is that you take a needle, with a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes in two ends of the flesh; then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.	It is acquired by injury or incision or cautery or something like that. This is the method of operating for it: you take a needle through which has been passed a double thread and you run it into the flesh, making it penetrate from the left angle of the eye to the right angle so that the thread is fixed in flesh both ends. Then with the needle stretch the flesh upwards and make an incision with a broad scalpel; and if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, well and good.	0.76018864
