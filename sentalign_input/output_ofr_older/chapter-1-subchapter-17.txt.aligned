of the treatment of fistula by cautery	On cauterization of a fistula in the angle of the eye.	0.46581507
When you treat a fistula as we have mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not work, then you must cauterize it in this manner.	When you have treated a fistula in those ways mentioned in the sections on diseases, without success, it should be cauterized after this manner.	0.8496698
Instruct the patient to place his head on your lap; and have an assistant hold his head between his hands so it does not move; then place cotton soaked in egg white or parsley juice on the eye; afterward heat the cautery which is shaped like the quill of a vulture, with the cautery at the end; if you wish, it can be pointed from one end to the other, or it can be shaped like a tent; but in any case, the quill-shaped one is very useful for your work.	Bid the patient put his head in your lap; and let an assistant hold his head in front of you without moving or stirring. Then place on his eyes cotton wool damped with egg-white or mucilage of psyllium seeds. Then heat a cautery shaped thus. It should be hollow and in shape like a fine tube, like an eagle's quill, at the one end that is used as a cautery.	0.8807873
Afterward press the fistula if it is open, and extract the pus and dry it; if it is closed, open it and remove the pus; then apply the hot cautery strongly, holding your hand steady over the fistula on the upper part of the eye, so your hand does not slip; place the cautery in the fat of the eye and corrupt it.	Then press on the fistula if it be open and get the matter out of it and wipe it away; or if it is not open, then open it. Then apply to it the cautery, which should be very hot, and press it in with your hand till it reaches the bone. While you are burning keep the hand away from the eye slightly toward the nasal side, lest your hand slip or the patient draw away so that you put the cautery into the ball of the eye and destroy it.	0.84482455
If you reach the bone with the cautery, it would be good. If not, repeat the cautery again, and again if needed, and leave it for three days; afterward apply cotton soaked in butter, and treat with drying ointment until healed; and if forty days pass without healing, apply sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and shave it according to what is mentioned in its chapter.	And if you reach the bone at the first cauterization, good; if not, repeat the cauterization if necessary. Leave it a few days, then put on cotton wool with butter and treat with hygroscopic ointment till it heals. And should forty days have passed and it does not heal, apply a sharp corrosive ointment so as to expose the bone, and strip it as will be explained in the appropriate chapter.	0.8863369
There is a method of cauterizing a fistula that some of the ancients mentioned. Open the fistula, and split the place; afterward place a small chamomile flower in the split, of which this is the shape: and make it to the size of one ounce of lead; and hold your hand firmly on the chamomile, and do not let the patient move, so that the melted lead does not flow into his eye; and it is necessary to place cotton soaked in egg white or water on the eye: the lead burns the fistula and heals it marvelously.	Another method of cauterizing a fistula is that which some of the Ancients mentioned: apply yourself to the site of the fistula and incise it; then insert into the incision a fine funnel, this being the figure of it, and pour into it a drachm of molten lead; and keep your hand on the funnel, holding it firm all the time, and do not let the patient move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eyes. Then you should put cotton wool soaked in egg-white or water upon the patient's eye. For the lead cauterizes the site of the fistula and acts as a marvellous cure.	0.87670064
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery we mentioned, it is good. If not, it is necessary to administer punctures to the nerve, and bring the fistula to the core of the nerve as needed in its proper place.	If the fistula heals by the cauterization and medication we have described, well and good; otherwise perforation of the nose will undoubtedly have to be undertaken to lead the fistula into the meatus of the nose, by the technique that will come in its own place.	0.74967766
