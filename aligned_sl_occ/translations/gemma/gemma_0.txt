O, children, since I have now finished this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, out of love for you and for your profit, and for the exposure of your works, and for the pronouncements of your works, behold that I must teach you that which I have learned to you in this book is part of the art of healing, that is, surgery.
For the art of healing is much more recent in our region and in our time than in the past, since it is full of perils and is most secret; and its secrets are not to be divulged except for a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which alter the greatest things and bring about many errors and suspicion, since they do not understand their meaning and extend the power and the art.
And it is seen by me that I have composed this treatise in such a way as to follow the way of exposition and declaration and brevity; and that in order to make clear the forms of the instruments of cautery and other instruments of the work, as well as for the addition of the declaration, and for preparation, which is necessary.
The greatest cause why one does not find a good artist in our time who is able to practice surgery is that the art of medicine is long, and that it requires a great actor who has been exercised in the science of anatomy, who knows the parts of the limbs and their shapes, and the connection and separation of them; and who has knowledge of bones, nerves and veins, their number and their course, and the sensation of them.
And as Hippocrates says, I who have no name, more in small works, and most in the art of the hand
And as it was said at the beginning of this book, whoever is not learned in anatomy is not worthy of the name of a physician, for they will fall into error and cause the death of men, as I have often seen happen, for many are formed in this science and abandon it for this science and its experiments
For I have seen a foolish and ignorant physician who, having incsed an abscess in the groin of a woman, cut several arteries of the groin so that a great amount of blood flowed, and the woman died between her thighs.
And I have seen another physician who thought he could pull out a stone from a man's belly which he had left there in its time, and the stone was great, and he went to him and cut that stone out with a piece of bladder, and on the third day the man died
And I have already said that we must flee from such things, and I see that because of the greatness of the stone and the condition of the patient, we must know that he will die.
And I have seen another physician who took care of a duke from our land for surgery, and he owed him to a black slave who was in debt to him; and the physician, in his ignorance, closed the fracture of the thigh with sponges and pins with great force, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And thus he left according to his desires, and he relieved him, and he bound him, and commanded that he should not be unbound for five days and commanded that we should not remove the bandage; and thus it came about that the thigh was festered and the man died.
And I went to see him, and I found that he had unbound him, and he had peace and forgot his pains
But indeed corruption was already confirmed in the limb, for it was unable to restrain that one, and it did not cease to spread corruption in the limb until the patient died of the infection
And I have seen another physician who pierced an abscess with a needle, and it bled for several days, until the malignancy of the tumor became greater than that of the master of the house
The cause of this is that cancer is pure melancholy humor, and it does not suffice for it to bring it to the point of its greatest power, but it must be on the limb that suffers so that from that limb should be taken all the nourishment of the whole body.
And thus, children, it is necessary for you that the art of healing be divided into two parts: that which is associated with health, and that which is perilous in the greatest precautions
And I have already spoken of this in all this book concerning surgery in which there is error and fear; for it is necessary for you to preserve this and leave that which will cause the fools to speak and make you ridiculous
Therefore take the sacred arms in the request and in the protection of God, and the wicked diseases in their adversity and their humility.
And thus, with the help of God, you shall be saved and praised, and you shall cast out the terrible diseases that are difficult to heal, and you shall overcome all the other weapons of that which you were afraid, so that you may rejoice in your faith and in your name, for it is your might that remains to your glory, and above all in the world and behind the other saints.
Indeed, I have already spoken in many places about this matter.</end_of_turn> “There is no medicine for a bad disease, for so the learned doctors will not be called by name.”</end_of_turn
And I have already written this book according to three chapters.</end_of_turn>
Begin the division of the book, and first of the first part.</end_of_turn The first chapter treats of the parts of the foot, in the forms of the instruments and the substances of the cautery, and of what is necessary for the operation.</end_of_turn
The division of the second part.</end_of_turn The second chapter deals with swelling and perforation, and of blisters, and of boils, and of the extraction of arrows and similar things, all categorized and arranged according to the forms of the instruments.</end_of_turn
The third chapter treats of restoration and dislocation, and of treatment of fractures and similar things; categorized from the head to the foot, and concerning the forms of the instruments.</end_of_turn
That I say what is the quality of the instruments of that cautery and of their documents, and in what combination it is prohibited to perform cautery.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that the speech about the quality of the instruments of that cautery and of their documents is a long and laborious one, and subtle for science, and a secret that is hidden; and already many learned men have spoken greatly about it, and they have disagreed about it, and I believe that I have only a small part of their speeches, fearing prolongation.</end>
And therefore I say that cautery conforms to all universal completion that is in matter or its matter, except for two completions, which are caudal completions of its matter.</end
In the caudal completion and dry matter, there is disagreement concerning matter; for some say that cautery is useful for that, and others say the opposite, that cautery is not convenient in disease because of its quality and dryness, for the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that disease be treated with that which is both dry and qualitative.</end>
And I say that those who say the opposite are mistaken, for by means of cautery it is useful for all cold and dry diseases that exist in the bodies of men, for when you compare the body of a man with the humidity of his body with the completion of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
And I say concerning this speech that I have already experienced it in some way in my studies.</end_of_turn>
However, I do not say that everything that has been said about cautery is completely new and unexamined in the chapter on cautery after practice, and that one should know the diversity of the humors of men and the disposition of diseases in their places, and the causes of these, and their accidents, and the extent of time of these.</end
In other completions, it is not about you fearing, and more so in the cold and wet diseases, for already all doctors agree on those, and they do not disagree concerning the use of cautery in those.</end
And know, children, that the secret of curing with fire cautery and the goodness of it is that of cautery with acute medicine, for the fire is simple, its action reaches only the member which is cauterized and does not affect the other member next to it except for a small document.</end<end_turn>
For the action of acute medicine reaches only to that in the limb from which it is applied, and it makes it come out in the diseased limb of difficult healing and makes it leave.</end><end_turn>
For fire, by its subtlety and its substance, does not make that which is superfluous. And already we know by experience and by the length of our service in the art that it is useful for the truth of the causes; and for this reason I am excused for the length of this speech, for it is not legible to me in this place in this paper the secret which you have hidden with fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies and the expulsion of the disease which it expels, as is shown in philosophical discourse, which would be acute in the rest of the world.</end><end_turn>
Indeed, children, it is wise to know when it is appropriate to perform cautery and when it is best to delay. The best time is during the springtime.
I say that cautery is appropriate at all times, so that the discomfort caused by the temporary suspension of the cautery is submerged in the benefit of the time when the cautery is actually performed, especially if the cautery is for pain or necessary pain, which do not suffer from delay, for fear that the latter may bring about malice, which is greater than a slight discomfort that arises from the delay.</end_of_turn>
I do not deny that there are other diseases for which cautery is not suitable, or, children, that learned doctors do not recommend it in every case. For this ailment that is cured by cautery, it is not ridiculous at all times, and one should pause at the consequence.</end_of_turn>
And the reason is not that they are deceived by it, for cautery is nothing other than a medicine that alters the complexion and dries out the humors that are the cause of pain.</end_of_turn
Therefore, however, cautery often surpasses medicine in its value and virtue of its operation and greatness of the Lord.</end_of_turn>
It is possible that the disease will return at some later time, according to the complexion of the disease and the location of the disease, and the virtue of the remedies, and what is prepared in the body from the accumulation of humors in it, and what is obtained from it in the acquisition of food and other things; but when the disease in which cautery is administered is a subtle disease in a member of few humors and moisture, just as for example the cautery of a tooth for pain and the like, it is possible that in it the pain will no longer return, even though it is done for small things.</end_of_turn
Indeed, a common saying is that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and it is a saying of great experience, not because one should believe that it is not a cure that uses medicine or any other cause except cautery itself.</end_of_turn
On the contrary, the understanding that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is not true in every case. For in many diseases, other remedies are administered before resorting to cautery, and these remedies do not suffice, so that finally when the cause has been removed, cautery is administered and it is of great use in that.</end_of_turn And thus it is that sixteen years have passed since it was said that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the understanding of the vulgar people and the tricks of the learned doctors.</end_of_turn
The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and I do not say otherwise except for the equality of the gold and the fineness of its substance.</end_of_turn
I have already seen that the location of cautery does not always make a difference, as indeed I have found that in many cases it does not make any difference; and that indeed cautery with gold is better than with iron, as they say. However, when you perform cautery with fire and gold, you must take care that the gold does not burn, for it is ignited according to the quantity you wish for the roughness of the gold, and you must prepare to receive the heat; and if you do not adjust for it, the gold will be burned by the fire and the work will be spoiled.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you perform cautery with iron, you must do so more gently and cautiously, and with greater precision in the execution of the operation.</end_of_turn
I have already arranged this chapter on cautery in chapters, and I have arranged those chapters within this foot, so that I may satisfy the request of those who ask for it.</end_of_turn
First chapter.</end_of_turn>
This cauterization confers to cold and moisture the power of producing an accidental affection of which two causes are its source, so it is the cause of soda and multiple hemorrhages, swelling of the head and limbs and of the joints, swelling of the spleen, sleeplessness, toothache and abdominal pain, and generally of all diseases that arise from cold, even as paralysis, fainting and apoplexy, and is similar in these diseases.</end_of_turn
The form of this cauterization is as follows: first command the patient to evacuate with laxatives, medicine that softens the head for three or four nights, according to the excess of the virtue of the disease and the age and custom of the patient.</end_of_turn
And then command him to shave the head with a razor, and make him sit between your knees on a fallen bank and place your hand over his knees.</end_of_turn
And keep your thumb close to the root of your nose between your nostrils. Moreover, since the physician has said that the limb is affected, mark that area with a cautery, and do so with olive oil of this kind:
And keep that above the area that is affected, in such a way that it descends gradually, with your hand clenched, and you will return it slowly.</start_of_turn>
And then take your hand lightly and support the limb, and if you see that some quantity of flesh has already been uncovered, as much as the quantity of barley grains, then elevate your hand, and if it does not return, do so with the other hand, until it is seen that the limb is no longer uncovered as much as before.</start_of_turn
And take a little salt and dissolve it on the limb and let it stay for three days.</start_of_turn>
And keep your hand covered in fat at the edge and let it stay until the burn of the fire is consumed.</start_of_turn> And take care of the limb so that it becomes painless as soon as possible.</start_of_turn
And I say that when the plague remains open, better take leave of the limb, for it is better and more helpful.</start_of_turn
And I say to you that the bone must be cauterized until it reaches the bone, and must be kept cauterized until all the parts of the substance of the bone are softened.</start_of_turn
And keep the bone moist that which remains of the bone, and keep it cured.</start_of_turn
And I say that it must be cauterized until it reaches the heel, for in this way it will be stronger in the bone when it is finished, rather than if it were finished at the beginning.</start_of_turn And it is estimated that from that limb the vapor of the head escapes.</start_of_turn
And if the plague remains open for a long time, and must be cured when it is solidified.</start_of_turn
I do not know these two species of cautery in all my life, except in some madmen by fear; and leave that, you must know, is better for your health than to risk it for the sake of some trifle. For indeed the head is developed from the solution of the continuation of its kind as we have testified in other members, and especially when the head of the patient is of fiery nature.</start_of_turn
The first cautery is better and more helpful, you must know, and from that we have seen better results in this work than in any other.</start_of_turn
Chapter two.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of the head.</start_of_turn
When in all the head chronic pain of a long duration occurs, and when it is prolonged in the disease, use of poultices and cloths and caps and plasters and mustard and vinegar and eggs and barley and alum, and especially if the head of the disease is of fiery nature; and do not be afraid of great heat, for indeed that which cauterizes with another cautery leaves a little space. And cauterize that on the heel of the foot with a pointed cautery until the bone is softened.</start_of_turn Incise the bone and uncover from the bone the quantity which we have recounted and cauterize that which is in the posterior part of the head in the area where it is applied to the vein — and that is the place where the vapor escapes.</start_of_turn And hold your hand lightly in support, and do not uncover the bone, for the disease because of that will find great pain other than the pain of all the other cauteries of the head.</start_of_turn
I say that this cautery in its place is more subtle than the one which is applied to the heel of the foot and the occiput; and this is the way to do it.</start_of_turn
Chapter three.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of the ancient emigration.</start_of_turn
When there is swelling in the part of the head, or widespread pain in the heel, evacuate with medicines the head which is mondified, and administer the other care which I have mentioned in the preceding chapters; and do not neglect, for indeed the cautery in this case is done in two ways: with acute burning medicine or with the iron.</start_of_turn
May I ask that you provide the next sentence in the text for translation? And then prick the area of pain in the temple with a lancet, and when it has bled out, leave the wound open until the clot has formed.
And then strengthen the area around the stop by applying pressure to reduce constriction, and leave it for three hours; then remove the dressing and bring in the alum, and leave the bandage on for two or three days, and finally rest over the limb immersed in cold water until the wound heals
And take care of the patient until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
And if you wish, know that there are many medicines that I have written about in the treatise of remedies.</start_of_turn>
May the cautery be carried out according to this manner: fire for cautery of this kind: ...</start_of_turn
... and it is called closed nails, where the head of the nail is like a nail with a curvature in the middle, and at the end of the nail is a small protrusion.</start_of_turn>
And rest over the area of pain, and hold your hand - so that the surrounding tissue is not torn - and gently remove the fire little by little at a speed.</start_of_turn
And if the quantity of tissue that is burned by the heat of the clot is greater than half, elevate your hand so that the artery is not torn, which would prevent the flow of blood.</start_of_turn
Then soak the limb in salt water and rest it on the area, and leave it for three days; then rest the limb with a bandage on, and take care of the patient until they are healed.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize at the tip of the toe according to the cautery, and take care to avoid cutting an artery in this movement.</start_of_turn
Chapter four.</start_of_turn>
On cautery of an ancient embolism.</start_of_turn
When you have cured the embolism with what has been said in the preceding care, and what has been said in the divisions of diseases, and you do not take advantage of the care, sometimes for the disease does not reach that which has been said of the first cautery with medicine or of the cautery with fire, then when you ignite the cautery of the toe let it burn until it is whitened, for it signifies that the pain is in the middle of the toe, or that the tip of the toe; then withdraw your hand for a moment and strengthen the area where you made the incision to prevent the artery from being torn.</start_of_turn
However, you must take care of the continuity of the mandible, which is important for chewing, and that the nerve is not torn and that no spasm occurs.</start_of_turn
And if it is about the custody and care of the flow of blood of the artery that is being cauterized, for fear of its rupture, and more so for that one who ignores what is done and is negligent; leave the operation in peace from the beginning.</start_of_turn
And I remind you of the regimen of the flow of blood according to the custom of this land in this place.</start_of_turn
And if you see that this disease does not benefit from this cautery and that the patient can tolerate the pain, cauterize that in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and care for the wound until it has healed.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on the stretching of the artery with two nails, for this is a better cautery and more effective.</start_of_turn
Chapter five.</start_of_turn
On the cautery of heel pain.</start_of_turn
When in the heel there is pain due to cold and it is cured by means of laxatives and other care that has been mentioned in the division, and the pain persists, then ignite the cautery, for this is the one that has no puncture, which has the following form: ...</start_of_turn
And prick around the ignition, and let the surrounding area of the heel rotate around as if it were a wheel, or in the circumference of any limb if the pain is in any part.</start_of_turn Slowly withdraw the cautery from the root of the heel little by little as you see it has cauterized the area.</start_of_turn
If there are several points made with the cautery all over the ankle, and what is the cause of this, then cure the area until it is healed.
If there are several points made with the cautery all over the ankle, and what is the cause of this, then cure the area until it is healed.
If there are several points made with the cautery all over the ankle, and what is the cause of this, then cure the area until it is healed

Pause between each cautery the thickness of the thumb, and then care for the cautery as it proceeds.
May be you will grow weary and the patient is intolerant, but nevertheless do the cautery in the middle of the foot; and if you wish to add more, burn over the two nails.</end_of_turn>
Care for that which is sound; and let the cautery be olive oil as it is directed.</end_of_turn
End of text.</end_of_turn>
Of cautery of nails and of the mollification of all the body.</end_of_turn>
That you process in mollification of the head as jars and as we have said; and then cauterize the head of the patient, and cauterize that which is in the middle of the head of the foot, and on all the nails of the head, and on the backside of them. And make three cauteries on the spines of the heel.</end_of_turn
And if it is necessary in the disease of mollification of the body of the feet those which are intolerant and the disease is strong, then cauterize that which is at four cauteries on the spines of the thighs, and immediately after that cauterize that which is within that is covered by the hair of the foot, and remove the thick hand.</end_of_turn And care for that which is sound; and this let it be olive oil.</end_of_turn
End of book.</end_of_turn
Of cautery of epilepsy.</end_of_turn
It is not cauterized the epileptic but that epilepsy is for spasm.</end_of_turn
And therefore we must modify the head of the patient from the beginning until the end of the treatment and the other care that we have dictated in the division when the patient is great and is tolerant of the exception of the medicines.</end>
And if it is a child who does not suffer the medicines, then the hour administer safeguards and masticators serve us to modify it, giving him that for a few days, for the benefit of the foods.</end

End of book.</end_of_turn>
Of cautery of melancholy.</end_of_turn
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and great spasm, the hour cauterizes that which we have said in having paralyzed.</end
And if the cause of melancholy is excessive going down to melancholy, and the body of the patient is humid, the hour gives him to drink that which modifies the head of the patient according to what has been said in the division.</end
And then remove the head of the patient, and then make a slight wound downward make a wound of little extent around the circle, and withdraw that which is in the middle of the head.</end

And give the patient every day a little vinegar, or if you wish, cauterize that which makes little holes according to the greater part of it, but keep your hand over it in such order: this is a kind of cautery which moistens the head with equality.</end
And then remove the clot in the belly bordered or in gray of grease.</end<end_turn
Capitol XII.
From the cautery of water they descend upon the heel.
When it is declared that water must be applied to the heel for the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then the doctor must commence and give it to the patient until the pain changes, and must protect him from all moisture
And make him bathe in oil for several days.
And command him that he keep his head still, and cauterize that mark on the middle of the head; and cauterize two marks on two temples if this is the beginning of the application of water to two heels, or one on the heel if it is the beginning of the application of water to one heel
Incisions must be made on the mark of the cautery of all the veins and arteries which are left in the wound; and let the cauteries be made in that length in the breadth of the temples
And protect him from the flux of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see blood flowing from it, stop any medication that you can give him.
And I know of a knowledge which is in the extraction of arteries and in the extirpation of those and caution against blood flow
And every vein is cauterized at the root leaving two bones and two cauteries in their place respectively
Chapter XIII.
Of the cautery of ancient tears
When tears of the heels are ancient, accumulated and for the veins and arteries which are in the area manifested on the head outside and it has been verified that these are superfluous fatuous humors, then the doctor cauterizes that mark which we recounted in the chapter of the beginning of the application of water to the heels, and the mark in the middle of the head and two cauteries on the root leaving two temples, and two cauteries on the root leaving two bones. And if he demands it again, then the doctor cauterizes that on the whole length of the heel over the edge of the heel with a small mark
Chapter XIV
Of the cautery of the stench of the nose
When your physician has said that which we have mentioned in the division and does not profit from your medication, then you must appear and give the patient vinegar to drink for three nights; and at the same time keep his head still, and cauterize the mark between the eyebrows And cauterize that mark between the eyebrows with a nail and two cauteries on the two eyebrows leaving a little space between them
And protect him from the wound that you do not burn that area.
And this is the form of the nail cautery
Chapter XV
Of the cautery of the softening of the eyelids of the heels
When the eyelid of the heel is softened by illness or humidity, then the doctor cauterizes that eyelid with a needle and this is the way to do it:
And if you are doing it, cauterize over the two eyebrows a little and with two cauteries throughout, and let them be long from the temples. And the length of each cautery is according to the amount of the eyebrow
And do not touch the meat too much with the cautery, but according to the quantity that the third part of the eyelid is adhered
Chapter XVI
Of the cautery of the eyelid of the heel when they are converted into parts of fat and put the heel in the air
When the parts of the heel are converted into fat parts as soon as you put the heel in the air, cauterize in those two ways, either by making or by medicine that burns
If you cauterize with fire, command the patient to drink vinegar until the veins relax as those which are subject to it; and if you put it on, strengthen the heel of the patient with a bandage so that it is not painful until the veins are reborn
When they are reborn and healed, then the doctor must keep the patient's head in the belly and approach again over the eyelids of the heels of the patient with a needle, in the manner of the leaf of a myrtle, and be the beginning of the sign near the veins
And so stop the bleeding at the source by applying a bandage of wool or in mucilage of pills over the wound.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
Then cauterize over the area which you have marked, little by little, in streaks, until the surface of the skin which is like ash is consumed, as much as if it were a twig of myrtle, completely in appearance.
And a sign of the healing of the work is that you see the pupil of the eye already contracted and the surrounding area elevated because of the puncture of the wound.
And therefore raise your hand and place it there for three days, and so stop over it the edge until the scar is healed. And so care for that which is still swollen until it is healed.
Maybe if it returns for any reason, then renew the cautery and soften the pupil, for the hour will be another occasion to make the point as before.
Maybe if the area is in the pupil, then cauterize that until it is elevated to its natural position and is soft and the area does not touch the wound again.</start_of_turn>
Maybe the cautery should be done according to medical advice, for it is commanded to the patient to rest the area until it is prolonged and soft, and you should provide a bandage of linen in the form of a twig of myrtle.
And so take an oath with knowledge and cause life to be given again. I swear, etc. Or thus I swear, etc., that I will mix these causes together, and I will act with fasting so that I am not enraged; and I will expand over the bandage which is made like a twig of myrtle, and I will stop over the wound above one eye or both; and I will stop leaving the wound open in the belly, and the head of the patient will be in the thigh.
And so stop the bleeding at the source and do not move until the patient sits on the bite of the medicine, which bite is in them just like fire.
And so when you perceive that the bite has ceased, then read the medicine and do not touch it again until I tell you; when the bite has ceased, then remain the medicine and wash the wound with water; and then consider whether the pupil is already lifted just as if washed after the constriction with fire or incision, for the hour is well aware of this; and if it does not return over the medicine on the place where it was not pressed with the medicine and did not leave a mark until the operation is healed and the pupil is contracted again.
And so stop over the edge until the mark of the wound has disappeared, and so care for that which is still swollen until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you must guard diligently that in the eye no falls again the medicine, and if the pupil is somewhat days softened and any cause of the area touching the eye, repeat your medicine over that place where the pupil is softened, just as you did at the beginning, and indeed in this way as well.
This is the form of a twig of myrtle.
You know that the humors of men are diverse according to their magnitude and their smallness, and therefore according to what is appropriate for each case.</start_of_turn>
Do not be ashamed of the way things are done in this art.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn>
Of cauterization of the fistula which is in the tear duct of the eye.</start_of_turn
When you treat the fistula with that which we have said in the divisions of diseases and you do not confer your care, then command the patient to keep their head down in the thigh, and hold their head by any minister between the thighs in such a way that it is neither too taut nor too relaxed in the thigh cap
And so stop the bleeding at the source by applying a bandage of wool or in mucilage of pills over the wound of the eye.</start_of_turn
And so make the point with the pointed cautery, which is like this:
which is concave, like a hook or the beak of a vulture, from one extremity to the other where the point is made.</start_of_turn
And if you go, penetrate from one extremity to the other.</start_of_turn If you wish to depart thus with your attempt.
If you wish to depart thus with your attempt.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And immediately draw out the wound and dry that area. And if it is not opened, then simply open that wound and extract the pus from it
And place your hand over the area with a little cushion under your thumb, so that you do not burn your hand or make the patient more restless, and when you have placed the cautery on the wound, grasp the cautery with your thumb and index finger and proceed to burn the wound
Therefore if at the beginning of the treatment the cautery has penetrated the bone, it is not good; otherwise repeat the cautery once or twice if necessary; and leave the wound open for three days, and place your hand over that area and keep it covered with an absorbent dressing until it is healed
If even after six days it is not healed, then place your hand over the acute corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is scraped as it is convenient in the aforementioned book.
Another method of cautery for fistula is as follows: enter the hole of the fistula and burn that area, and then place your hand over that split in the heel of the foot which is the cause of the fistula; and pour in the quantity of lead that is sufficient; and keep your hand firmly in place, do not be afraid of the patient so that the lead does not reach the head; and cover the head of the patient with a cushion filled with wool or in vinegar, so that the lead adheres to the hole of the fistula and heals that wonderful way.
And if the fistula has healed with the cautery and care mentioned above, it is not good; otherwise it is necessary to administer medicine from the nose and reduce the fistula to the root of the nose as it will be in its proper place

When the veins are softened by humidity and the teeth are blackened, and you treat those with medicines and do not confer relief, then place your thumb on the patient's thigh and grasp the cautery in the shape that will come soon, and as soon as you have placed the cautery on the tooth, immediately ignite it and keep your hand over that until the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth being cauterized.</end_of_turn
And then remove your hand and repeat the cautery several times as you wish.</end_of_turn
And finally rinse the patient's mouth with salt water and keep that for an hour, and then remove it, because the blackened tooth is stopped and the softened gum is strengthened and the moisture that has been corrupted is dried up.</end_of_turn
Capitol XXI.
From the cautery of foot pain.
When tooth pain is due to cold, or when it is cold or wet, or if you do not agree with the treatment with medicine, then do the cautery in two ways: either at the edge of the wound or over the fire.
The edge cautery is that you take the edge of a calf and put it into the hole of a nail, and then take a thread and wrap it around the tip of the limb, and then immerse that which is bulgy, and stop that over the painful tooth until it is heated.
And in this way repeat the treatment until the virtue of the fire reaches the root of the teeth.
And if you want, immerse thread or thread in the wound under the thumb, and place that over the painful tooth, and place over that the burning iron until the iron reaches the bottom of the curvature of the tooth
However, the cautery with fire is that you take care of the quantity of charcoal or fire, and be in the center of them any blackness or the acuteness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.
And in this way ignite the fire in the form that you desire, and place that over the tooth and keep your hand there until the cautery is heated; and do some veguadas so that the pain should be gone either that day or the next day or the other day.
And know that for the execution of this cautery the patient must fill his mouth with good flesh and keep it for an hour, and then remove it; and this is the way of the cautery.
And cauterize as much as you can according to what is possible for you.
And this is the form of the cannula:
Capitol XXII.
Of the cautery of exostoses.
When exostoses are of flexibility and cold humors and do not obey digestion by medicines and you want to digest them slightly, then you ignite the fire following this form, having two hands covered so that the smoke does not reach the other hand, and place that ignited over that abscess one veguada, and another if you wish to digest that, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess
And if the abscess is small, then pause the cautery according to the quantity of the abscess, and keep it covered with a cloth for three days and place over it the thumb enclosed in flesh until that which the fire has consumed is gone
And take care of that with oil and threads and cloths until it is healed
Capitol XXIII.
Of the cautery of hoarseness of voice and constriction of the throat.
When humidity comes over the root of the lung, and especially when it is cold and wet, then know that the patient must be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and in this way cauterize that which is beyond the root of the epiglottis in the hollow part.
And know that you must not bring the cautery near the epiglottis or burn the edge of the cord, but only a little bit.
And cauterize that which is beyond another cautery must be done at the joint of the collar in the back of the vertebra. And the cautery of the throat must be carried out in the manner mentioned above.
And take care of that which is before until it is healed
Capitol XXIV.
Of the cautery of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are due to cold humidity and the patient has no fever or chills and is an old disease, then do two cauteries over the thyroid in the hollow parts under the cartilages and another cautery in the middle of the foot between two nipples; and do the cautery in the claw-like fashion mentioned above.
And if you wish, do the puncture with the cautery that is called puncture, the form of which is mentioned in the puncture of heel pain
The needle shall enter quickly into those; and immediately care for that which is before that which is to be cauterized is healthy.
And thus it is that the cautery should not have three ramps, for the cauterization is on that which is to be cauterized: once having cauterized three times in this way.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XXV.</end_of_turn>
Of the cautery of the toe which is the head of the assistant.</end_of_turn
When the head of the assistant is displaced due to oily humidity and is not fixed at the time of the seizure, you must displace the dislocation until it is back in its place as it usually happens. And thus, as we have testified, when the joint is displaced first reduce the dislocation, and then reverse the patient either over the seat or on the side of the bed; and elevate the heel which is on the inside of the toe to the parts below which are called from your left hand, if the joint is displaced to the inside.</end_of_turn
And thus the cautery has two heads; and this is how it is done:</start_turn
And thus cauterize the heel until it penetrates the other side; and the figure of the cautery will be that of four cauteries.</start_turn
Each bundle is adjusted according to this count and because there are eight cauteries.</start_turn
And thus rest on the cautery for a while with salt, and make the patient adhere to tranquility, and the limb should not be painful for any time until it is comforted.</start_turn
And if the dislocation is to the outside and is urgent, then immediately cauterize over the muscle which is under the cautery claw or with three cauteries pointed, so that the joint is confirmed and the humidity is reduced and the patient is healed.</start_turn
Chapter XXVI.</start_turn
Of the cautery of the stomach.</start_turn
When there is cold and moist humors in the stomach that come from its swelling and multiply the worms in it, and if you continue your treatment methods and do not confirm them, then you must reverse the patient onto their back and extend their legs and arms, and immediately cauterize three times: on one cautery leave the feet for the quantity of one claw of the cautery claw, and on two cauteries leave the two sides of the cautery, until the triangular figure of the cautery appears; and lengthen among those that are not adjusted that will make the wound less painful.</start_turn
And if the depth of the cautery is the quantity of two thirds of the thickness of the heel.</start_turn
And the figure of the cautery is as follows: if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach as follows; and this is a cautery in the shape of a circle as follows:</start_turn
And the stomach is cauterized point by point until that which is around this cautery is scared: and you will mark over the stomach point by point as much as you wish with hair, and immediately cauterize that which is around the claws; and immediately care for that which precedes until it is healed.</start_turn
Chapter XXVII.</start_turn
Of the cautery of the great toe.</start_turn
When there is pain in the great toe due to cold, humidity, or excessive wind that has caused the limb to swell abnormally, and it has not been cured, then you must reverse the patient onto their neck and mark three cauteries as follows and with this quantity above the great toe beyond the hip bones, holding the heel of the foot.</start_turn
And the space between each cautery is according to the thickness of the toe, and the cauteries are according to the length of the bone that is broken.</start_turn
Do not tighten over the cauteries too much.</start_turn
And if the quantity of liquid that is adhered to the quantity of the major part of the heel, and it is not too tight; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if not, then the hour is sitting, which has already extended their legs, and lift the hips.</start_turn
And it is possible that you cauterize these points with a pointed cautery, when it is appropriate to your skill and prudence in the art.
Be careful not to overdo the cautery, and be aware of the entirety of the limb so that the whole body is cauterized and the wound reaches the bone, for the limb is sensitive here; know this well.</end_of_turn>

Of the perforation of the heel with a cautery.</end_of_turn
When the heel protrudes or swells in the foot and you wish to know if that swelling is in the bone of the foot or in the membrane of the foot, if it is in the bone of the foot, the pain is violent and the swelling is acute.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the membrane of the foot, the pain is acute and often the doctors are unable to cure it.</end_of_turn
Therefore cover the patient with a sheet; and then grasp the foot of the swelling with your hand; and then cauterize the point with the cautery which is assembled like a brush, as we have mentioned previously.</end_of_turn And cauterize until the whole limb is covered, until it reaches the bone, until the wound has healed.</end_of_turn
And take care of the care of the other swellings until they have healed.</end_of_turn
And do not use this method of cautery except for those who have studied medicine for a long time and who know many diseases; for indeed in many cases this is useful for some diseases; but in this case read what we must say, for it is better.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXIX.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of the pleura.</end_of_turn
I say that the ancient cauteries of the roots of astrology to the inflamed pleura are done in this manner: take from the roots of astrology a long dry twig about the thickness of a finger and cauterize it.</end_of_turn
Then immerse that in oil and put it in the fire and cauterize in the place where the furcula joins the ribs; and at two small cauteries leave guiding two little points, one slightly declining from the part that is below the beard, and two cauteries at the level of the fifth costal cartilage and the twelfth rib, declining slightly at the back; and another cauterization in the middle of the foot; and another over the stomach; and three cauterizations on the back; and one in the place between the two scapulae, and two cauterizations on the two sides of the foot, leaving the cautery between two scapulae.</end_of_turn
And do not put your hand over the cautery, but rather hold the limb still with work.</end_of_turn
And indeed I say that the old men say that these are the instruments of the blacksmiths who use a cautery like a ray and an igniter; and put that in the place between the ribs, until we reach that swelling and it is cured, as we have said in the swelling of the foot.</end_of_turn
However in this perforation with the cautery there is no fear, for many times this has happened in the fistula where there is no healing.</end_of_turn

Of the cautery of the meatus.</end_of_turn
When you cure the disease of the meatus with what we have said of the care in the division and you do not confer your care, the hour you cauterize in it is in three ways, which are all safe, namely that you make three or four lines according to the length of the meatus according to the figure of the cauteries of the foot, the figure of which has been mentioned before.</end_of_turn
And between each cautery let the thickness be that of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cautery is the manner which we have said in the cautery of the foot equally.</end_of_turn
And do not put your hand over the cautery; and the patient should be even above the waist.</end_of_turn
And another manner of cautery is that you ignite the cautery having two assistants, which causes we have mentioned in the chapter of dislocation of the muscle, and elevate the limb which is in the depth of the meatus so that it does not touch the left side of the patient.</end_of_turn
E sia la tua elevacio am la qual elevas la codena segon la longuesa del cors, per que sian faytz cauteris segon la latitut del cos.
And bring together the two veins, ignite more, in that place where they penetrate the knee of the other side.
And extract the cautery; and thus are four cauteries made
And if you wish, cauterize at the tip of the cautery where there are three veins.
And then keep the cautery still until it has left behind the black scab for several days, which is different from the other preceding causes in the treatment
Chapter XXV
Of cautery of hydropic swelling
Cautery does not take in hydropic swelling but in air properly
When you cure the hydropic swelling by the methods of treatment which we have said in the division and do not confer your treatment, then know that you must cauterize four cauteries around the belly and one on the stomach, and one on the heel, and two between the vertebrae of the two, and one at the root of the foot, and one on the stomach. And the quantity of the depth of the cautery is proportional to the size of the knee
And then keep the cautery covered so that it does not burn for a long time
And do not evacuate the patient from treatment because of the cautery at the place where you cover it so that they are added to two understandings, and if you are fasting them along with the treatment.
The form of the cautery with which you cauterize the belly is like a claw as we have said beforehand, and the one in which two olives are cauterized as we have said before regarding their form

When the feet are swollen with hydrosis and are filled with sour water, know that you must cauterize the feet over the two of the foot near the ankle without burning them; and hold your hand over the cautery and do not move away from it; and elevate your hand and do not return it until the sour water has drained out
This is the cautery in this form: And make two cauteries on the two surrounding areas, and in any place where there is a prominent cautery at the extremity of the cautery cut And the cautery is according to the length of the area: and leave the nails of one and the other under the middle of the area; and make two cauteries on each area
And keep the wound open for a long time so that any water drains from it
And treat the other causes which we have mentioned.

When the abdomen is hot and humid and the intestines are swollen, so is the digestive and retaining virtue, which is in the stomach and in the intestines, and it is cured by the methods of treatment and is not conferred, and sometimes the patient suffers from cauteries showing the virtue, then know that you must cauterize that which is a great cautery over the great stomach as we have said in the cautery of the stomach, and over the circle and four cauteries in the subtile belly, and a claw-shaped cautery under the skin; and a cautery over the navel above the large intestine, or two cauteries
And if sometimes the external humors and the patient tolerate it, then know that you must cauterize that over the flanks and over the intestines, and strongly adjust two cauteries over the stomach and near the groin, which is a perfect cure for these ailments from which you will not err

Then cauterize the pain on the ankle with a circular burn, because you have seen that there is swelling in the circumference of the area as if it were rotated, and to prevent the limb from falling from the circle.
And the cautery that precedes should be performed like the cautery of the stomach
And if this cautery is not at hand, then cauterize once with three cauteries with olive oil

On cautery for the sciatic vein
When there is pain in the area of the ankle, due to cold and humidity, the pain is treated as mentioned above and not confirmed, and when it is old, then it is necessary to remove the pain of humors from the limbs with either solid pills or artificial or similar pills; and then cauterize it.
And the method of cautery in this case is according to two methods: either with burning medicines or with fire
The other is that which cauterizes the area around the ankle with three triangular cauteries according to this shape; and make them at a good depth. And the space between each cautery should be as much as the thickness of the finger, and if there is olive oil or grease.
There are some who say that the cautery should be made on the middle part of the ankle over the head of the bone for there are four cauteries
Or you can cauterize like the circle that precedes the shape of the dislocation of the ankle, and that is a continuous circle and will burn the spiciness of the whole area
This is the method of cautery for the sciatica when the pain is limited to the ankle and does not extend into the limb.
If it extends into the limb, then cauterize twice on the limb over the area where the pain originates, and once on the heel for four fingers a little beyond the wrist part
If the cautery burns deeply, the depth of the burn should be in proportion to the intensity of the codium.
If the patient says the pain extends up to the ankle, then cauterize that area where you made the burn with three points or four or more if necessary.</end_of_turn>
If the patient says that the pain is coming from below, then cauterize that area where the burn is deepest.</end_of_turn>
Be careful during the cautery that you do not burn nerves or great vessels, and that for this reason you must keep an eye on the patient to see if there is any damage or contraction.</end_of_turn>
I have already seen some who have cauterized over the cavity and finished the cautery, and the limb was swollen until the tumor had reached the foot, and it was perforated and corrupted the whole limb.</end_of_turn Then apply a strong solution of vinegar, and immediately the patient will die.</end_of_turn>
If the pain is in two parts together, then cauterize each one according to this manner.</end_of_turn
And the learned men say that in the cautery of any burn, the circumference should be like the circle of a nail, and the depth of the burn should be equal to the thickness of a date seed or less.</end_of_turn
And the circles should be a third of an inch apart; and the space that is between them should be equal to the quantity of the grain of wheat; and if the circles are opened up from two parts, let the length of those lines be a nail or two nails, and make on those marks of iron which are properly placed in the circles.</end_of_turn
Then let the fire be kindled in the firebox until it is well alight and there are sparks, and then let the burn be placed over the part of the limb, and the patient will lie on his side.</end_of_turn And thus cauterize that area with three cauteries round about at once.</end_of_turn
Then keep the burn covered for three days; then cover the burn with an ointment and leave the wound open for a few days; and finally care for the burn until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Say Albucasis: or, friends, of this kind of burn, little have we used for the terror of its regard, and for what little has been found to be efficacious concerning it.</end_of_turn
More of the best cauteries for those who suffer from them, and find on that place where they suffer.</end_of_turn
More cauteries are better than medicines that remain, as two circles should be made with the nail pierced, in which the patient should be given the vinegar of the door of iron; let the length of the line from the head to the tail of the nails be two nails or more.</end_of_turn
And if the space that is between them is equal to the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and if they are opened up from the sides, and if they contain each other according to this form:</end_of_turn
Then place your hand over the part of the limb, the patient will lie on his side, and compress your hand over the part of the limb; and take warm water and pour it between the circles, and let the quality of that water be small at first, and increase it gradually, and keep that for the quantity of an hour, and suffer the patient the biting and swelling of the limb — for that other bite like fire — until the biting stops.</end>
And then lift your hand up to the instrument and wipe away the warm water from the whole limb with wet water.</end_of_turn>
And then keep it covered for three days, and pause over that border until the black of the swelling has gone, and keep it wet for several days, and remove it when it has subsided; this is useful for treatment.</end_of_turn
Finally care for the burn until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the pain is extended within the thigh or the limb, make them lie down in such a way as to contain the water according to what is done with the ankle swelling.</end_of_turn
This is the way of lukewarm water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.</end_of_turn> Recipe for alkali and caustic of both equal parts, and grind them together and pause in a new liquid from which the part that remains should be perforated with a small hole according to the quantity that enters into it.</end_of_turn
The swelling of the foot caused by cold humors fills all the members of the body, and when pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Reduce all that water, and take the sweet water again and another alkaline substance, because when that happens the hours will be stronger. This is administered in doses of medicine and in cautery of the other members, for that operation is of fire.
And of some medicines which are cauterized widely, thus quickly and smoothly and make a mark that appears to be more mixed.
And thus an old man of the ancient times related the operation and care which cured him of ankle and sciatica pain, and praised the doctor so highly that he said that no other treatment was necessary, and that he was healed simply by a light touch, just as recommended, for that he perceived that the knot had already been loosened by that.
And indeed, it is close to certain that if it is not seen green, it is a recent bruise; and if it is not seen green, take a fresh bruise; and do not break it with a little gray, but rather keep it bound to the ankle where the pain is, or in the cavity, or in the limb, and bind it tightly.</start_of_turn>
And let it be left for three hours or for the quantity that the patient can tolerate of the reduction.
Then put that in the bath and thus when the body is relaxed, bring that into the sun, for the pain will cease and he will be healed.</start_of_turn>
Beware that one should not use too much cautery with these medicines but rather accompany the evacuation of the body.</start_of_turn
Indeed, it is said that when the vein is stripped from the goat, the cautery is applied to it immediately; and let the cautery be done in this manner: take wool and soak it in oil against the cold, and apply it between the ankle and the heel.</start_of_turn
And so take a dry split from a goat and burn that with fire until it is black; and then place it over the wool and read until it is stretched out.</start_of_turn And so repeat the water, and do not cease until the sensation of the bite reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.</start_of_turn
And this method of cautery is called the cautery of the cows.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXXII.</start_of_turn>
Of the cautery of two pains.</start_of_turn
Some pains are in two places simultaneously, as in the case of worms or for bruising or excessive evacuation, and for such causes, from infusion of rough and wet matter.</start_of_turn
The cautery does not bite except in this single kind which is useful for the evacuation of rough matter.</start_of_turn
Therefore cover, with the evacuation of the patient with pills that are fixed and similar to them, that they are useful over the two in which the pain is three lines according to the latitude of them, because since they have an attempt in any line or cautery or more, according to the quantity that the patient can tolerate and the strength of them.</start_of_turn
And the cautery is useful with point cautery.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cautery claws or with four middle claw cautery in this manner:</start_of_turn
Chapter XXXII.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery at the beginning of swelling.</start_of_turn
Most often this disease affects the small children; and a sign of the beginning of it in children is that it affects their limb in the groin and causes elevation and movement.</start_of_turn
And another symptom is that the vertebra of the back and those of the neck begin to overcome the others.</start_of_turn
And therefore when you sometimes see it and you want to prohibit it, the hour cauterizes that which is circular according to this manner:</start_of_turn that it surrounds the cautery over the whole extent of the vertebra.</start_of_turn
If you wish, cauterize around the ankle joint at the point of puncture, making two or three lines. And make the punctures properly between them.</start_of_turn>
Then take care of the wound so that it heals as we have said.</start_of_turn
Beware that the cautery is not administered too vigorously, as this may cause spasm of the nerves.</start_of_turn
(The text continues with medical instructions and observations.)</start_of_turn
On cauterization of gout and joint pain.</start_of_turn
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn
And thus, when gout is cured by cold means with proper treatment, the pain is not left behind; the puncture remains.</start_of_turn
And thus, you cauterize near the discharge in the ankle joint without cauterizing.</start_of_turn
And thus is the form of the olive oil:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.</start_of_turn And if the pain extends to the bones or to the other joints, and when the swelling subsides, then cauterize over each pain point with three punctures or four in total using this olive oil cautery.</start_of_turn
And if more punctures are required than these, then cauterize cautiously and do not press your hand too close to the cautery before, only slightly exceeding the thickness of the cuticle.</start_of_turn
And if the pain extends to the bone itself, then administer the cautery as we have said in the preceding chapter.</start_of_turn
And if the pain is only in the most severe parts and is severe, then puncture around the ankle joint as if rotating, puncture at those two lines.</start_of_turn
And if the pain remains in the said places, then puncture around the ankle joint over each bone and over the base of the thumb.</start_of_turn
And if the pain persists for several days around the joints or muscles, then cauterize the entire area of the assistants.</start_of_turn
Do not evacuate the patient hastily but with good management and medication, for if good management and swelling subside, this cautery alone will suffice, God willing.</start_of_turn
(The text continues with additional medical instructions and observations.)</start_of_turn
On cauterization of fractures.</start_of_turn
When a fracture has occurred in the ankle and saying the bones are displaced from the joint to the genu, and when this starts to happen, then command the patient to lie still in the bed and use soft cushions so that the wound does not open from the belly.</start_of_turn
And follow the patient closely between your legs about the bed, and command them to keep their leg elevated until the bone is set or the swelling or wound disappears.</start_of_turn
And return the one who has been mentioned above and secure the fracture over the fifth metatarsal with a signal similar to the half moon of the circle that is at the base of the limb.</start_of_turn
And thus is the form of the cautery.</start_of_turn
Until it is neither red nor black.</start_of_turn Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.</start_of_turn
You have already opened the space between the patient’s thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.</start_of_turn
And thus suspend the cautery over that signal with your hand over the cautery, and do this until you see the fifth metatarsal bone inside the ankle joint; repeat this for the other ankle if you have not achieved it in the first attempt within the bone.</start_of_turn
Observe diligently the color of the tissue during the cauterization, so that you do not burn the patient so that no great evil results from the treatment.</start_of_turn
The physician must be cautious when using the cautery and not burn the patient's bones, for this would impair the success of the operation.
The physician must take great care when using the cautery, according to the size and measure of the children's bones
And keep the area of the cautery clean for three days, until the burn mark has healed
And care for those who are with you until they are well
The patient should rest on the bed for two days before the wound and the bruise are sealed
And care that they abstain from food according to the length of time of their recovery, so that their belly does not suffer from excessive exertion during the healing process.
When they are ready to be taken away after about twenty days, give them nourishing food appropriately, and keep them like that for another twenty days.
Remember work, food, drink and rest, for when you use this regimen of care, the whole patient will recover well
And I say the care for ruptures in other parts of the belly, and so at the beginning, and you must not move, for when you burn the rupture of that part round according to its quantity, that which is extruded from the corden as much as the third part of it; and care for that which has been said, and do not do it carelessly.
And I have already said that the first thing is to burn the rupture with a triangular cautery in this way, because it is marked with a handle:
and is stopped in line that lies over the width of the foot and under the rupture, and another line below; and place your hand with a cautery claw above the first cautery, for the first cautery is more acute and better
Chapter 46.</start_of_turn>
Of the cautery of the ankle.
When the limb is affected either by accident or by blow and the pain persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then it is necessary to burn with a pointed cautery
And the cautery of the whole limb according to the magnitude and the smallness of it, the hardness and softness of it, the location of the ankle and the pain of it
Therefore if the patient is well from the first cautery, it is not necessary; but if not, then repeat the cautery; for from these pains it often happens that the parts near that part of the limb become painful, so that you must consider those which are adjacent to the one which you have just cauterized until the patient is well
Chapter 47.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of leprosy
The books many times advise to burn with a cautery for great benefit, but management if the species of leprosy which is useful for the corruption of phlegm and melancholy
And therefore when you want to burn it, consider if the leprosy is common or if it has been cured with what we have said in the division and not from that, and fear about the patient that the corruption includes all the parts of the body and all the completeness of it, then burn it over the head with two cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and one at the back of the head, towards the eyebrows; and two on the cheeks; and one behind, on the nape of the neck or on the shoulder
And finally place your hand over the cautery for a little while until it makes a small imprint in the bone, and when the scabs are loosened from it, so that the emission of thick vapors is alleviated from it; and burn over the heel as required.</start_of_turn>
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and appears evident, then it is necessary that you burn with those cauteries which we have said in the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two upper cheeks, and two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and five cauteries on the vertebrae of the chest, and one large one on the vertebrae near the breastbone, one on the breastbone, and two on the ankles, and two on the muscles, and two on the tendons of the feet; and burn those which are over all the joints of the toes and feet, and over any bone of the feet, and over the wisdom teeth of the patient.</start_of_turn
And beware of the nerves which are above the heel that you do not burn those.</start_of_turn
Each vein is cauterized with a cautery on the ankle bone and on the mouth of the stomach, and on the heel.
You know that the more veins you cauterize, the more relief and the more comfortable the patient will be; and you know that the patient does not feel pain in the cautery, just as before, because the body is already stunned.
And you should know that the cauteries should be large or small according to the members and the joints according to what precedes the species of the instruments
And take care of the cautery with flour of sponges and wax and with the other care until it is healed

Of cautery for stunning
When any limb is stiff or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that stiff limb with a cautery according to the greatness of the limb or the smallness of it.
And do the same with the heel cauterizing slightly through the thickness of the heel bone a little bit And take care of that until it is healed
And some veins are cauterized each one that has to the knees and the toes, and the vertebrae of the buttocks and you see the sensation of the nerves that are leaving that limb, and is remauged the stupor.
Do not presume more than what is known about the anatomy of the limb and the exit of the nerves throughout the body moving

Of cautery of boils that are dissolving
When boils are old and do not yield to the treatment of medicines, then you cauterize over that with a cautery beforehand a little bit according to the quantity of the thickness of the heel until the whiteness and the color of it is changed, and the color of it is changed
And take care of that with sponges and lentils with olive oil and rosemary leaves, with columb or vinegar, giving each a little bit and mixing them all together, and put on a bandage and hold their place until it is healed

Of cautery of cancer
When cancer begins and is seen in that limb, then you cauterize that which is around the circumference of it even if it is revolted
And the learned ones say that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle; but to me it does not seem so, because I have seen that some veins are ulcerated in this way.
It is more prudent to cauterize in the circumference of it as we have said, or with many cauteries

Of cautery of tumors
When some tumors are delayed in maturity, and this is because of the excess of humors that cause that, or for the state of the patient, who is old in decrepitude, or for the time, and you want to hasten the maturity of the tumors; then you cauterize in the circumference of them with many small punctures; and you should know that that which fastens the maturity of the tumors
You should also know that if you want to pierce them with the cautery, the way to do this is to ignite the cautery of which this is the way: and stop that in the middle of the tumors until it penetrates the bone.
And if you do it in that place that is more left, to relieve the limb; and take care of that until it is healed
End of Book
Of cautery of caries
Caries is a mobile corruption in the limb, which consumes that as if it were fire eating dry wood
Therefore if sometimes that caries is in the place where you suffer the cautery with fire, then you ignite the cautery with nails many or few as it is convenient in that place where it is caries
And take care of that of all parts until you eradicate all the corruption and there remains no cause of it.
And keep the cauterized area covered for three days, and pause over the burnt parts while sprinkling them with a mixture of olive oil until the wounds are completely erased and all the corruption has gone.
And take care of the one who has the swelling that causes the pain.
Maybe three times a day that the wound will heal without corruption, is not good; but if so, do it again with the cautery over the parts that are corrupted
And the most of these doctors do not know any remedies for acute cases, except for the cautery itself However, the fire of the cautery is of great utility in healing the wound
And I have already said that the care of these acute cases is in the division, and therefore take them when you have finished with these.

Of cautery of nails and of other similar things.
Many veins of the foot suffer from the disease which is called claw, and this is a great cause of suffering, and it is caused by the swelling of the foot; and the cautery is done in two ways, with fire and with cold water
The fire of the cautery is more fierce than that of a flame that resembles punishment, and that should be performed with a tool of iron according to the quantity of the claw contained in each part, and of slight scratches.
And keep the fire away from the claw, and turn your hand over the cautery so that the cautery reaches the depth of the claw And keep the cauterized area covered for three days until it starts to scab over And put on a plaster over the wound which has been scraped out with salt, and keep the plaster on for a night, for that will cause the wound to be eradicated from its root
And take care of the part with the swelling that is caused by the generation of the flesh until it is healed
And if it does not heal, and many veins have burst on the surface of the body, mostly in the legs and feet, then you must take care that you administer the cautery with cold water, that is to say, take a bundle of wool or iron or something similar and keep that on the claw; and pour a little cold water over the bundle and hold your hand over it, and press against the margin of the bundle against the root of the claw, and keep the cold water away from the root of the claw; and wait for the patient for a little while for the pain of the cold water to pass away from the root of the claw.
And thus be with those and do the same with the others until you come over all of them
And take care of those humors that remain in the root of the claws so that they are eradicated with the swelling of the flesh which they cause

Of cautery of tremors
When there is a tremor due to cold in the nerves or for feverish cause, or for any other cause of a similar kind, then you must cauterize that four times over the vertebrae or over the bones of the two thighs, between each vertebra with a cautery; and over the legs and over the chest, with olive oil.

When there are split wounds in the body, and pus-filled blisters which are caused by corrupt matter; therefore, at the beginning when they appear, you must cauterize over the head of the fistula with a pointed cautery of iron or of mercury, the extremity of which is extended over the fire; or with long tweezers; or with a slow cautery
And with some others it is necessary to cauterize immediately at the beginning of their discharge in this manner; and do not be afraid, for the superfluous matter is interrupted by these, and they are healed of these
However, you must cover that it is useful for the evacuation with a tube of flebotomy

Of cautery of the flux of urine from an accidental incision of the bladder.
Too many veins engorge with blood, which originates from the plague which causes swelling, or from the beginning of abscesses or cautery of the limb, and consequently, it is difficult to control it.
Therefore, when such an accident occurs, then immediately take hold of the limb with your hand over the area of the swelling, and rest until the blood flow in the limb subsides, and do not move it.</end_of_turn>
And immediately stop the bleeding from the cautery with a few coarse and fine sponges, by name of God, and cover over them until they are no longer on fire.</end_of_turn>
And immediately take from those a little or a great amount according to the location and the swelling of the artery, over that vein urgently holding back that blood flow until it is stopped and relaxed that limb.</end_of_turn
And if the limb is expelled from the orifice of the artery while you are holding it back and squeezing the cautery, then take another cautery immediately placed alongside the previous ones that are in the fire, and do not stop until the limb is restored.</end_of_turn>
Beware that you do not burn the nerves that are here, and that you do not cause any further harm to the patient.</end_of_turn>
And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to restrict the limb, especially when the artery is large, unless one of four things is done: either cauterize it as said above, or extract it if it is not extracted, or when it is extracted the parts of the limb are burned and the limb is relaxed, or that it is bound securely with a thread or bandage to strengthen the structure, or that it is treated with medicines whose virtue is to restrict the limb; and that it is bound tightly with a cushion or constriction downwards.</end_of_turn>
May he who gives tight restriction downwards from the thread or bandage and from the stricture of the drape or position of the cause of the burning and of the swelling not cause pain, but rather comfort.</end_of_turn
May he who is present not be the physician or the medicine, but may he understand immediately by the indication of this hand over the orifice of that vein as we have said, and take great care that the limb is completely freed from the swelling, and that the artery is not squeezed; and that over the artery be poured with cold water of great coldness until the limb is solidified and engorged; and may he take care that there must be cautery or medicine necessary.</end_of_turn
Of incisions and perforations and winds and of phlebitis and of plagues and of their appearances.</end_of_turn
We have already said in the first chapter that cautery with fire is convenient and medicinal in many diseases, and the occasions and causes of these, and the instruments necessary for these forms of cautery; and we have ordered the chapters of this section from the thighs downwards.</end_of_turn
And I will proceed in this chapter with that same method, so that what is required may be remedied, when it is necessary.</end_of_turn
And behold that I begin, brother, that in this chapter is for fear that which is in the first chapter of cautery.</end_of_turn
And for that reason I must warn you that in this chapter great caution is necessary, because in the operation which is in this chapter many veins are engorged with blood, which threatens the life of the limb due to the bursting of the vein or the incision over the abscess or the emergence of pus or the pure of the plague or the extraction of a splinter or the incision of a stone or other similar things.</end_of_turn And all these things are accompanied by fear and tremor and in most of them death.</end>
And I warn you that you must not be overcome by fear in this matter, because some veins are more dangerous than others in cases of diseases.</end_of_turn And it is because of these things that some people will die from their disease, and it is easy for them to die from their disease, and they will be overcome with fear of the disease itself and of its duration, and of the fear of death which it signifies.</end_of_turn
And thus I have said to you, you must hope for that health, and your ailment is pernicious.
Therefore do not consent to any of those things which are mentioned; and your caution should be greater than your desire, and your fear should be great; and do not presume any cause except for that which you know for certain is beneficial to you and to which success you are accustomed.</end_of_turn>
E use in the care of all those patients with uncertain prognosis and indication of whom it is that health is converted, because in that case it is up to you to assist in acquiring fame and glory, of the praise and honor.
Oh, son of God, God be with you and understand you, and do not fear my words and protection, for it is in your hand.</end_of_turn>
And I order this chapter to be distinguished by chapters according as it follows in the chapter of cautery, of the care of the head inwards to the feet, for that it may be alleviated for you what you demand of what you have need.</end_of_turn
First chapter.</end_of_turn>
Of the care of water which is contained in the head of children.</end_of_turn
Wise men say that this disease often appears in children at the time of teething, and when the nurse washes the child's head, his life is saved.</end_of_turn
And many times the cause of these fevers is unknown.</end_of_turn
I have not seen this disease except in children; and of all those whom I have seen, many have died, and for this reason I leave this work undone in them.</end_of_turn
And I have seen that a child whose head was full of water, the head of which was always enlarged until cessation could not bear it any longer due to the greatness of the head, and more that the humidity increased until it caused death.</end_of_turn
Or this humidity is added between the marrow and the bone, or is added outside the bones on the head.</end_of_turn
For if the humidity is between the marrow and the bone and the swelling is slight, when you make the incision in the middle of the head with a fissure in the breadth, and the length of the fissure is two lines until the humidity runs out, this is the form of the spasm.</end_of_turn
And therefore if the humidity is greatly increased and the swelling is great, here are two incisions according to this manner:</end_of_turn
And if the humidity is outside the bones, a sign of this is that sometimes you have eaten too much of the head and the water is squeezed out when you compress it with your thumb against the parts inwards and it is not that which you have hidden.</end_of_turn For you must make three incisions in the middle of the head according to this manner:</end_of_turn
Then extract all the humidity from the incision; and strengthen the incisions with strips and gauze; and pour oil over it from above and olive oil inside for five days; and remove the ligament and care for the wound with attempts and compresses, and strengthen the head equally; and feed the patient with dry food of little humidity until the limb is comfortable and healthy.</end_of_turn
There is another method of incision, which considers the magnitude of the swelling and the collection of the water, for some fevers are greater in the occipital region, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore attend to the incision where the swelling appears and the accumulation of water, and do the incision as well as you can.</end_of_turn
And note that you must not incision the artery, and if there is flowing blood of health evacuate the humidity along with it. Keep the patient still for that flow of blood with the evacuation of humidity.</end_of_turn
Third chapter.</end_of_turn
When we see a catarrh or swelling in the limbs or feet, and the fever has passed, and we do not trust in the cure of medicines, the best cure in this case is the incision of those two arteries.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you want to make the incision, let the patient raise his head as much as he can, and press the area around the area with your rough hand so that the arteries appear, and strengthen the patient's neck with something; and consider where the vein is; and the places where some of the veins which are near the heels are depressed, and hide them as much as possible.</end_of_turn
And take care that the wound is not too wide; and make incisions of any sharp object in the area of the wound that reaches the bone, and that the incision is of the breadth of the head.</end_of_turn
If you wish, I will enter the sputum and obstruct the artery, thereby relieving the pain at the source.
The length of the incision should be two fingers' breadth, for when any vein is cut, the blood vessel escapes with a pulsatile swelling, which leaps forth by frequent jumps.</end_of_turn>
If the artery does not appear at the incision, nevertheless measure three fingers' breadth of the surrounding space, and with your fingers grasp firmly, and then enter into the bone.</end_of_turn>
And what you must take from the blood vessel is the amount of one unc.</end_of_turn But do not take too much or too little, but only as much as appears from the severity of the pain and the filling of the artery.</end_of_turn
And consider the plague, and therefore if there remains any cause of swelling on the bone, then cut away that which may cause subsequent swelling.</end_of_turn
And strengthen the swelling with sponges and linen bandages, and care for that which is inside until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.</end_of_turn
When in ancient times or in our days some violent accident occurs, either by agricultural humidity or by the quality of the lacerations of the temples, or even an old wound that resembles these, and these are not remedied by the methods of healing medicine, then we must resort to the extraction of the arteries of the temples or to their cauterization as we have shown.</end_of_turn
And the manner of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient is placed on the bed of the temple from which the pain arises; and understand that the visible artery in the temple is the one which is shown by the physician, and the hidden one is only known in a few individuals due to its great ferocity.</end_of_turn
And if it is hidden, then strengthen the patient with some support; and frequently moisten the area with a rough sponge or evaporate the area with lukewarm water until the visible artery appears.</end_of_turn And now you take the sputum as follows: And with your fingers grasp the tendon at that point which makes it easier for you to reach the artery; and withdraw it from that side and extract that from the surrounding parts until you have extracted that from the tendon and uncovered that from the surrounding tunicas which are left behind.</end_of_turn
If the artery is slender, then wrap that part around the nail; and cut away a part of that according to the extent to which the patient's limbs are swollen and contracted, and do not cause the blood to flow, for if it is not cut it will not be healed.</end_of_turn
And evacuate from the blood vessel one unc.</end_of_turn And so on to three.</end_of_turn
If the artery is large, then cover that in two places with strong doubled linen or strong cords, and do not bind it up so as to putrefy it before the swelling is consolidated and to cause the blood to flow.</end>
And cut away the excess which is between two ligaments; and do that in this hour or wait a while.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize that which is cut at the bone which is cut around until the limbs are healed, and leave in place instead of that make this work.</end_of_turn
And it is better if the patient has a fever or is of scaly complexion; for those causes help the drying humors.</end_of_turn>
And cover in this way the extraction of the arteries that you see in the ankle, and rest them over soft powders sufficiently to make them painless, and care for them with dry medicines which make the flesh swell and the swelling subside until they are healed.</end_of_turn
And if while working you see that the blood flow of the artery is endangered, then you must immediately restrict that blood flow, either by cutting or by cauterizing, or by filling the ankle with something, and strengthen your hand until the blood flow is restored.</end_of_turn And if none of these causes are present, then pause for a moment in that place until the blood has solidified, and then moisten the area with lukewarm water of great cold until the pain subsides, and strengthen as before.</end_of_turn
And thus when the cautery has pierced the vein at this point, having made two holes, because you have marked the two points at the attempt, and having withdrawn somewhat, without causing any spark, until it reaches the bone and divides the vein into two, so that the space between the extremities is prolonged, which is not consolidated by this cautery.
This is the method of cautery:
And the sharpness of the two holes is sufficient. However, if the hole is made with less sharpness than two, it is better, because if it is made too sharp it will burn the flesh too quickly
Therefore, when there is any thickness, the heat of the fire must be regulated in these and the flesh is split apart eagerly
This work is better in all works and lighter
And the space between the two holes is the quantity of the thickness of the finger

Of the care of the limbs affected by the acute and acidic humors of the ulcers.
When the acidic ulcers exist, and the limbs affected by these veins are above the cap of the femur, do not interfere with any medical treatment for fear of causing further damage, for the face of the patient often swells up and hangs down like ants, and the limbs are extended, wet because their humors have become known, and the nails are scaled by the sharpness of the tears, which are more useful in the treatment of these ulcers than any previous treatment.
And you command the patient to draw out the humors from the front of the thighs, and immediately make three incisions of equal distance according to the length of the front If the length of the incision is two fingers: one incision should be of equal distance to the length of the nose in the middle of the front, and the second according to the length from the tears which are in the lacrimal, and the third from the other side
Beware of the cutting of the arteries which are in two layers, and lengthen your hand from the continuation of both mandibles And if the space between any incision is the quantity of three fingers adjusted
And if you have a piece of sponge or dry cloth, moisten it with these which you will use to cover the wound
And immediately insert between the two acute extremities, in which this is the form of the incision of them: that from the part below the temples to the second incision Excise from that whole the tendon which is between the two incisions over the bone, and immediately do the same with the incision which is further on. And immediately stretch this sponge and insert in the first incision another instrument which is called cutellar, sharp from one side and blunt from the other side
And stop the bleeding from that sharp point which is adjacent to the tendon, and the veins which are beyond the bone, and fill up that until it reaches the further incision, and cut through everything until the veins are severed
And continue the incision until after the tendon, and immediately do the same with the further incision
And when the wound has bled enough, express the parts of the wound closed with a bandage.
And immediately put on a coarse cloth on each incision, and cover those particles with oil and wine and vinegar, and anything else which does not stick to the scab.
And on the third day remove the ligament and give great abundance of lukewarm water or tepid, and care for it with ointment of beeswax with olive oil and other things until the sores are healed.
Chapter 5
Of the care of the tears which descend from the parts behind the head
When there are acute and continuous catarrh and sometimes the limbs of the patient extend slightly, and it is already necessary to take care of them, and the ulcerated palpebras cause pain in the front of the head, acute and sudden, due to these accidents the matter and the catarrh do not flow but from small veins of the parts proceeding from the back
The best cure for these is to command the patient to yawn widely, and then insert a needle at the middle of the forehead, a little for the width (and begin at the left temporal opening to the right temporal opening; and be sure to puncture the bone; and pull out your hand from the tears of the temples which are made by chewing).
Dry all the area around the wound with sponge or dry cloth and then fill the space between the two lips of the wound with old cloth or strips of cloth. And then apply dust from belladonna in vinegar and oil to prevent excessive bleeding.<end_turn>
And when you have finished and you see that the bleeding has decreased, then cover the bone until it begins to harden, and then care for that which regulates the excessive bleeding, which makes the wound swell, as if you were taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mixing them together. Or, make a plaster of these and apply it to the wound when it has stopped bleeding.<end_turn>
Chapter VI.<end_turn>
Of the care for that which comes down to the ankles.
Every cause that comes down to the ankles is one of four species, which is either mineral stone or something similar to stone, such as iron and gravel, or of plant origin such as ivy or hemp, or is due to a flowing liquid such as vinegar and wine, or any beast.
And therefore when stone comes down to the ankle or any other cause similar to these does not cause swelling or pain in the ankle, and if sometimes the stone does cause swelling, then distil in that case oil of violets or chamomile, and apply the extraction to it, and make it vomit, and bandage the area around the event of vomiting. And then pause the movement of the ankle with some pieces of wool or bandage, and extend the ankle to its parts, because swelling caused by these causes is easily separated from these parts.<end_turn
And if it is not separated, then apply the extraction to it with the instrument called gesti epicicarios subtle of which this is the form:
And if it is separated by the epicicary, it is good; otherwise, apply the extraction with little duplication of the dose.
Therefore, if it is not separated by the liquid, then make a needle of gut and insert the extremity of the needle into the ankle joint and close around the needle with wax and oil to prevent it from being broken except for the needle itself.<end_turn> And then extract with the strong attraction of the bowels, which cause swelling like the liquid that we have mentioned.<end_turn
Maybe if it is not separated in this way, then take from the burnt or from the black appearance that appears in the ankle, as much as a thumb, and keep that in the extremity of the ray, and then wrap around that area appropriately stopped.<end_turn And then insert that into the ankle joint with ease, and then dry the ankle from the humidity.<end_turn
Therefore, if it is not separated by all the causes that we have mentioned, then you must resort to cutting off that which causes excessive bleeding or spasm.<end_turn>
And the manner of cutting off that which is to be done is that you at first bind the patient’s ankle of the vein sephasica and extract from the disease according to the virtue of the thing, and then make that desist between your hands and convert the ankle to its parts, and make a small fissure at the root of the ankle just before the bone is fractured.<end_turn><end_turn> And the fracture should be of a crescent shape until it reaches the stone, and when the stone is grasped, hold that back if you can with appropriate instruments; and then close the fracture at that moment with speed, and care for that until it is healed.<end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
And if the cause of the swelling in the ankle is one of the fatty substances that swells and inflates, then apply the cure and the extraction of the thing; even if it does not obey your order immediately, take some sponge that is subtle in this way: And administer with that the incision of that fat which is caused in the ankle.<end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
Do not hesitate when you think that that is already moistened by the vapor of the ankle, and keep that in large pieces, and extract with nails or with subtle instruments, or by incision as we have said, because the extraction is alleviated in this way.<end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
When the water which is introduced into the heel covers the disease at its commencement, and fills the sole of the heel with a little old dust, I sprinkle over that heel the water which is there, and if by that it is not sufficient, take as many pebbles as are necessary and as long as the finger reaches, and burn them in the fire a little, and let the patient put one of those pebbles into the cavity of the heel and jump on the other foot beside that part and strike with another pebble upon the pebble which is under the heel. Therefore do not stop adding water until all the water has been squeezed out.
Therefore do not stop adding water until all the water has been squeezed out. And when the water has been squeezed out, take paper or lint to dry it off And put one extremity of the foot into the heel and extend the other extremity over the fire until the greater part of the foot is consumed by the flame.
And put another lint there and do the same with water as many times as necessary until all the water has been squeezed out, and then take out that which is called the outlying stone with a needle as soon as it is detached
When the beast enters into that heel, if it is of small size, hold it and keep it still, for that is how we have said in the division; but if it is of great size which causes pain at the same time, then administer the extraction of it with hands and nails, and the cause of it is less serious than all the other causes which cause pain in the heel.
When the worm has been engendered in the heel, when you have cured that which we have said in the division and in the treatise of distillations, and do not neglect your treatment, then cover that you may protect the heel from the sun
And therefore if any cause of the worms appears, then extract that with hands or nails subtle, but if no cause appears, then take a needle and stretch it out wide from which this is the shape of it: And put the pointed extremity into the heel according to the quantity which the patient suffers because of the disease; and then press down with that against that for a strong suction, and do the same with water, until all the worms have been squeezed out
If you do not obey my advice, then I will put you under oath and close the opening of the needle with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which have already been mentioned in the treatment of the worms, and you will find them in the treatise of distillations
And be attentive to the effusion which proceeds from the medicines which are applied to the heel with this instrument of which this is the shape And make a hole of silver or lead, wide and deep, with a little hole at the bottom
Therefore be careful so that it is in the hollow of the needle of containment here where it is necessary. And if you wish, take the sponge and wrap it around the foot adequately with the toe, and then pour oil into the hollow of the heel, or juice of any herb, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the needle — which is in the heel — and then insert the sponge with the toe and press with your hand that which is pressing temperately from within until the oil is expelled from the hollow of the heel and the patient sits on the oil that is left behind.
And that which is infused into the heel is already scorched with fire a little Beware that the cause which you distill in the heel is not too hot, because the medicines for the heel cannot endure it
Chapter VII.</end_of_turn>
Of the treatment of the blistering of the heel.
Some ointments for children and adults who suffer from large swellings on their feet are useful for blisters not caused by wounds; and that which already exists in some men, blistering of the heel by pressure or by nothing in particular; and this blistering is useful in many cases for the prevention of the swelling of the heel which does not happen in other cases, and in others in the outer parts
And that which happens in the groin of the heel, which does not happen in other cases, is in the greatest degree of difficult healing
And when you have achieved it, cover the heel of the patient from the disease to the sole of the foot and rest it in that place Therefore if sometimes there appears an apparent blistering, open that with a sponge of the shape of which we have said
If the extremity of the foot in which it is small in size, of which one part is acute and the other is not; and the sponge is of two lion’s feet so that it does not harm the heel
Therefore, if the operation is for a wound that has been born in the heel or in the meat of the limb, then do so with fine needles and pierce that area with such gentleness that all the surrounding tissue remains intact.
If the operation is in the groin of the heel, then take fine needles and prick that area a little deeper, and then place that in the meat of the heel.
Therefore, if you smell infection in that which the patient finds relief with ease, because of the gravity of the situation, force the pressure away with ease; and take care that you do not injure the nerves of the heel
And so pause in the heel above the amount of the width of the wound which you have covered with Egyptian unguent; and do so for several days until you are sure of the consolidation of the wound; or that you take some and put that into vinegar and powder over it and use of it; and if sometimes the heel has already been healed, then stretch the one which you have covered with silk until the other one which you have covered with cotton is taut; and do so until the pus has gone; and care for it until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
May be blood flows from the wound; then immerse sponge or cloth in cold water and place over the heel, and use the other remedy which restricts the flow of blood, which is mentioned in the treatise on distillation.</end_of_turn>

Of the treatment of the swelling which we owe to the eyelids.</end_of_turn>
The swellings which we owe to the eyelids are some moist and some dry.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must have those with thumb nails or nails on, and scratch those with the tip of your nails, and then pause over the area which has been scratched.</end_of_turn
And if there is pain with the flow of blood, then you cauterize those which are black with a fine needle.</end_of_turn
And the best cauterization is when the small veins and blood vessels return when the cause of those veins has been removed; and when they are cauterized with fire, those veins are consumed and do not return.</end_of_turn

Treatment for the great swelling which occurs in the eyelids.</end_of_turn
Moist veins swell in the eyelids because of any cause which makes them strong and rigid, and for this reason it is called great swelling.</end_of_turn
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the eyelid outwards and downwards.</end_of_turn
Therefore, in their treatment, you must consider if the swelling comes from the outside of the eyelid and is widespread; and the cause of it is slight.</end_of_turn
Therefore, make an incision for the width, and with ease drain that from all sides until it is evacuated, and then suspend that which is on the surface and cut that.</end_of_turn
And if the figure is large, then you adjust it with stitches; and care for that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if it is slight, it will not cause any harm if you leave the blood of the wound to restore it and make it firm.</end_of_turn
And if the swelling is receding towards the margins of the eyelid, you must strip the surface of the margin, then remove the eyelid and suspend the swelling with a bandage; otherwise you will digest the incision, and take that from all sides, and if the eyelid is perforated by the incision it will not be noticed in any way.</end_of_turn
And finally, after the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and care for the area until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter X.</end_of_turn
Of the care of the outside of the eyelid which is under the eye.</end>
The outside of the eyelid which is under the eye is gray due to the humors which are generated in the layers of the eyelid, and especially in children, it makes the eyes dark and prevents them from seeing the sunlight because the tears are trapped by these.</end_of_turn
And thus they sometimes speak of faces that are always chattering, and of faces that are always sleeping; and upon their eyelids they leave their eyebrows wet, which have already covered the inflammation, and the imminent threat of swelling appears in the eye; and when you press on the area around the belly, they say that the swelling extends within.
Every way of operating is in that one in whom the patient holds their head down in the belly, and they make them drink and swallow calmly, and make them circle according to the quantity which contains the whole of the joints, and they make them circle over that and press on the area around the belly saying that it is added there in order to accumulate swelling in the middle of the circle, and they make them breathe in the middle of that moisture as it descends upon the wound for its width, and the wound should not be larger than the wound that is made in phlegmatique swelling.
Maybe in the groin you should make an opening that extends throughout the whole belly so that you can reach the joints, because in these days the process of the joints goes through a wound according to the shape of white fat
Therefore extract that which you have wrapped which you have enveloped between the thighs which you call the buttocks and revolve between the right and left hand until it is dispersed.
And keep in mind that you must not tighten the wound in order that the moisture does not reach the bone and loosen that one.
Maybe if you do not see the joints at the beginning of the wound, maybe you should tighten the wound a little bit so that the process of the joints can take place; and then extract that which we have said; and then wash the wound with water and wine and apply pressure over the area and rest those which are powdered
And thus when you have finished salt and you have paused that in the cavity of the wound so that what remains of that moisture.
And take care of that until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Maybe if by chance it happens in the area around the belly after cautery, the hours will cure that when plastering bandages are placed until it is healed.

Methods of treatment of the bone.
When in the eyelids of the eyes there is a natural swelling, so that the natural tears flow, the hours say that these are related to the bone and cause various methods of diseases like excessive tears and the softening of the eyelids and membrane between which there is a cause of destruction of the bone that is called tauten of the bone, and it is cured in four ways: or by cautery with fire; or by acute medicine as it is said in the chapter of cautery; or it is sufficient to attach by incision and suture; or by cannas as I will say
And therefore you must hold the patient’s head down in the belly; convert the upper eyelid of the eye to your left hand, and if it is converted, no; but if not, prick in the place where there is fidelity of the limb beyond the edge of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate through the fidelity that is below, and that which is — from the margin of the eyelid in which you can see tears — from the margins, and pull the thread from the limb to the eyelid, and convert that which is above to the edge.
And thus extract the thread and pause the eyelids so that the tear of the lacrimal major descends into the lacrimal minor; and pull out the thread and leave the eyelids slightly covered with small pieces of lint or gauze, and place again over the eyelid with tension, and so as a leaf of myrtle.
However, keep in mind that the figure must be according to the quantity of elevation of the eyelid, for in men it is different, for in them who indicate that it must be incised from the great quantity of the eyelid according to the quantity for which the eyelid is softened
And thus make the wound over the two lines which you have marked, and begin from the lacrimal major into the lacrimal minor. And if your wound is like the natural ones like that of the king.
And thus put on the sponge in one of the two angles of the belly, and then remove that whole thing, and adjust with the suture the two lips towards the belly or with fine thread, and remove the excess, and apply adhesion to that which is superabundant from the strings over two eyebrows with some causes which you wish, or do not cure.</start_of_turn>
And thus read the suture of the strings within three days or four, and then cure that.</start_of_turn>
And if you wish, leave the dressing unsutured, and cure that which exudes and contracts, for the eyelid is relieved behind the sealing of the dressing and the accumulation of them; but it is better not to suture and so I say to the ancient ones to abstain from tauting.</start_of_turn>
May the emperor himself be solicitous about the patient, for it is a good operation, and there is no reason to fear it.
And it is another manner to test, that the sign on the eyelid is like a twig of Myrtle, and raise the eyelid three times with your fingers spread out as follows: ...
If this is not possible, have the nails grasped, and if they are not blunt, take a needle with a thread and pass it through the middle of the sign, and bring out the other thread beside the greater lacrimal, and the thread beside the smaller lacrimal below, and adjust between the teeth saying that the nails are equal, and then raise your hand as high as the elevation equal, raise the whole leg on which the sign is made as we have recommended
And then suture the two lips of the wound together, and care for that which is healed.
If by chance the afterbirth happens, you must leave the incision or the fissure open, cover it with fat, and keep it moist.</start_of_turn>
Every woman who has seen her eyelids become swollen from the swelling of the veins should be treated as if she had an incision; indeed you must use what we have said about the incision in this case; do not suture in any place where it is not necessary.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary to ligate the veins in this way: ... And you must convert the eyelid and split the figure as I have recounted; and then take two needles or two fine threads of which the length is according to the length of the eyelid and the width is less than the width of the pupil.</start_of_turn You have already made an incision at the extremities of each part where you have the thread.</start_of_turn
Then add something subtle about the excess that remains from the eyelid of the patient, and tighten the veins of each part with great stricture, and leave that for a few days, for the limb that is subjected to the stricture will be pale and will become necrosed if left closed.</start_of_turn
If it is delayed, then break the ligature at the ankles, and care for the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn
When it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the veins do not swell.</start_of_turn
This is the way to ligate two veins in this way: ...</start_of_turn And there must be the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.</start_of_turn

From the elevation of the veins in the patient's eyelid with a needle when the skin is hard.</start_of_turn
When they are unnatural, hard, rough and painful, the custom of the operation in them is that you take a fine needle and hold it in the middle of the fold of skin and bone, and that you adjust the extremities so that they are neither too tight nor too loose.</start_of_turn And the length of the thread should be that of a palm.</start_of_turn
And then take another fine thread and leave it short, and tie the extremities of the former one if you wish.</start_of_turn
And then place the patient's face downwards towards the sun, so that your work may be declared, for it is a subtle and small operation.</start_of_turn
And then insert the needle at the root of the skin that has needed to be sutured, and make it penetrate the eyelid firmly until you have extracted the foreign matter from the natural skin.</start_of_turn
And then draw the skin inwards and insert it into the gauze, and keep it there for one or two or three and no more.</start_of_turn
And then withdraw your hand from that which is outside and bring out the skin from the natural part of the eyelid with the gauze.</start_of_turn
If the gauze is thick and is not withdrawn from the skin, you will withdraw the gauze from the parts beyond the thread which you have placed in that way, until the gauze is withdrawn from the wound itself.</start_of_turn
And so concerning the vision of the patient, because you have ligated the gauze and the thread, and because you have caused him to cough and sneeze, and because you have left him closed for two or three days, until the skin adheres to the place and appears over the wound itself.</start_of_turn
If the hair is scanty, adjust the length of the hair to that which is natural, and elevate it at that point, or until it reaches the desired space, and then elevate that point.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn>
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.</start_of_turn
When swelling appears in the heel and is drawn towards the sole of the foot, when it is contracted, it is an indication of poor consolidation of pus or a cut or burn, and is called leporine. This swelling can be either natural or accidental, and is useful for consolidating pus or cuts or burns, or for preventing them from becoming worse.</start_of_turn
The manner of performing the operation is that you make an incision to consolidate the swelling and separate the layers of tissue, and rest in them at the point where there is a piece of soft tissue between them, and join them once they are healed.</start_of_turn
And do not neglect the care of the cause of the swelling, which is constriction; for if you do not do this, the swelling will return more vigorously than before.</start_of_turn
Use in this case what softens the swelling such as fennel, and soak in the water in which they are kept high and seeds of rue, or vinegar, which is liquefied with some oil, and immerse in this the area, and care for it.</start_of_turn
And the key to your care is that you perforate only as much as is necessary to consolidate according to the form in which it began.</start_of_turn
And this operation that we have mentioned is nothing other than the rectification of swelling that does not restore the shape of the limb as it was before.</start_of_turn

On the care of swelling that is useful for the heel.
This swelling that is useful for the heel is truly called vertadiner swelling; and it is either natural or accidental.</start_of_turn>
Accidental swelling is useful for pus or for a cut or for a burn or for other similar things.</start_of_turn
The way to perform the operation is that you take a needle with which you make a double loop, and keep that in the flesh, and that you pass the loop from the left lacrimal duct into the right lacrimal duct, until the loop reaches the two extremities of the flesh.</start_of_turn
Then stretch the flesh outwards with the needle and hold that with the needle, and make an incision at a wide point.</start_of_turn And therefore if you restore the shape of the heel as it should be, that is good; but if not, take a thread and stop that in the indented shape, and with that restore the heel, and close the two wounds on the side of the heel.</start_of_turn
And the extremities of the two wounds should be at a right angle to the incision, which has been useful until they converge, and that their angle should be such that when they converge they form a useful figure.</start_of_turn
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.</start_of_turn
And keep the flesh that surrounds the heel as wide as the width of the heel itself, so that you do not damage the heel.</start_of_turn
And adjust the separated parts and sew them with a thread; and take care of them as we have said of the soothing medicines and the bandages that should be put on when it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the swelling has to depart for a tear or suture or burn, then you must make an incision on the flat surface of the heel according to what has gone before.</start_of_turn And separate the nail between two layers as we have said.</start_of_turn
In the sum of the discourse concerning the care of swelling when it is detached or of the heel, that it be carried out in the operation according to the way in which the swelling is prepared, and that is in the form of diverse motas.</start_of_turn
And the learned surgeons always prepare some instrument in any way possible so that they can restore the figure to its natural shape, or to a similar one, and that the patient may benefit from the operation and the instruments at their disposal.</start_of_turn

From the adherence of the palpebra to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this adhesion occurs among many men, that is, when the palpebra becomes solidified both below and above the limb, and is forbidden from its natural movements, therefore you must move away the rays that are causing this adhesion, and elevate them upwards or stretch them outwards with the thumb.</end_of_turn>
And now you will make an incision of the adhesion to the soft tissue, which must not be made too acute, having previously made a small incision to prevent the patient from being troubled by the operation, and leave the soft tissue which you do not need.
And let your incision be such that it will excise the adhesion without causing the palpebra to be forced out of its natural position, and that the adhesion is completely healed.</end_of_turn>
And put your hand into the eye with salt water; or distill over it vinegar dissolved in water.</end_turn>
Then separate between the palpebra and the eye with gauze of lead, and place over the eye a soaked pad of cottonwool, and use three days later supporting remedies until it is healed.</end_turn>

Of incision of the nail and of the prominence of the caruncles of the lacrimals.</start_turn
You know that the nail exists in two ways, that is, when it is nervous, resembling a hard, white substance; or when it is non-nervous, resembling solidified moisture, which when you touch it, or force it to take off with the thumb, it is torn and the nail is not held in place.</start_turn
And both kinds do not begin until the larger lacrimal reaches the tip of the eye, covering the vision and preventing the light from entering and the movement of the eye.</start_turn
Greater is the skill in the work of the incision of these than that the patient should keep his head down on his belly, and you should grasp the hair of his eyelashes, elevate the eyelid with your hand, and collect the nail with a small clamp and stretch it outwards.</start_turn And now you will take a needle and enter into that a hair of horse or of ox or of calf, or something like that, or thread, or a strong thread, or gradually double the extremity of the needle and keep that in the middle of the nail, and pierce that with the needle, and tie with thread the nail; and stretch that outwards, and scrape with the nail the side of the pupil which touches it.</start_turn And so you will leave that behind the nail at the back.</start_turn
And leave your incision at the root of the lacrimal with soft tissue or small forceps, and remove the natural caruncle of the lacrimal so that after the incision there is no continuous flow of tears.</start_turn
And as for the nail, you will keep it for some time on the nail extended or with thread, as we have said, and let it be protruded with soft tissue like this:
Be careful that in the soft tissue you do not touch the corneal membrane and that you avoid breaking it, and that the pupil is not perforated.</start_turn
And finally you will apply a little salt or plaster to the eye, and do that for a few days; and take care of that which covers within that it is healed.</start_turn
And if the nail is not nervous and you cannot insert the needle, or if it is not held in that nail, know that this kind of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed in the same way as recommended in the division.</start_turn
And if you want to make an incision of that, then you must hold the patient's eye and take soft tissue like this from the edge of the wound with great acuity according to this method:</start_turn (End of text)</start_of_turn> And sometimes when that is rare and is confused and comes to that place, then distill from your remedy in the eye of the patient with a little plaster or with vinegar or with salt, and instill the eye into the other day.</start_turn
And repeat this operation until all that is of it is removed, except that the contrary after the cautery is in the eye, because you will have seen that, and care for the beginning of the after-pain until it is healed.</start_turn
And repeat your operation about that reason until it is healed.</start_turn
The prominence of the lacrimal caruncle, if you notice it in the eye for a long time, suspend it with a clamp; and make an incision of that part, and do not finish the incision so that it does not cause tears to flow.</start_turn
And immediately distill in the tearful eye and make it secrete until it becomes healthy.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
From the beginning of the ailment and from what is born of marrow adjusted in the swellings.
Some veins in the heel of the foot are born of yellow marrow, and are over-dilated until they cover the pupil, or approach or stretch over the eyelashes and strongly compress the eyelashes against the margins of the orbit and are gathered together like a bundle of brushwood
More important than the operation is that the patient suspends his seat in the belly; and immediately after open the heel of that foot and collect all that marrow until convenient, and take it with a forceps or basket; and immediately break the marrow from its beginning until everything is finished with the forceps, and keep your hand over the area to prevent you from damaging that which you have just operated on
And be your incision with which you break those or with spatula which we have recommended at the beginning of the nail, or with small forceps with which it is collected securely according as the form of them will come later in this chapter.
Therefore when the incision is completed and all that marrow has been collected, immediately fill the wound with coarse salt, or distill it into powder and remain like the corrosive medicines, and keep your hand over the area covered with a piece of cloth until it is certain that the wound has healed
And if there remains any cause of the ailment and the master wishes to make a cautery, and fears a bad healing, then read the wound and care for that bad healing with water until it subsides, and immediately repeat over that which has been operated on until it is healthy, and in the marrow which is adjusted in the wound of this kind.
Moreover you must know that all the care of the wound is natural or accidental, or with iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that that limb is suffering from that operation

On the collection of marrow in the wound.
The yellow marrow which is seen in the wound hinders the operation and must be evacuated from the wound for several days.
Therefore it is necessary at the beginning to consider whether the marrow in which the yellow marrow is strong and in which there is no other disease that is yellow, then collect that marrow.
And command the patient to suspend his seat in the belly, and immediately suspend those veins with a sponge or two according to your prudence; and let that sponge be doubled in this way:
or so two sponges gradually in a body according to this form
And immediately gather those veins with fine forceps, with dexterity, and withdraw them hour by hour, until all those veins are evacuated from the wound and become relaxed
And keep in mind that you do not damage the edges of the wound; and if in the morning during the operation you see the sun, and if you are firm in your operation that you do not break except those veins.
And when you have finished, immediately distill in the tearful eye green or yellow to that the corrosive quality destroys what is remaining of the marrow.
Moreover if that is not possible for you collect all at that time, and immediately cover all with water that comes out of the wound, and read it for five days until the pain is gone and that the cautery is certain
And repeat over it according to the physician's management until it is healthy.
And this is the form of the forceps

On the reduction of swelling to the head
When you cure swelling with cautery or acute medicine when it is not healthy according to the narration, do not be afraid of it but make incisions over the maturity of the swelling, and extract all the moisture that is in it until the bone is discovered
And when the bone is discovered and sometimes in its corruption or blackness, the following method is used:
The pain is fierce, not like that of a wound, and the head is round thus as if it were pierced with a needle.
Stay over the diseased part of the bone, and when you have rotated that between the thighs, press your hand gently until you know that the swelling has subsided.</end_of_turn>
And when there is any swelling, restore the limb naturally by stretching outwards and upwards.
Therefore, if the limb is consolidated and there is no new swelling, and the pain has disappeared from the belly and the area is relaxed and quiet for forty days, and it has not reappeared and has not become chronic, then you know that the patient is healed.</start_of_turn>
And if there is still pain, do not hesitate but reduce the fracture to its natural shape, following this method: if you discover the bone, take three stripes according to this method.</start_of_turn
Whether the limb is triangular in shape, or the bone is protruded forward towards the limb as often happens.</start_of_turn
And stay over the bone, and take hold of the lacrimal bone; lengthen your hand a little, and rotate your hand over the stripes until you have penetrated all the bone, and you will know when the pain has gone when you can move your hand freely.</start_of_turn
Therefore, restore the limb naturally with topical medications and stretching outwards as before.</start_of_turn>
Therefore, when the bone and limb are hardened, the matter which exudes from the parts returns to its place, so that this is more curious concerning the pain.</start_of_turn

Of the reduction of the prominence of the bone.</start_of_turn
When the bone is prominent in its entirety and does not subside or diminish, then you must let the pain pass, and after that, follow what is said, and give rest to the neck by restraining it, and give them good nourishment; and put on the bone a plaster containing alum, aloe, rue and saffron, and strengthen the bandage over the bone with powder.</start_of_turn
And the method of the powder is that you take lion's mane cloth four times folded; make use of these layers.</start_of_turn
And stay over those in layers according to the amount of which the bone is in need.</start_of_turn And strengthen over those with a firm and strict bandage; give repeated compresses with friction on the scar; and prevent the wind and keep the bone straight day and night.</start_of_turn
Even if the ligament is softened, you must keep it straight.</start_of_turn
And prevent the ligament both day and night as we have said.</start_of_turn
And if sometimes the bone has already been reduced, well and good; otherwise, keep strengthening the bandage with the powder and the stricture and the compresses until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Of the incision of the prominence of the covering membrane of the bone.</start_of_turn
When there is disruption in the covering membrane of the bone, and it is prominent and proceeds outside the eyelashes like a piece of barley, and its shape is that of a man, as it is often, then when you wish to pierce it, do the operation as we have recommended: enter the needle at the root of the membrane of the lower part towards the upper part, and put the needle in such a way that it is doubled over at the lacrimal; make it penetrate and extract the first needle according to its situation; and then pierce the area of the doubled thread and take hold of the membrane with the part of the needle, and strengthen that hold.</start_of_turn
And extract the needle and stay over the bone covered in infused albumin until the thread comes out of the bone.</start_of_turn
And take care of the bone so that it is comfortable until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn
And many times the whole part around the bone with a circular mark is gathered close to the bone, and it is perforated with a needle with a fine point that comes out from the head of the bone, and the albumin moisture runs out, and the bone goes down and enters deeply.</start_of_turn
And strengthen until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Treatment for gout.
This disease which is called gout is nothing other than inflammation which is adjusted in the limb like water descending and not the other way around.
Therefore the operator must make the disease appear on the affected part, and having taken hold of two fingers of the hand, must see if the inflammation persists in the lower parts, and if it does not vanish, must dry it and not let it descend, and must hold the hand above the area in order to prevent its recurrence.
And if it does not descend there, you know that it is water.
Therefore if it is not prepared to descend as we have said, when the disease has been made to appear between the two fingers, and having taken hold of a sponge, apply it to the area surrounding the nail, between the conjunctiva and the cornea of the eye (where the blood vessels are located), so that the inflammation is expelled
When it has been expelled, then you should distillate lukewarm water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have boiled fennel and honey.
And so treat the other causes as well, until the patient is healed.</start_of_turn>
End of the text.
From the treatment of water descending from the limb
We have already said about the varieties of water in the section and what is necessary to perforate in order to declare it, when the time comes
Therefore make the disease appear between the two fingers over a scab and hold the limb firmly in place.</start_of_turn>
And place your left hand over the nail of the limb if the water is on the left; or your right hand if the water is on the right.</start_of_turn
And take a scoop with your right hand if the water is on the left; or with your left hand if the water is on the right.</start_of_turn
And hold the limb of the scoop under the nail near the edge of the nail of the tear duct, and press the scoop with your hand in such a way as to push the water out.</start_of_turn
And pierce the limb of the scoop and sit down, because the scoop has already reached its purpose due to its weight.</start_of_turn
Therefore take the measure of the heel of the scoop to the pupil, which is the distance from the center of the pupil to the edge of the black part of the eye, which is the cornea.</start_of_turn
And so remove the water from the limb and apply another sponge to the area underneath, so that if the water descends too much, the disease which was on the limb will vanish from the area which the eye can see, and the water will remain in the limb.</start_of_turn
And so rest for a while; therefore if the water has descended, remove the other sponge without delay so that the scoop is not burned.</start_of_turn
Therefore when it is dry and does not descend, take out the scoop easily, and wash your hand frequently; and dissolve in the water a little clear salt of gemma or in oil with poppy seed and vinegar and water.
And so avoid those which are not from our time and rest over those which are treated with poppy seed in vinegar.</start_of_turn
If you do not obey your scoop when treating the limb due to its hardness — for some men whose limb is hard in this way — then you must take the sponge which is called alberid of which this is the shape:
And thus pierce through that conjuncture, do not touch your hand to the wound, and do not do so until the scoop has reached the limb spontaneously.</start_of_turn>
And so remove the scoop according to what has been said.</start_of_turn
You must praise your work, whether prepared for the sleeping patient or when the disease descends spontaneously in the limb in which the patient sleeps in a dark room, and you must prohibit all movement.</start_of_turn
And rest in the nature of the water so that its nature is calm, and do not move the limb in any direction, neither right nor left.</start_of_turn
And let the dressing be according to its disposition within the third day.
And remove the dressing from that moist wound and expel the excessive heat seen, and make some causes, and then return the dressing within seven days.
And do not cover it when performing the cure or at any time during the infusion There must be no covering so that the water may boil up willingly for a great and violent degree of heat
More if an abscess should happen, however, cover that it should be removed on the seventh day, and correct that which remains from the abscess that has come out.</start_of_turn>
Then you will wash their face and rest your hand over their mouth, for which reason you must regulate their diet for a few days, because they exist in great moisture.
And gradually remove the moisture from that moist area and speak of its causes.</start_of_turn>
And know that in no way is the disciple of vision exempt from seeing some herbs, and when you are in charge of the operation.</start_of_turn
And it has been reported to us of some of those whom the Lord has healed, and some say that fire is made in the holy water that is perforated with a needle from which the water is sucked up.</start_of_turn>
More, however, I have not seen anything like that in our land that has happened perfectly in our time, nor have I read of anything like that in the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.</start_of_turn
These are the forms of magical herbs so that it is about those whom he who ignores these things does not know:
And they are effective either from herbs or from iron itself, and their emissions are like this strange triangle, the acute extremity like this one, and the blunt one like this.</start_of_turn

Of the care of wounds nothing is in the nose.</start_of_turn
When there are various wounds in the nose, each of whose causes is like a scorpion's tail of blackheads, or like a polypo of feet; and this disease is called polypo because it is similar to that foot that is represented.</start_of_turn And it is a cancerous wound, spreading, of yellow color; and it is like a lion's wound not of yellow color.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when it is in these wounds of the lion, do not be fraudulent or cancerous, cover that the disease should be between your thighs and put it in the sun, and open the wounds, and prick it with your thumb on those wounds.</start_of_turn And remove that from the margin of the wound, and as you have comprehended from those things that have been said above when you know that all the wound has already been excised; for if any cause remains of which the abscess is possible, then at that time take that which is among the subtle instruments in order that there remain no causes.</start_of_turn More if the Lord wills with health or an abscess occurs, however, you must leave it covered until you cover; or if it is malignant abscesses, then you must cover and cauterize that until it is dissected healthy and all the cavities are evacuated.</start_of_turn
And put in the nose again oil or vinegar or wine.</start_of_turn More if the nose is opened and moisture proceeds to the palate within the tongue, then know that it is already healed.</start_of_turn
More if the moisture does not penetrate as it should because you cover it, then know that there is no wound in the pus surrounding the nails to which the abscess has not penetrated.</start_of_turn
Therefore know that you must enter firmly with faith in that to which any greatness pertains, do not touch it with your hands, and leave between each nut the amount of your thumb or less, and press the wound and insert a limb of the faith into the nails at the root or at another cause of which it is possible.</start_of_turn
And when that has been done, that is to say when the stench has vanished so that it reaches the canals of the nails, and when the stench has gone out over the greasy ointment, for these herbs that are given to children in schools have a similar action, and it is a light cause of that which you wish to do.</start_of_turn
And take out both limbs of the faith, one that goes out over the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and administer lukewarm ointment to the nails that are in the faith, and do so until you know that the nails are already in the faith.</start_of_turn
And now extract the tumor, and keep the nose close to the area where the sacred unguent is being applied, and do so for three days or until the inflammation has subsided from all the parts that are affected.
And at the end of the illness, keep the nose close to a plum catheter for four days until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
However much care you take, if the swelling persists, use this remedy.</end_of_turn>
This is the form of the instrument with which we capture vapor made with oils and medicines in the nose.</end_of_turn
Use silver or gold, which is like a little lamp with a wick, just like a wick on a candle.</end_of_turn
And if you like, make a closed tube like a tube, and insert the tube of the vaporizer into it, and make it flat, uncovered; to which you will attach the container which you will fill with oil or whatever you wish from the juices and substances you are treating.</end_of_turn

Great heat of vegetable nature does not lie upon the adjusted limb, which is why it is called an abscess, for you must suspend the belly or that you have the forceps and incisions, and do this with the reason, and read the pulse until it stops.
And if it is necessary to pause over the area, then apply either powdered rhubarb or other absorbent or expulsive powders.
And if the limb returns, then immediately cauterize it, so that it does not return again

Reason of toothache with iron.
When there are hard scales on the teeth and gums, and among the teeth there are sharp thorns that are black and cause corruption of the gum, and these are harmful to the teeth that are left.
Therefore you must open the patient between the thighs and suspend their head over the pelvis, and rasp the teeth in which these scales appear, because of which no other cause remains, and that causes blackness and yellowness and other things that are mitigated
Therefore if this is at the beginning of the illness, it is not necessary; but if so, repeat the remedy for the third day in a row until it disappears completely
And know that teeth often require various forms of movement and positions for their preparation in your operation And so that the cutter which is to remove the tooth is different from the cutter which is between the teeth in other forms, and these different forms of cutting must be prepared by you as you see them:

Extraction of teeth.
Therefore when you cure the tooth of its pain and carry out its total extirpation, there is no cause that can replace the heat of the tooth when it is extirpated, which is a sublimed substance except in the extirpation itself
Moreover when the illness is violent, you must certainly confirm that it is the painful tooth that must be extirpated, for many other humors deceive the pain of the disease, and that it is in a healthy tooth, and you must extirpate that and only when the painful tooth is eradicated, for we have already seen in the operations of barbers that this is necessary
Therefore you must be certified that this is the painful tooth, and if you know well, when you have stripped off the surrounding tissue of the tooth, remove the pulp from the root of the tooth throughout, and only then remove the bone that remains, or with fine forceps at the beginning little by little until it is completely softened
And immediately after that have great forces to hold firmly the large veins for good speech or stupor, and suspend the head of the patient between the painful teeth that you must not touch, and immediately grasp the tooth according to the rule so that you do not break it, nor does greater pain result from it
Therefore if it is not forgotten, take one of these instruments and place it outside the tooth from all sides to facilitate and expedite the extraction of the tooth as soon as possible
Moreover if the tooth is cracked or broken, you must close that hole and strengthen that area with a fine file at the end of the root of the tooth so that it is not fractured during the constriction of that area.
And you must work with great sacrifice around the entire circumference of the gum and keep your strength that you do not break it and remain whole, and return to the patient for the malice that is greater than the initial pain of the tooth.
And keep in mind that not all barbers do what is necessary in their fasting and daring in the extirpation of teeth, for they do not administer what we have recommended; for many humors cause greater evils than the diseases themselves, and the roots of these humors remain unremoved, or some of them, or that they extract the tooth along with some of the bone of the jaw, as many humors have testified.
And after the extirpation wash the mouth with wine vinegar or vinegar with salt.
And if blood flows out excessively, as often happens with humors, then immediately remove any amount of clot and sprinkle over the wound, and if you do not confirm that clot, cauterize.
The forceps and handles which are subtle in form, of long tongue and broad base, are useful at the commencement of working on the teeth.
They are thus also like large handles which, when they are new, are not bent, but are broad at the base.</end_of_turn>

The handles are useful both like a file or an abrasive.</end_of_turn
If you do not obey my advice concerning these forceps or handles, then you must lie down and expose the whole area, and then put in the instrument which has the name of atali, which is a small lever of this shape: ...</start_of_turn>

May the jaw bone or other bones of the mouth be fractured, or if they are loose, then let the pain be treated in that place where it is convenient for the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the teeth, and help me with the grasp of which this is the shape: ...</start_of_turn
And let it be of any great or small size, and let it be held tightly or loosely in the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is completely extracted; and then return the area to its normal position with convenient medicines.</start_of_turn

The foot is affected by a sharp and sudden pain, caused by cold humors which penetrate all parts of the body. Doctors usually call this gout. If it is necessary to make a mark on the surface of the foot, do so with a pointed cautery. Reduce the swelling by pressing inwards, and place your hand over the area to prevent the swelling from bursting. You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands. The following treatment consists of applying turmeric powder and egg yolks to the affected area, and using a decoction made from five needles, which will gradually soften the tooth, preventing it from becoming loose or causing further discomfort. And so be careful not to burn the flesh, and take away the cause of the pain.
And if the tooth has a fractured part and the tongue is swollen, then you must limit the movement of that part until the swelling of that fragment has subsided and is evened out, and until the tongue is no longer swollen or the word is not slurred

On the restoration of decayed teeth with gold or silver.
When teeth decay in front due to concussion and loosening by percussion or extraction, and the patient cannot tolerate what they eat, and you have treated them with anti-inflammatory medications, and it has not helped, then it is necessary to reinforce them with gold, for silver tarnishes and becomes weak over time.
And let the gold be placed in such a way that it can enter between the teeth; and the way to fill is that you take the gold and double its width between two healthy teeth, and that you make two incisions at the two angles of the gold between two decayed teeth, or if one or two, until the thread reaches the healthy tooth of the other side And repeat the process until you reach the part where you started, and strengthen your hand easily and skillfully until it is not painful.
And the thread with which you strengthen the gold must not escape from between the teeth
And remove the excess thread from the forceps or tweezers, and gather those that are in each place, and convert those and hide them between the healthy tooth and the decayed tooth, so that it does not cause injury to the tongue And so be careful like this until the remedy is complete
And even if it is slipped or broken, strengthen that or those with the other gold in this way at all times
And this is the way of the teeth and the figure of the restoration of two healthy teeth and two decayed teeth, as well as when these are linked:
And when a tooth or two have to be returned in some place, and they are decayed as we have recommended, and that they remain healthy
And do not do anything other than a good craftsman and a skilled person.
And many herbs are suitable for various causes of bone pain, and it is useful for them as a remedy for teeth, and is placed in the place where the tooth is damaged, and is strengthened as we have said, and remains firm and useful for a long time

On the incision of the ligament that is in the tongue and prevents speech
This ligament which is left behind by the tongue some herbs or is natural to it, or is accidental and caused by an injury that has already solidified
And the operation for it is that you burn the mouth of the patient, remove all existing saliva from the gut; elevate the tongue, and then incision that nerve ligament according to its width until the tongue is freed from its retraction.
And if there is any hardness or denudation, and that which has remained from the consolidation of the plague, then you must make a cut and divide that for its width until you have incised the ligament and the nodulation has been dissolved
And take care that there is no damage to the marrow of the bone and that you cut here and there so that blood flows freely.
And finally wash away the remnants of the incision with vinegar or wine or with cold water; and then leave the tongue free; so that the one who has the patient will not leave the tongue in any position at night so that it is not consolidated with another herb.
And if blood flows, stop over the bleeding wound; and if the blood boils, then cauterize the wound with a pointed cautery as much as it agrees with the matter. And if it is necessary to treat the other causes besides this, then do so when they are healed.

And when you see that according to the manner which I have said concerning her whiteness and length, that she has the disease and that she will bite her tongue, which is an instrument from which she takes her form, and she will keep her tongue on her gums, and will throw that out and insert it with one of two instruments which are said in the beginning of two thighs.</end_of_turn
And you must not insert it except when it is adjusted according to the natural terms of her habit, for if you insert it more, you will make her suffer.</end_of_turn
And concerning the beginning, use of that which we have recommended in the beginning of two thighs, and care for that until she is healed.</end_of_turn
More if the disease had been frightened by the beginning of the illness, cover that you use an instrument in the cautery of it, for the manner of the cautery is nothing but acute water, and that you keep the head of the patient over the illness, and immediately take hold of her tongue with that instrument which we have mentioned, and immediately drink from the water which we have mentioned in the chapter of cautery, and comfort her with that cause that is alive, and stop that from spreading or subsiding, and fill the hollow of the instrument of which this is the form:
So that the extremity of the cavity in which the medicine is placed is just like the cavity of a bowl of ray, and stop the instrument with the medicine on the vulva, for the disease will bite over the teeth so that she will swallow saliva or mucus from the mouth of that one for the intrinsic medicine, so that no other cause comes from that concerning the belly of her and that she recover from that.</end_of_turn
And you do the same with your hand on the medicine, and press that onto the uvula for a space of a quarter of an hour until it is darkened and relaxed by the bite of the medicine.</end_of_turn
And if you will, take a sponge and wrap that around the extremity of the ray, and immerse the sponge in the medicine, and put the ray on the sponge in a tube so that the sponge adheres to that tube, and do that for as long as you wish until you have achieved what you desire from the cautery of the toe, and then remove that so that it dries and falls off by itself within three or four days.</end_of_turn
And if you do not agree that you will repeat the medicine, repeat that, and immediately after the cautery remove the cautery from the circuit of the toe with the sponge in the border, and modify that which is in the circuit of the medicine, and let her drink from fresh water, and let her be treated with embrocation, and be protected from drafts until she is healed.</end_of_turn
And this kind of treatment is more safe than the beginning and more long of fear.</end_of_turn>
Some women are cured of the swelling of the heel with water that is more subtle than cautery and beginning, which is cured with fumigation in this manner: take cinnamon, rue, origan, balm, Arabic herbs, chamomile, broth and similar to those herbs, and mix all those things together, or some of them, in a bowl, and pour them onto vinegar, and let them boil; and the vinegar should be drunk lukewarm, and be in the middle of the bowl a piece of sponge, about which is placed an instrument of copper according to this manner; be it made of silver or copper.</end_of_turn
And let the extremity be introduced into the mouth of the patient until the vapor brings the swelling of the heel over the sponge, until the swelling is softened.</end_of_turn
E aprop itera over those veins which are swollen until they are dry, and keep yourself that you do not perform this cure at the beginning of an attack of gout, for it will be too tight in the attack, and do not think you can perform it, but you must declare the attack of gout to them beforehand.</li>
May be this instrument is not at hand, however take a tube and bring close to the patient's mouth a cloth of wool, so that the mouth of the patient is covered, for the closure of the wool prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.</li
And this treatment is good for health.</li

Of extraction of splinters and of that which adheres in the socket and of the other causes.</li
Swollen veins adhere in the heel or the bone of the foot or any other cause.</li
Then cover that you extract that which is visible, about which you cast the glance, for you promise the tongue with the instrument, so that you tell them beforehand that it is in the socket.</li
And that which is not seen and is hidden in the socket, cover that you make the patient vomit the pain before the food is digested in the stomach, for it strengthens the underlying cause if it is not evacuated by vomiting; or that you swallow the pain a spoonful of mustard or radish or a spoonful of bread dry; or give a spoonful of sponge marine soaked in oil, and bind it firmly with faith, and quickly give it to them, for when the pain is expelled from the place where the spines are and is extracted, the pain is forgotten.</li And take an eel and hold it firmly bound, and be seated at a table and order that it be extracted; or take a bowl and order that the thing be put in it and order that it be withdrawn.</li
And if the causes which we have mentioned have not been expelled, the hour has come to use a lead instrument in this way:
And be larger than an eye of a needle, and in the cavity of the limb be a concavity which you will enter into the socket easily.</li
And the patient should keep their head raised, and keep yourself that you do not touch the patient’s throat with your hand, for so you will cause them pain in the throat or the bone or that the physician puts their hand there.</li
However, since the patient has already introduced the thing which is causing the pain, for their knowledge of the location of the underlying cause and for pulling it out themselves, they throw their hand at the instrument in their hand, as much as they are prepared for it until it is expelled.</li
End of Document.</li
Of the extraction of a blood clot attached to the socket.</li
When blood clots are medicated with medicines and not confirmed, consider the hour in the socket of the patient to the sunlight, because you have compressed the patient’s tongue with the instrument which you have recommended.</li
Therefore if sometimes the blood clot comes out, extract that which is once small or which is gently grasped downwards adequately.</li
And if it is not possible for you to extract that, take a curved needle and insert it into the socket of the patient, and keep in the cavity of the needle a burning iron, and do as many times (until the blood clot is dead and is separated from the socket) and abstain from giving them anything to drink for the whole day.</li
And give them a jug of fresh water, and open the patient’s mouth with that, and wash the mouth with that; and do not swallow anything from that cause and make the water flow for an hour nearby their hand, for the blood clot will be as cold as the water that flows.</li
However if it has not been expelled from that which we have recommended, the hour suffocate the patient with their thumb or with their index finger for the instrument which we have recommended in the fumigation of the uvula.</li
Do thus, so that it falls.</li
And another way of operating in the fumigation of that is that you take a bowl in which are burning coals and cover the bowl with a cover of which there is a hole, and put the extremity of the instrument in that hole; and immediately take away the fumigation; and place the patient’s mouth over the extremity of the needle, and close their mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the blood clot, for the blood clot will fall down.</li<end_turn>
If he does not vomit, then repeat the fumigation, and abstain from food, eat only salted herbs and the like, and do not drink water. In this way it is necessary that this treatment be discontinued.
This is the way of the instrument by which the blood of the gout patient is extracted from the groin; and it is similar to forceps in this way, though sometimes it has a curved handle: which is placed against the groin, and its extremity is like the beak of a heron, which is strong, in which the lime is grasped, so that when pressure is applied to any cause, that does not yield
Chapter 40.</start_of_turn>
In which is the sum of the words in the recognition of apostemas and in the section of their causes.</start_of_turn>
Apostemas are various kinds, of various temperaments, as each recollection reminds us, from some in this book.</start_of_turn
And they are various in perforation and section of them by two methods, one for the kind of apostemas in themselves; and for what causes them.</start_of_turn
The second method is for the places in which the disease occurs, for the apostem that occurs in the head is different from the apostem that occurs in the heel; and the apostem in the fleshy part is different from the apostem that occurs in the joint; and each one of them must be treated separately.</start_of_turn
And there are some apostemas that must not be perforated but must be treated with the maturation of the disease in those or alongside them.</start_of_turn
So other apostemas must be cauterized when they are crossed, and they are not matured according to their cause, as well as apostemas that are close to the joints, for an apostem that is close to a joint, the sooner it is treated the better, because if it is delayed, it corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint, because it is a cause of stiffness of that limb; or it is an apostem that is close to the great toe, and if you delay the perforation of it until it is mature, it does no good to the great toe; or it is close to the heel, so perforate it only when it is not mature; and do not perforate it cruelly, but only when strictly necessary, for fear of injuring the heel and making it elongated towards the heel, and causing fistula, or that it is too late in the course of the disease.</start_of_turn It is better that you know the time of perforation of the apostem, and that is when it is mature.</start_of_turn
And you must know that it is mature when the pain subsides and the fever ceases, and also the diminishing of the swelling and the pulse, and the increase in the height of the apostem, and the other signs.</start_of_turn
And you must know that the perforation must be done beyond the area of the apostem and beyond the area of the inflammation.</start_of_turn
And the perforation must be done throughout the limb or the body, if the apostemas are in the parts of the face or of the feet, and in the place of the lacerations, of the nerves, of the arteries; and finally, in all the places where there is no reflection; for in those where there is reflection, use the perforation according to that limb.</start_of_turn
When the apostem is in the fleshy part, it is better that you delay the perforation of it until the digestion of it is confirmed according to the custom; as we have said; for if you perforate it before that, you prolong the course of the disease and of the pain, and you make the edges of the wound hardened and the depth of it.</start_of_turn
Some apostemas must be perforated according to the breadth of the limb or the body as necessary, or according to what the limb itself indicates.</start_of_turn
And you must administer little perforation, and in large apostemas great perforation and wide or many small sections according to the diversity of the size of the apostemas.</start_of_turn
And others are those apostemas in which the cord is concave and inflamed, when it is necessary for it to stay that way, as in the case of tumors and abscesses.</start_of_turn
And those are the ones that are inscribed with three angles; and those that are inscribed thus like the figure of a leaf of ivy, like the apostemas of the ankle bones.</start_of_turn
And in these there is round section and lunar section, and they resemble the latter.</start_of_turn
May he who cannot withstand these superficial wounds like after-effects of lion's claws cover that with such a perforation as to flatten it out as much as possible.
If the after-effect is large and has already collected much healthy tissue, perforate it immediately and do not be afraid to remove all the pus at that time; having extracted a part, then immediately insert another part back into its place, and extract another part again, and so make the boils gradually smaller until they are forgotten
Moreover, if the disease is of cold origin, or of woman in her monthly period, or a young child, or an old man in decrepitude, when the animal spirit is resolved by the evacuation of pus, and the disease has subsided, you must perform the operation then
Keep this chapter with great caution, and when you perforate for these abscesses, cover that you remove the carbuncles and consider whether the carbuncle of the abscess is slight or is a flat section; in the former case, administer to him those which are appropriate for small abscesses or carbuncles; but if the abscess is large and the wounds of the perforation are numerous, cover that you suspend the work until they have healed together
If in the abscess there is an exuding of some part of the tendon or if you have softened that in the circuit, cover that you bind it with old cloth or with thread made of gutta per the third day; and then process it in this way and care for it until the inflammation has gone away
Moreover, if there is a flux of pus in the hour of your operation, cover that you administer cold water and vinegar in which there is a gutta of lime, and suspend that over the area of the flux of pus until the boils have subsided
Moreover, if the flux of pus persists, cover that you administer regimen and care and powders which I have recommended in many places of this our book and of division.
Moreover, if it is in winter, and the place of the abscess is a place of many nerves, cover that you cover with powder in wine and oil caut, and place those over the places.
Moreover, if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy, cover that you sprinkle with powder with vinegar and oil or with wine and oil, and all that is cold until the third day, as we have said, and then cover that you remove the abscess and remove that, and administer in its care what is appropriate for it until it is healed.
And thus is what is necessary for the knowledge of the care of abscesses universally, more however according to the way of distinguishing which we have already said of every abscess in whatever manner it is to be treated individually
Chapter LXI.</start_of_turn>
Of the incision of abscesses which occur in the tendon of the head.
In the small tendon of the head, small abscesses occur, and of such a kind that contain tunics which are their substance; and the species of them are numerous.
And they are of a watery consistency, and those which contain humidity resembling slime And those which contain humidity resembling slime, and resembling sponges; and those which are solid
And in the incision of all, and in the extraction of these, there is no fear, as you must know the extension of these does not cause harm to the artery
The operation in the incision of these is that you express them with an instrument of the kind which you see here, which is called in Latin a sponge, until you see that it contains no more pus
For if what it contains is humidity, cover that you cut that by incision according to the length by superficial incision in this way:
And begin at the line of B and go to the line of G. When the humidity is evacuated, then you will scrape that for which there is that humidity, and do not leave from that any cause of that, for if there remains from that any cause, it will return again
And immediately submerge the area in Egyptian unguents, if present, or in water and salt; and fill that with that and leave that until the next day, for that will corrode all that remains of that membrane
And do that again over that area with Egyptian unguents repeatedly and persistently until you are confident that there is no longer any cause of that membrane; then care for the abscess with that unguent until it is healed
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, cover that you make the incision in this way I am sectioned without form of cross, and get nails between two lips of the section and run away from all parts, and strive your virtue in extracting the tunic which contains that.
Although it may be contrary to your surgery, know that I will tell you what happened first of all.</end_of_turn>
And thus it is said that in the soft swelling of the section and of caressing as you have heard; and the section over the soft swelling is lighter, which is less painful and has less moisture.</end_of_turn>
And many veins are like these swellings which are in the head among men who have no moisture in them; which causes that I do not understand about a swelling in the head of an old woman and I cover the swelling as if it were a deaf, ashen, white woman, which could not be drunk, and if anyone should attempt to pierce it, I would cover that.</end_of_turn
And in other swellings that happen in the head, another thing is not like this, as for example the swellings that happen in the heads of children and you must know the reasons for the blisters, however the section of these is superficial.</end_of_turn
And stop the perforation of those from the lower parts so that the body of the pain is relieved in the lower parts.</end_of_turn
And thus care for those with what agrees with the caregiving.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXXII.</end_of_turn>
Of the section of scrofulas which happen in the groin.</end_of_turn
These veins swell up these swellings in the groin and in the buttocks and in the armpits; and some veins swell up in the other parts of the body.</end_of_turn
And thus those that happen in the groin, and those that are generated between them, and all scrofula of those is due to the loosening of their own tunic, and thus as in the nodes and swelling of the head, as we have reported.</end_of_turn
And the species of these scrofulas are veins, which some are soft, and some contain moisture, and some are malignant which do not obey caregiving.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you sometimes have good disposition in the touch, when the color of that which manifests is proper to the color of cod liver, and is very dark throughout, and is not attached to the nerves of the groin, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not a swelling, cover that which you perceive as superficial of the part under the part beyond the body line of G to the line of B, and cut that from all parts, and extend two lips of the cod liver on nails, or on teeth if you need them, as we have said in the swellings of the head, and extract that little by little.</end_of_turn
And it is better to be cautious that the vein or nerve should not be pierced.</end_of_turn
And let the spatum not be too acute, that you do not put your hand on the incision, or that you frighten the patient, and that you do not do anything that is not necessary to do; for if you pierce the vein or artery you will prevent your operation, and when you pull away the soaked dressing or other cloths which remain flowing with blood, open the wound, and leave that until the pain of the swelling has passed and the wound has become softened and the wound has begun to be healed.</end_of_turn When the blood is drained.</end_of_turn
Therefore return to your operation until you have finished.</end_of_turn>
And thus inquire about the groin and say if there is any cause for the other small swellings, so pierce those and drain them.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the root of the large vein, cover that so that you do not pierce that scrofula from its root.</end_of_turn Having covered that as faithful and strong as possible and that you leave that until it falls by itself spontaneously.</end_of_turn
And thus fill the wound with old cloth which you have already soaked in Egyptian unguents, and care for that.</end_of_turn
And if you pierce that scrofula throughout, cover that so that you can adjust the two lips of the wound and keep them so tight that no excess remains.</end>
And if sometimes there is excess due to the greatness of the scrofula, cover that so that you understand to pierce the root of that, and remove that and administer sutures and what is said.</end_of_turn
The swelling that contains moisture perforates that superficial perforation here where it appears on your location of maturity, and pauses the perforation of that which lies below the belly button, as we have said.
And thus administer perforation, cool water on the hands and arms, so that it drives away that which is rotten from the corruption.</end_of_turn> And when the plague has already subsided, then care for the hand that has been burnt with the cautery until it has healed.</end_of_turn>
End of document.
From the incision of the heel of the apostema until the groin, the wound will be closed.
Say goodbye to the old woman at the heel, for in our land no one has ever seen her do this before.</end_of_turn>
And this is the inscription of the sermon of these people.</end_of_turn
May there be no scarcity of women in the houses, for the extraction of the heel is to be avoided, as it is of no use for the healing of all the veins and the greater part of the illness.</end_of_turn
May there be no scarcity of those who have apostemas who have cautzed at the mouth or groin or two nails, when the illness is not in the groin, to use the incision of the heel to escape from the danger which is useful for perforation.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you want to perform an incision, let three circles of the circles of the heel remain, or four at most for the width of the incision in those who are between two circles in quantity, that the incision be in fat, not in cartilage, and this place is suitable for the incision, for it is private of flesh and the vessels of sanctity are loosened.</end_of_turn
And if the doctor is cautious, let him extend the heel to the groin once, and then open the heel until it reaches the canal, but avoid the vessels of sanctity if you see any cause of this.</end_of_turn
And thus make the incision as we have recommended; and it is significant concerning the incision of the canal for the inflammation which is of that which comes out with the water that is of it.
And leave the wound open for some time.</end_of_turn
Therefore when the hour has passed in which perforation is feared, add two lips to the heel of the wound, and so that alone remains the cartilage.</end_of_turn>
And thus administer medicines that make the flesh disappear until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And say farewell Albucasis that the sum of the sermon which we have recommended, exposure is nothing but to see that some of these apostemas have already opinated the groin of the illness, and the illness is overcome within death, and the soul of it is between severed, and these go to wound the epiglottis so that the illness may breathe over the place of the wound for every breath, and be saved from death.</end_of_turn
And thus I command that the wound be left open until the malice of the illness is consumed; and the malice of it is for three days; and therefore I command that the wound be closed, and care for it until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And what I have seen for my part is that a servant took a basin and poured it into the groin and incised with that part of the canal of the lung, and I was called to care for it, and I covered the discharge like it comes from the dead, and I uncovered the wound and covered the soul that was sitting from the wound small.</end_of_turn
Therefore I confess that no vein or nerve has been injured, and that the soul has come out of the wound, and I cured it until it was healed.</end_of_turn
And I did not blame the servant if she did not recover her voice, and thus I say that she should return to the improvement of her abilities.</end_of_turn
And now I say that there is no fear in the incision of the heel.</end_of_turn
End of document.</end_of_turn>
From the incision over the apostemas that occur in the groin, and is called hernia of the groin.</end_of_turn
This apostema which is called hernia of the groin is a great apostema according to the color of the body, and is not found in women.</end_of_turn
And it is according to two manners, which is either natural or accidental.</end_of_turn
In nature it is not possible to cure [the patient].
And the cause is sometimes like knots of grass, and sometimes like a fistula, which is caused by the obstruction of an artery, and in this case there is fear. And do not presume with them like with iron, but only in the case that it is small. And you should know that you must investigate that which is said to you, and if you find it like knots of grass, and if it is not suspended by any vein, then you should prick that with the needle as if it were a knot, and extract that which is contained under the skin and the fat; and if not, then it is necessary to perform an incision throughout, and to take care of the area with what is necessary until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XLV.</start_of_turn>
Of the incision of the species of knots.</start_of_turn
Of the knots there are two species, and I have already said all the species of them in the division.</start_of_turn
And you must know that I recommend that you distinguish between a knot and an extrusion as if there were doubt.</start_of_turn
Therefore I say that an extrusion is characterized by heat, fever and severe pain until the inflammation of the excess has subsided; and it is completed by gangrene when the fever, the pain and the heat cease.</start_of_turn
But a knot is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and contains that thick liquid which is in the sac itself.</start_of_turn
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like cheese and is like this even when it is large or small, and they are of two species, one of which is like grass and contains moisture, and the color of the moisture is dark, as I have said in the division.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when you reach the treatment of a knot, you must extract that and inquire about the beginning of the discomfort which is called internal, according to how it appears in this chapter.</start_of_turn
And this is the way to inquire about fistulas and all knots, that you take hold of that discomfort and bring that to the most humid place that you find in the fistula, and you will remove the strings said to be in that little by little until you know that the discomfort has already penetrated the membrane.</start_of_turn
And finally put your hand according to the measure of the size of the fistula, and extract the gut and consider what remains of it.</start_of_turn
And if the current moisture, whatever its color, has been expelled, then you should prick it on the surface according to what I have said concerning other fistulas.</start_of_turn
And if there is no longer any moisture remaining of the gut, then you know that it is fat.</start_of_turn
And dry it over it like a cross in this manner: like this, and suspend that which is loose, and scrape the membrane thoroughly, and keep the skin or sac, if possible, over that and extract the pus from the knot.</start_of_turn
However, if it is broken during the operation, it is not possible to extract that pus, and many veins are seen inside, and you must extract it piece by piece until no cause remains.</start_of_turn
For if there remains any cause, little or much, the knot returns as before.</start_of_turn
And if sometimes there remains some small part, then complete the wound with several sharp corrosive powders and stretch the wound, and place your hand over that which is said to be the fistula, and care for the other wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the knot is large, then you must clamp the two lips of it and care for that which is under the skin.</start_of_turn
And if a pulsating vein is on the contrary side, or not pulsating, then you must clamp it and fill the area with wool that is rough and coarse so that it is old and rough for two days or three until the wound has healed and the swelling has subsided; and then you can return to prick what is remaining of the knot.</start_of_turn

Of these there are three species of gut, that is to say, some are large, and some are medium, and some are small.</start_of_turn

The small way to make an incision is as follows
Use knives, forceps, and falling extremities appropriately, so as to prevent damage to the surrounding tissues.

And so round, square, lion, assisi as large needles with which the threads are sewn, and are made of lead, or of gold, or of iron, or of silver, and the thousand are when they are made of lead.
And they are made by the experts of black plum, which they know that for these there are opened fistulas in the curvature of which are reflections, which are reflected by their height with those reflections

The medium form of the scapel
The small form of the scapel
The extremities of those with which the incision is made are acute and the others are not acute, and they are not stopped in such a way, but rather that it is useful in the excision of the nodes in order to avoid the risk of injury to veins or nerves, and for those that it is healthy for the disease and provides tranquility to a small degree in the performance of the excision of the abscess.
These are the forms of powders, and there are three spices: great, medium and small, like herbs.

If there is swelling of the joints from cold humors which have penetrated all parts of the body, and if pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
If the swelling is widespread in that way that it may burst, administer in it cautiously as we have said before.
Chapter 59.
On the section of abscesses which occur by incision or by vein.</start_of_turn>
When an incision is ruptured and the surrounding tissue is consolidated which is above that, then move the intestines away. It is known that inflammation and abscess are caused by an artery or vein: for when the abscess is caused by an incision, it is prolonged in the belly of the body; and that when it is caused by an embolism, sit on it where there is a stridor.</start_of_turn
And that which is caused by a vein is recognized from the symptoms of the body.</start_of_turn
And on this abscess there is an error, and especially in those which are left open, and in the armpits, and in the groin, and in many parts of the body; and it is not great, therefore cover that its care should be avoided, and that which is in the extremities, or at the head, that it should be avoided.</start_of_turn
More on that which is from the inflammation of the orifice of the incision, split the surrounding tissue section by section along the length; and immediately cover the section with a sponge and hold the incision, and drain the pus from the cavities until it is discharged.</start_of_turn
And immediately put over that needle and make that penetrate from one side to the other, and tighten the incision with a thread doubled in two places, — which causes you to see two arteries broken.
And immediately put in the place where there are two ligaments at a distance, put a sponge between them until the wound is healed completely, and dissolve the abscess.</start_of_turn
And immediately administer care in which is engendered poverty until the ligaments are healed; and care that is convenient at any time until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the abscess is caused by the incision of a vein, then cover that you have your hand over the abscess along with the surrounding tissue, and immediately insert the needle leaving the surrounding tissue where you put your hand, and make that penetrate; and join together that which you have extracted from one side with that which remains on the other side, and close the abscess with a ligature as I have said above.</start_of_turn
More if you fear that you will extract the thread, then immediately insert the thread with that needle leaving all the abscess around the first needle, and strengthen the surrounding tissues in four places.</start_of_turn
And immediately dry the abscess in the middle of the wound where it is, when it is finished there, then immediately close the surrounding tissue of the incision, and leave that which is left open.</start_of_turn
And immediately stop over the powder which you have soaked in wine and oil, and immediately administer the care which is useful with cold compresses and ointment until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Chapter L of the abscess which occurs by the twisting of nerves.</start_of_turn
In the same way as it occurs with an incision and a vein, and similarly it occurs with an abscess in nerves when it occurs by their percussion or by excessive work, and for a similar reason.</start_of_turn
And it is more useful in the places of the attendants or the thigh, or in any place in which there is much movement of the joints.</start_of_turn
And the abscess is difficult, and is like the color of the other body, and is in those of greatest susceptibility to it when it is stretched violently, sitting in the patient like a stupor.</start_of_turn
It is not an abscess prolonged in the belly of the body, and for so leave the surrounding tissue, and do not touch anything from the surrounding parts neither forward nor backward.</start_of_turn
Therefore in those which are in the joints do not cover that it be encased with iron, for it will strengthen the pain.</start_of_turn
More in the head or in the front of the neck tighten the surrounding tissue.</start_of_turn If it is only a slight swelling, then it is enough to force and cut away that which is the cause.
If it is great, then you must suspend it once, and excoriate it, and then remove it; and suture the wound, and care for the inside until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
End of conversation.</end_of_turn>
From the incision of the abscess which happens from the heel that happens in the belly.</end_of_turn
We see in the belly of these people veins that are like those of the fungi, because their root is subtle and their head is large; and their lips are withered, and it is because of these that it is little and not magnificent.</end_of_turn
I have already seen one in whose belly were two people who resembled fungi in size, and there was no difference between those white ones, with little root.</end_of_turn
And their lips were toward each other, and they were swollen, and moisture ran from it all the time.</end_of_turn
Therefore I pierced them and bathed in vinegar up to the ankle.</end_of_turn and the other up to the knee.</end_of_turn
And the operation in the incision of them is that you consider if the illness is humid, and if the color of the liquid is white, humid, with subtle root; then you must make an incision with a spatula of lead, and while you are present there cauterize with fire so that the veins that are seen during the incision are expelled without damage; and if you see that it is healed, cauterize it.</end_of_turn
And if sometimes the illness is slight and fearful, guard yourself from incision with fire; more than that, trust in a recent wound, and strengthen that liquid, whose manner is that which we have mentioned; and read for two days.</end_of_turn
And adjust in the stricture of the thread of lead; therefore, do not cease strengthening the lead greatly until it is abscised and falls off by itself.</end_of_turn
If there is great root, indeed, in the incision of these there is some cause of fear and dread, especially in those in the belly.</end_of_turn
It is possible that you must dissect a large part of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.</end_of_turn>
And care for the inside until the wound is healed.</end_of_turn
And keep in mind that you do not presume to incides those that are of fatty color, of little sensation, of regular gait, for those are abscesses.</end_of_turn
And I recall that lately I saw a similar case.</end_of_turn
End of conversation.</end_of_turn
About the care of great eminence of the navel.</end_of_turn
Great eminence of the navel is caused by many things; or for tears of the sac that is over the belly, and these are covered with cloth or gut as in other ruptures; or for healing which flows from veins or intestines as is said, or for excessive wind in the belly.</end_of_turn
If it is for a tear of the sac and for covering the cloth, indeed, the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body; and it is like this that it causes pain, and appears in various situations.</end_of_turn If it is for the return of the gut, indeed, the situation of that which we have mentioned in those which we have recounted is of many different kinds, and as you have said concerning those which we have said are hidden, and you must return it; and it is very strong in it so that it is not weakened by the bath or violent work.</end_of_turn
If it is for humidity, indeed, it is like this and is not hidden when you put your hand on it, nor is it constricted, nor is it painful.</end_of_turn
If it is for healing, indeed, at this time the abscess appears darker and declining.</end_of_turn
If it is for nothing, indeed, the abscess is hard, large and tough, and is fixed according to a quantity.</end_of_turn
If it is for wind, indeed, the touch of it is like this.</end_of_turn
And the operation in it is that you consider if the great eminence of the navel is for the healing of the intestines or veins or for wind; you must prohibit the care of it, because in that case there is fear and dread just as I have said concerning the abscesses for intestines and veins.</end_of_turn
If the chief of the belly is for the belly or the skin, then command the patient to sit upright and extend; and approach and grasp the circumference of the belly, and command him to place his hands between your thighs; and surround the belly with a sponge lap in the area which you have marked with your finger; and extend the greater trochanter to the lower parts of the thigh with one great; and bind firmly or loosely with a bandage and in a decent manner.
And approach the heel of the greater trochanter and extend it over the ligament and insert the thumb into that place and pull the belly; and if you have found it neither grasped nor protected for the ligament, then you extract the stone and push the belly down to the lower parts of the belly.
And if you have found the skin, then take hold of it with one hand; and incisions the excess of it.</start_turn>
May be it is contrary to your suture or vein, then surround that area, and return to your operation; take two needles and pierce through those two holes firmly and enter two needles into the circumference which you have made around the greater trochanter in the manner of a cross, which shall penetrate; and strengthen the greater trochanter in four parts over the needles.</start_turn>
Or if you wish, keep the needles in and let the extended flesh rest until it falls down by itself; or incision that when it is slight and falls down, and take care of that which covers the intestines until it is healed.</start_turn
And if the prominence of the navel is neither of flesh nor of moisture, then you must flatten the greater trochanter as we have said and extract the fat or moisture which you find in it, and take care of that which covers and consolidates the place.</start_turn

Instructions for treating fractures.
We have already said, in the division, about the kinds of fractures and how to treat them with medicine, and that it is dangerous to treat them with iron so that they are not ulcerated; and we have said fractures are engendered in the marrow and the care of their treatment.</start_turn
I say to you old men that certain fractures of the bone are in places where it is impossible to eradicate them, as for example those which are in the nipples or in the hip and to their neighboring parts of the limbs allocated to extract all that is possible, and more when it begins small.</start_turn
May be when it is old and is great, you should not attempt to treat it yourself, for I have never seen it healed by any man, neither have I heard of it, nor do I know that it has ever been healed by anything.</start_turn
And the operation for it is when it is allocated as we have said, that you precede the patient and loosen the bowels and evacuate black bile from several veins, and then sprinkle that on, if it is found, to replace what is manifested.</start_turn
And prepare the patient with preparation in which it is located for the operation, and promise on the cross that you will take care of them in the wound those which cover that; and cover all around with cotton wool so that no further cause of the cause of it remains.</start_turn Lay down the sacred oil, and do not touch that with fear, and press the places, and wipe away the blood, and take away the great blood with your hand or with the instrument which is at your disposal of instruments.</start_turn
May be it opposes the great oil of sanctity incision of a vein or of a suture, then cauterize that until the flow of the oil is stopped, and take care of that which remains of the treatment until it is healed.</start_turn
End of Document.
Instructions for treating dropsy.</start_turn
We have already recommended, in the division, the kinds of dropsy of the water, and their signs, and the treatment of them with medicine.</start_turn
And that which is cured with iron is nothing but the kind of ailment alone, and it is not approached with iron like the kind of tympanists or like the kind of ypospasm, for that is deadly.</start_turn
And when you have medicated this kind of dropsy of the tympanist with medicines and do not confirm your medicine, then consider, that if the patient has already achieved recovery, or is suffering from another ailment, besides this or that which is in the head or in the belly and resembling those, do not give him iron, for fear of that.</start_turn
May be sometimes the patient has an excess of bile, and there is no other ailment but only dropsy alone, and not a child nor an old man, then the manner of the operation for it is that you raise the patient between your thighs, and express his belly with your hand, fill the water to the part beyond the belly button, and take sponge sponges in this way:
The foot is affected by two sharp points extending from its extremity like a spathe; however, it must be remembered that the points must be made gradually, little by little, so that in the process they do not penetrate the intestine and cause damage.
And consider whether the generation of urine is from the intestines, because in this case you must remove the section from the navel to a distance of three fingers below the belly button.</end_of_turn>
However, if the generation of urine is due to disease of the kidney, then the section must be removed to the left of the navel at a distance of three fingers.</end_of_turn>
If the generation is from the spleen, then the section must be removed from the flanks.</end_of_turn
And do not let the section be over the rib where the patient is suffering, because it will cause the blood vessels to be torn there.</end_of_turn
Then pierce the entire cord with the instrument, and enter into that section, and hold your hand over the cord and the sac, and pull outwards; if there is the quantity of a nail or a grain.</end_of_turn
And pierce the sac until the cord reaches the point where the water goes, and that is the place of the urine.</end_of_turn And pull out the cord and insert an instrument of this shape: It is similar to a silver cannula; it is made of silver or ivory or lead, and has a small hole at the lower part and three holes on the sides: two on one side and one on the other; and the extremity is pointed according to the manner of a feather, as is sometimes the case.</end_of_turn
And at the extremity of the cord there should be an armlet, because when the instrument reaches the water, the armlet will push aside the instrument, thus evacuating a great quantity of urine at once; for if you evacuate less than this in an hour, the patient will die for lack of resolution of the spiritual animal, or because of the five fingers that are close to death.</end_of_turn
Evacuate in this way according to the quantity of the virtue of the patient and according to what you understand from the patient's virtue and the quality of their blood.</end_of_turn
And then remove the instrument and retain the urine which is the cause of the pain; for it is retained by the cord which retains the hole in the sac from which it escapes.  You are recommended to perforate in this way according to that manner.</end_of_turn
And repeat the operation another day if the patient tolerates it; evacuate a small quantity of urine each time, and do this for several days in fear, and take care that there is no remaining urine until it is all gone.</end_of_turn
However, if you fear about the patient, and if you see great quantities of urine, then cure him by burying him in cold sand, washing with bath, and exposing to the sun for a long time; and cure him with drying medicines until he is healed.</end_of_turn
And cauterize the stomach, the spleen and the kidney near the extraction of the urine, as I have related elsewhere.</end_of_turn

Concerning the care of children who are born with an unperforated bladder.</end_of_turn>
Some of the children are born with their belly button closed (or with a narrow opening or not in its proper place).
Therefore it is necessary to puncture them as soon as they are born without causing harm to the surrounding area according to this method:</end_of_turn
And immediately after the puncture insert a plum stone into the hole and seal it, and keep it closed for three days or for three quarters.</end_of_turn
When they want to urinate, they will urinate; and immediately after return it.</end_of_turn
And if you do not stop the stone, it is possible that the urine that goes over the area will not be able to pass through this hole.</end_of_turn
However, if the opening is narrow, it should be treated with a plum stone as we have said, for three days until it is enlarged.</end_of_turn
And those in whom the opening is not in its place, that is to say, in whom the cause is that the opening is at the tip of the bladder so that it cannot urinate downwards, until you elevate the bladder with your hand upwards; and it is not from the generation, for so the sperm cannot reach the woman according to custom, and it is a bad disease.</end>
The manner of the operation is that the patient be placed face downwards on the two sieves, and that you extend the head of the vein with your left hand with great extraction, and pierce the head of the vein at the ankle with a sharp needle, just as if it were being done with a pen, or that you leave out any part of it, so that the marrow comes out like the head of the vein and that the blood falls into the hollow place according to its due course.
Take care that in your surgery for the flow of blood, where blood may be shed, you stop it immediately when you have opened the vessel; and close the wound when the bleeding has ceased.
Chapter 65.
Of the swelling that occurs in the prepuce at the head of the vein and of corruption and blackness and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the vein
These swellings occur in the vein due to the abundance of bad blood
And of these two, one is malignant and the other is not malignant
Not malignant, because you should suspend it with a single sponge and evacuate it when it has gone; and then place your hand over that area to support it with Egyptian ointment; and do the same with the other, cure it with diaphtheritic ointment until it is healed
And if the swelling is malignant, of dark color, then you must administer cautery immediately at the site and in proportion to its size
May it be that if the swelling is in the prepuce of the ankle not circumcised, and part of the swelling is due to the swelling of the prepuce and the other part to something else, then you must keep the swelling that is due to the prepuce until it is consolidated; and when you have cured that which is outside, for when you have cured that the prepuce may be torn from the root.
And indeed these swellings occur in the genitals and in the prepuce of the ankle, blackness and corruption, where you must conquer all that is already blackened and which is about to become corrupted or which is already corrupted; and then apply a line over that area with oil that is composed of millet flour and poppy seeds and barley flour.
And do the same with the other treatment until it is healed
But if there is bleeding of blood, then administer lunar cautery in this way:
For the cautery needle is of two qualities, one for bleeding and the other for the wound when it is corrupted
And if the head of the vein is corrupted and is destroyed at the moment, then you must insert into the meat of the prepuce a catheter of lead so that the patient can urinate through that
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the vein (and this adhesion does not occur except in that of which the prepuce is soft, and over which circumcision is not indicated; and when it occurs in adhesion from corruption or from pus) you must scrape with a blunt sponge until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the vein is separated throughout).
And if it is difficult to remove them entirely, then you must scrape with a sponge over the head of the vein and the prepuce, and thus it is that the prepuce, when soft, is easily perforated by its softness
And then separate between the prepuce and the head of the vein with a strip of lint, which is already wrinkled in the cold water so that it does not adhere to another swelling
And do the same with an astringent compress until it is consolidated<end_turn>

Of the circumcision of children and the care of that which occurs in those who have been circumcised<end_turn>
Circumcision is not simply a continuation of life like other ailments; indeed, just as with our operation and our will, it is necessary that we assign in that better operation and way more lightness the loss of life.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their laws, for they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have learned through experience that the majority of physicians and barbers use to circumcise and to modify with new instruments and needles; and they use thread with a knot and pierce with a needle.
And I myself have proved all these methods and I do not find a better modification with instruments, thread with a knot that in modification with the needle, for these veins flee from the wound as soon as the cord of the prepuce is divided into two tunics, and the tension remains greater behind than before, and is easily forced to another puncture and pain is certain And it is a universal remedy for all ailments, and is digital, which is used by physicians, and is not based on the incision of the extremity of the viril member, for it is strong within the cavity of the limb.
More in the operation with nails, for strong pain is observed in fire and corrupts your operation.</end_of_turn> And the cord of the child is short by nature, and spotted veins are not seen in such a manner that it has not required medication, and I have seen that.</end_of_turn>
More of the medication that makes the forceps and ligaments firm and faithful, the more swelling, I experience discomfort, for the forceps are of proportional incision, for which reason the acute that is taken away is just as great as the acute that is left; and therefore as you please your hand so that they are provided in equal measure; and I incision according to a comparison in a time; and it is useful to compress the faithful with a figure containing the cord of the entire departure, so that there is no error in this.</end_of_turn
And the manner of the first operation is that you must make the child lie more if it is of those that I understand to be small, that you must not make them lie but rather that you must bind the faithful in their gut alone, and that you must examine them on the following day.</end_of_turn
And thus do that rejoice in this manner as much as you are able, so that you may receive your intelligence.</end_of_turn> And thus do that be between your hands more statuesque prepared, and do not be stupid; and hide the forceps in your hand or on the side of the foot, that the child does not see them or any other of the instruments.</end_of_turn
And thus do place your hand on the gut and blow in the cord, and pull that which is within until it comes out until the head of the gut, and then tighten that which is added to it of pus.</end_of_turn
The manner of the forceps in medication, this is the manner:
The one is wide-mouthed and the other is narrow-mouthed, that is not to say that it has a claw, and the length of the two acute is just as great as the length of two thumbs equally.</end_of_turn
More the error in medication is that it causes the intrinsic cord of the whole to flee, or part of it must be cut from the incision.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must extend that of your hour with your nail giving support to the apostemacy of the limb and that you must incision according to equality.</end_of_turn
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, the hour grasp that one alone and incision it.</end_of_turn
More if three days have passed, and remain what is flattened left the gut apostematized, the hour tell them that which has entered must be given up when the apostematized cat is expelled, and remove that with ease, and incision that as it is prepared for you.</end_of_turn
And take care of the head of the gut, for it will not be to it.</end_of_turn
And therefore take care of that which is in which the plaque consolidates of the powders which we have recommended in the treatise of the powders.</end_of_turn
And if it is incisions of the cord in measure, and obeys to the parts that are left out, that will not be noticed by them.</end_of_turn
More take care of that which we have said must be healed until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter LVIII.</end_of_turn>
Of the care of retained urine in the bladder.</end_of_turn>
Retention of urine in the bladder is useful for population for pain for peyne or for sand with gravel, or for poverty or for carbuncle, and it is similar to those that we have said of the methods of care in the division.</end_of_turn
And if it is not dissolved by water as we have said, the cause of the pain is that the stone remains. Therefore it is necessary to administer extraction of the stone using an instrument called a siringua. This is made of silver or lead, like a pen with a long tube, to which is attached a flexible tube about the length of a palm.</start_of_turn
As for the handling of the urine during extraction, take the bladder string and tie it at the base of the penis or scrotum for good support. Insert the catheter through the opening of the string into the bladder cavity through the urethra. Remove any foreign bodies from the opening of the string, and introduce the catheter with force into the neck of the bladder. Then enlarge the opening of the bladder with fingers and urine.</start_of_turn
And do the patient sit on the pelvis, embrace the bladder and the flanks with warm oil, olive oil and vinegar.</start_of_turn
Then withdraw the catheter easily until it reaches the level of the flank; then bend the flank downwards from the navel; then grasp the catheter with the thumb and index finger; and grasp the catheter with the other hand until it reaches the bladder. When the bladder is reached, the pain will be relieved, and this will not be in vain, but in the place where the stone is located.
And gradually pull out the string along with the urine so that the urine washes the wound.</start_of_turn>
Then extract the stone and do urine therapy. Use a catheter, do not stop until the bladder is emptied and the pain is relieved.</start_of_turn
The treatise ends here.</start_of_turn
What is the quality of the cleansing of the bladder with these clamps and instruments that are in agreement with water?</start_of_turn
When there is an ulcer or swelling in the bladder, or if there is a stone in it, or if it is contracted too tightly, and you wish to distill urine and medicines, it is necessary to use a clamp, which is as follows:
But if in the extraction of the liquid there is silence, then it is closed.</start_of_turn And there are three tracts: two from one side, thus as many times.</start_of_turn
At the beginning is liquid with sediment, in which is that which is stuck, and is according to the quantity that is in it. When any cause is removed from this, it is thrown out, and when it is expelled, it is thrown out with the water. And when it is expelled long, as the clamp keeps the naptha in the battles of the sea.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if you want to expel moisture from the bladder, insert the clamp at the moisture and extract from that liquid which is stuck in the parts below, because the moisture is expelled in the concavity of the clamp.</start_of_turn
And gradually insert the clamp into the flank according to what we have recommended in the catheter; and grasp the moisture with the water which grasps, because that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, and the pain ceases in this way.</start_of_turn
The provided text does not include information regarding the formation of the subtle crystals in the bladder, so I am unable to provide a translation for this sentence.</start_of_turn
And it is sufficient that it is made of silver or lead, of which the tip is similar to a small feather, and you leave the tube tied with a ligament.</start_of_turn
Then take the bladder and hold it still in that place where you want to crystallize the moisture, and tie that between two strong ligatures with a doubled thread, and heat that moisture over the fire.</start_of_turn
And gradually insert the clamp into the flank.</start_of_turn
And put your hand over the bladder with the moisture while stretching so that the pain ceases when that moisture has already reached the bladder.</start_of_turn
Or if your bladder is not present, take a spoonful of barley and make a circle; pierce that through with a needle; and insert a strong thread through those holes, even if they are torn; and add the circle so that it is added to the urine, because you stop the moisture that you want to expel from the bladder, with oil and vinegar.</start_of_turn
E aprop tu lia aquel en le instrument e fay am aquel ayssi cum has fayt am la vesica, e exprescio am la tua ma entro que la humiditat pervengua a la vesica.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery
We have already mentioned in the division the species of stones and their care with medicines, and the difference between stones engendered in the kidneys and those engendered in the bladder, and we will tell you of these things.
And we have mentioned the stone in which we must make an incision with my hand, and section
And the stone engendered in the bladder itself is that which is fixed in the bladder
And I tell you that this is a manifest exposure and abbreviation
Therefore I say that the stone that is mostly seen in children is the one that is found in the large bladder; and its signs are that the urine which is excreted from the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and appears in that sand; and the patient has frequent pain in his flank, and pale vomiting, and he is pale; and in this way he is dressed.
And it is strange the healing of children from this until they have reached the age of thirteen; and it is difficult to cure them in the old age Perhaps in the young it is better for this because it is between these things.
And concerning that from which the stone is greater and the treatment is easier; and if it is little, it is contrary to that
Therefore when we come to the treatment of this, cover at the beginning the one that modifies the patient's pain at the root which extracts all the pus that is in the wounds; for that wound a few streaks of blood hinders the poisoning of the stone from the inquiry of it
And also put pressure on the patient's pain in the knees and sit down and put a cushion under the thighs so that the stone descends to the belly of the bladder, or that it comes out through some blood vessel
And do that which is between your hands prepared, and the most of them will leave the cushions of their legs, so that the whole bladder is made to fall down to the lower parts
And do all this thing until it is finished
Therefore if you feel the stone in the space, then do as much as you can to cut around it with a section tool.
And if you do not succeed in doing all this, then leave it untouched; then cover with oil what you touch with your left hand, if the pain is in a child, or tell him half if it is an adult, and put that in the flank And wait for the stone until it is left untouched And convert that little by little to the bottom of the bladder
And do the same over that which you have touched, and expel that to the outside through the opening through which you made the section
Command the minister to hold the bladder with his hand; and command another minister to extend the thighs with his right hand and his left hand to support the crease which is left by the thighs, at the part of the place where the section is made
And thus will come out the stone without any bloodshed; this is the form of it. And split it in it where it is between the buttocks and the thighs, not in the middle part, towards the side of the left thigh; and the section should be made above that stone and the hand which you have mentioned should be held above the stone, and make a transverse section, for that the section outside should be wide and narrow according to the quantity of the stone which comes out of the bladder should be as possible, and not greater, than the force which compresses the hand which is in the buttocks concerning the stone because of the section, and is perforated because of its discharge.
And you must know that every stone has some angles and margins, for that its extraction is difficult for this reason
And concerning that which is like lion in appearance, and is round, and is made of its delight, its extraction is difficult.
Therefore if it is that one which has angles and margins, adjust it in the fissure
And if it is not so perforated, then cover with your hand over that; or strengthen over that with your thumb which is as if you were grasping the stone, and do not leave it; or that you put out of it the instrument which has a curved extremity
May it be that if you do not know what to do about it, then expand the tumor slightly, and if you see discharge of pus, cut off the root of that vitriol which is causing the trouble.
If the stone is larger, then at the beginning of the procedure you will push your hand to the mouth of the bladder, and then prick it there; and then push in a little bit; and do the same if there are more stones.
And if the stone is large, then it is prudent to know that this great section causes two evils to the patient: either that it remains there or that it sends continuous discharge of urine, because the urine is not completely solidified.
May you administer expulsion from within so that it is driven out, or engineer a fracture of it with forceps so that you can extract that which is in pieces.
Therefore when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe powder and dragon's blood, and strengthen that. And rest on that wound soaked in oil and vinegar, or in scented oil and fresh water, so that the burn does not remain fixed
And then keep the patient lying on the bed for three days, and do not remove the bandage until the third day
And when that has been removed, bathe the area with water and a little oil, and take care of that area for several days with diaphoretics and diuretics until it is healed
May it be that if in the wound there remains a burn, adhere and corrode, and from that it appears as if the urine is frozen in the bladder, and because of that the urine is prohibited (and that is known for the discharge of pus with the urine), therefore extract the said stone from the wound and extract that pus, because if it remains it will cause the bladder to become corrupted and putrefy
And then wash the wound with vinegar, water and salt, and against all spices, against all that may impede its healing until it is healed.
And cover in all the hours the care that you lie both thighs and adjust the medicines that are placed over the area
And if the stone is small and is in the marrow of the bone, and is fixed there, and the discharge of urine is prohibited, then it is necessary to cure that with an instrument which we call a needle, of which this is the form:
triangular section extended, acute, fixed in the flesh.
And then take hold of the thread, and tie that so that the bone does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the needle into the bone, perforating easily until the needle comes to that stone And you rotate the needle in your hand on that stone little by little, and you perforate the wound until you have pierced that of the other side to penetrate; because the urine will flow freely
And then put your hand over that which is left from the stone of the part of the bone that is fractured, which is fractured, and which is discharged with the urine, and the patient is healed.
May it be that if this cure is not pleasing to you for any cause that hinders you, then tie a thread to leave the stone, and another thread to draw out the stone. And then prick the stone in that marrow between two threads. And then extract that. And then remove the threads and bind the wound with ointment, which is useful in the wound
And it is not necessary to leave the thread to hold the stone, but rather to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other thread to draw out, because when the thread is withdrawn the stone comes out with it and closes the wound
And in this way it is necessary when you draw out the thread that you elevate the limb above the wound, or that it returns to the abdomen, and that you close the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
Of the extraction of a stone from the bones of the thigh
A stone in the thighs is rarely engendered.
And if you see a stone in any of these, then the cure of it is difficult, and is prohibited by experienced people
The one of them is that the strong woman is a virgin.
And the second is that you will not find a woman who is truly learned that will disclose any secret to the doctor when she is chaste, or who is among those women who have a husband.</end_of_turn>
The third is that you will not find a woman who is truly skilled in this art, especially the handling of the hand.</end_of_turn>
And the fourth is that the location of the incision on the foot in women is far from the location of the stone, because it indicates a difficult incision, and in that there is fear.</end_of_turn>
Maybe if necessary you must force her to drink, but cover that you take a virtuous woman, and few are found who are virtuous.</end_of_turn
Or if you are deprived of this, cover that you take a virtuous woman who is experienced in the art, or present a matron who is esteemed among women, or a woman who in this art has already known success.</end_of_turn
Therefore make that presentation, and command her to do everything that you order her, from the inquiry about the stone to the beginning; because it regards whether the woman is a virgin, cover that she puts everything she has said in her belly and wants the stone.</end_of_turn
Therefore if you find that, cover that you leave her what she has said, and command her to lie down on that side.</end_of_turn>
Or if she is not a virgin, command the matron to insert what has been said into the belly of the patient and over the stone, since she places her left hand on the bladder and compresses that well.</end_of_turn
Therefore if you find that, cover that you gradually move her from the orifice of the bladder to the parts below until you reach the reason for the complaint.</end_of_turn
And immediately insert over that the sensation of the matrix of the belly should be the reason for the cessation of the patient's complaint and that the stone be placed in that place, and that the saying of her is not left behind the stone together with her.</end_of_turn
And the incision should be small at the beginning; and immediately insert the instrument over that incision, and if you feel the stone, adjust the incision according to the quantity that you know the stone will be evacuated from that.</end_of_turn
And you know that the species of stones are various: that some are small and great, and long and round, and others are flat.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must know what species they are of that about which you speak.</end_of_turn>
And if you see flow of urine, adjust in the wet area treated and keep her there for an hour until the urine is gone, and then return to your operation until the stone is evacuated.</end_of_turn
And make that preparations are made for you from the instruments which are said to be used in the extraction of stones in women, so that you are helped by them in your operation.</end_of_turn
And if you see flow of urine, and you know that the evacuation of the urine is from the bladder that is uninjured, then you stop powdering over that place and open that which is dusty and strict, and do not proceed further; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for if you do the patient will die certainly.</end_of_turn And take care of the wound.</end_of_turn>
Therefore when the urgency of the urine has passed a few days, and the place has become soft, then you return to your operation until the stone is evacuated.</end_of_turn
Chapter lxii.</end_of_turn
Of incision for an abdominal hernia.</end_of_turn
An abdominal hernia is nothing other than an accumulation of moisture in the white sac which contains the intestines, and is called a sac of intestines.</end_of_turn
And many women are such in their own belly that nature has prepared in the part of the bladder which has already been said, and is not water but bile.</end_of_turn
The generation of this hernia is due to weakness that occurs to the intestines, because in them this matter is deposited, and sometimes occurs by a violent blow that is made on the intestines.</end_of_turn
And this moisture has various colors, because the color of it is sometimes changing to yellow or bloody, or orange, or black feculent, or white liquid, and that is the best.</end_of_turn
The water that causes this swelling is cold and damp, like the water that is found in the white parts of the testicles. When such water is in the joints, it makes them swell, and causes the joints to become painful and inflamed.
If the moisture is in the marrow itself, then the swelling is more round at the edges like a piece of wood, and because of this it is believed to be another kind of water.
If the moisture is between the hip bone and the white parts, then the swelling is in the middle of the limb.</start_of_turn>
And when you wish to recognize the color of the moisture, then you must see the color of the moisture in the swelling and note the form that precedes it; and according to what is seen in the remnants, judge what is contained in it.</start_of_turn>
Therefore when we come to the treatment of such a patient, we must command the patient to be flexible if possible, and sometimes to lie down.</start_of_turn
And let there be a slight elevation above the buttocks for any cause, and rest the limbs still.</start_of_turn>
And sit on the left side of the patient, and command the assistant to follow on the right side of the patient, who will extend his thumb from the hip bone to the part below the navel.</start_of_turn
And take a sponge and with a cutting instrument split the hip bone from the middle to the end of the bone marrow.</start_of_turn
And make the incision according to the rule at an equal distance from the line that should divide the skin of the hip bone, until it reaches the white substance encompassing it.</start_of_turn
And drain that, and observe, and keep me informed that you do not puncture that; and your drainage with which you drain for a part will be suspended with the greatest of care and will be written down along with the drainage according to the quantity that is possible.</start_of_turn
And then pierce the white marrow full of water with a wide hole, and drain out all the water.</start_of_turn
And then separate between two layers of the incision with nails, and stretch the bones outwards; and do not touch the hip bones encompassing the marrow, and suture the bones in that manner that is possible.</start_of_turn And suture that in its entirety or in pieces, and more importantly on the outer sides, because if you do not carefully observe the stitching of them, it is not safe that the water does not return.</start_of_turn
But if during the performance of your operation the water proceeds from that side of the bone, when you have completed the incision of the bone, return that which has escaped, and then adjust the two layers of the hip bone with sutures, and care for that as for the other wounds, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if you find the water corrupted by another disease, then cover that you lie the veins which are sore the nourishers, and drain the water, and care for that as we have said.</start_of_turn
But if the water is added in two equal parts it is because there are two hernias; therefore pierce that part as you have done with the other equally; and if you see that it is a surgical operation, then do it.</start_of_turn
And then dry the wound, and enter into the wound the soft lint submerged in oil or in scented oil; and after that cover another lint which you have submerged in wine and oil, and spread that over two hips and the belly; and cover that with doubled cloths and dust, and bind those over with thread in this manner:
and take two cloths and fold them with wadding as in this manner; and bind the limbs with which it is customary to bind ankles or wet lint, and bind them with a structure at the groin of the thighs, and one of the limbs preaches the hip bone inwards, and the other preaches to the part below the navel, and two limbs over two ankles and two limbs on two knees, and all the binding is adjusted at the groin of the thighs.</start_of_turn
And some physicians treat this hernia artificially with cautery in the place of incision with a knife; and it is that you take pointed cautery and insert it into that the hip bone, and ignite it as we have recommended until the white substance containing the water is discovered, and then you insert the cautery in this manner: and make a Greek cross.</start_of_turn>
And then pierce that with that marrow, and ignite until all the moisture is expelled.</start_of_turn
And then stretch out the thumb and index finger, and scorch them with the tip of the cautery; and prick with the pointed cautery according to what you can tolerate until it is bled dry; and keep your hand away from the fire that it does not burn you.
And you must know that this operation is more harmless and less laborious than the flow of blood, and better than an operation with incision
May it be that after the cautery in the time of incision or at the time of pricking, or the flow of blood, you cover that you care for whatever discomfort is caused to you by this, with care that you deem appropriate for it
May it be that if the patient is weak and does not expect a second operation on account of its horror, then perform the perforation as I recommend; and this is what you must do because we have already said what we mean, that that hernia is harmless.
You must know that you must place the patient over any high elevation, then perforate the cautery in the lower part of the limb at the widest point, and stop the perforation according to the length of the limb
And let the opening be wide enough that all the fluid comes out.
And then place your hand over the area around the joint and hold that one and leave that one, so that the fluid remains inside And then take care that the wound is healed
May it be that if there is discharge of fluid in that hour you perforate that: and that is not useful except for the fact that the white pus in the orifice of the wound causes discomfort and hinders the drainage of the fluid, you must know that you must take out the fluid from the boils with a pin or instrument of that kind; or apply to the wound a little plaster.
And you must know that the fluid will return, and is usually done in about six months or in the spring; and when it is done, the perforation must be repeated according to that manner, for the patient will suffer for several days.
The treatise ends here.
This section deals with the incision of a carbuncle and the care of the wound.
You must know that in the incision of this hernia there is a great risk of infection in the major parts; for I have seen the dismissal of them and their being saved for that better thing.
I remember the operation in this case and the qualities of the cauteries
Therefore, I say that the cauteries are born in the parts where their generators are composed and it is useful for many causes: or for sudden excessive humidity which is spread on the generators, or for percussion
The color of the cautery is according to the color of the limb, and it is not recognized by its pain, and is a hard cautery.
And the thick cautery is black, and it is not harmful to it
Some plants are useful for the swelling of arteries, and for inflammation of those as well as for the perception of them, or for the swelling of veins
But that which is for the swelling of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the cautery when you press that against those said tissues; and it does not touch that
But that which is useful for the swelling of the veins is not dispersed by any cause because of the compression against those said things
And it is possible that concerning this species it is useful to make an incision and on the others meats; and that you prick the root of the generators, and then extend the blood to the lower parts, and extract that from the white globules, and deliver the blood clot, and ligate the vessels, and prick more than you delivered that from all the parts of the blood
Therefore if the blood is already in those meats consolidated, you must extract the blood and prick that
And if there is adherence for any cause of the cautery, or between those that are between the vessels, you must deliver all that adherence and prick that for round incision
But if it is born from meat in the place of the adherence which is behind, you must prick all that is of it, and extract the blood as we have said
Therefore when your operation is finished, fill the wound with soft wool soaked in olive oil and wine; and take care of that as well as the other care that is to be done until it is healed.

Vital is a swelling enveloped by any covering similar to a bud, and it is difficult for the patient to exercise and walk on the affected limb.
And in the treatment of this disease is to fear what precedes it in memory
However, we must say that the operation must be performed at the first opportunity
I say that you should make the patient lie on a raised cushion; and that you suspend the testicles from the groin to the lower parts; and that you place the heel of the hand on the genitals with the thumbs against the ribs; and keep those other attendants that you have mentioned, and extend those with violent extension
Then make an incision on the outer edge of the heel for a transverse section through the vessels until the vessels are exposed
And then remove the entire part as we have said in the extraction of the intestines which are in the temples
And then leave in that place a needle which is doubled over, and tie one at the front of the place where the wound occurred, and tie the other at the back of them. And then make an incision in the middle of the limb for a transverse section according to the length of the limb, and remove whatever is added of the foul and corrupt humors
And then care for the wound like for other wounds in which you wish to make it so that the vessels which support two testicles do not break, which is not bad for what.
Maybe if the testicles were extracted or that the testicles because of the vessels were broken, it would be private of all nourishment for the wound, and that they would be established, or that they would be equal so that they are not harmful to those things.

Of the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The coming of this hernia is for section that proceeds from the abdomen extended over the belly of the greater curvature of the belly, because by this means the intestines of that rupture are brought close to some of the intestines.
And this rupture is either of the abdomen or of excess of it, and it occurs for various causes: either percussion, or cough, or cry, or elevation of any serious cause, or for any other reason.
And the sign of that, when it is for extension of the abdomen, is that it occurs little by little over a long time, and does not occur suddenly, and is swelling that enters within the belly for so that the abdomen compresses the intestines
And the sign of that is when it is for section of the abdomen, that at the beginning it causes violent pain suddenly; and it is swelling different from the apparent swelling outwards of the heel, and that is for the displacement of the intestine, and the body of the hernia to the parts beyond the abdomen
And many doctors forget about the gut sac in the belly, and call this intestinal hernia an external hernia
And some doctors are useful with wind, and some doctors run in the belly wound, and here it is retained, and it is in this way that it causes great discomfort of the patient, and some doctors make the pain worse and more when it is pressed
And in the treatment of these complications of this disease there is fear, for that we must avoid the danger in that place.
And the manner of performing the operation of that is that we command the patient to reduce the intestine with his hand to the parts behind the root of his curvature if he obeys the physician's order, and that we should cover it over the seat between the thighs, and elevate the legs of the patient.
And then we grasp the heel which is the heel of the testicles downwards, and we make an incision through the whole length; and we leave in two places at the ends of the incision two nails as we wish to open the incision with those.
And if it is possible for you according to the quantity that you are able to do that from that the hole should be forgotten
And then remove that membrane which is left behind the heel of the testicles, until the white tough membrane of any part is exposed
Then you will remove the intestine which is said to be between the testicles, which is between the white membrane and the abdomen, and that which is left behind the heel.
And immediately I grasp the wrist of the testicles towards the testicles, and I apply some white ointment to the left hand, and I elevate the heat towards the section; and I command the minister to extend the heat further and you will dissolve the adhesion that is behind the solution accomplished.
And I confirm that there is no cause for the swelling covered with the white ointment here Maybe if you find the cause of it here, then you will leave it inside the belly
And pierce at the back of the wrist of the testicles to make a section from which blood can flow freely and safely as we have recommended previously.<end_turn>
And administer soaked lint in oil, and keep it in the wound; and administer the bandage which we have recommended (and several layers of the white ointment are cauterized, which we have said above in connection with the fear of blood flow, that many layers of lint are burned away).
If the case is delayed, then cold water should be poured over it, and keep it covered until it has healed as we have said
And care for the wound with the other care of wounds until it is healed.

Of windbag hernia.</start_of_turn>
In this hernia nothing has been observed that requires special care for it.</start_of_turn
And first say that it is useful just as we have recommended in the hernia that is seen here; that is, you should bind the veins around the section over which the swelling facilitates them; and dry in the middle area around the swelling to prevent any swelling from forming there until the veins have fallen down.</start_of_turn>
And care for the wound as we have said until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Of the dislocation that is useful in the ankle.</start_of_turn
Some veins must be broken in the ankle as we have said before, and examine the area.</start_of_turn
And do not suspect any cause of swelling at the knee; and if you suspect anything, it is little; and return immediately.</start_of_turn
And if it is prolonged, adjust a fracture in the foot until the swelling subsides; and this is done by the stretching of the foot which is in the ankle as we have said, which causes the foot to be stretched, and therefore it is softened and the area is de-swelled and examined.</start_of_turn
And the treatment is with a pointed cautery as we have previously narrated.</start_of_turn
And many times it is treated with iron according to this manner: and the patient sits between your two hands, and you dry the area of the rupture of the swellings examined with a section from side to side according to the quantity of three fingers.</start_of_turn
And extend the white ointment that is under the wrist until it is revealed.</start_of_turn
And take the thumb and keep it over the prominent part of the foot, and press that against the belly.</start_of_turn
And bind the two prominent areas on the edge of the foot, and secure one to the other with a suture.</start_of_turn
And extract the limb of the foot, and do not cauterize the foot of all, nor extend the heat, nor any other cause as I will tell you in the treatment of intestinal hernia.</start_of_turn
And thus treat the inflammation as with the care of wounds, and when the inflammation subsides, restore the wound until it is consolidated; for its expansion is contracted and the elevation is not adjusted.
It is better to cauterize here in this place, for it is more likely to be safe.
Chapter 68
On the treatment of the swelling of the testicles
The testicles that are swollen with swelling are softened by means of oil, so that the parts between them are softened, and it is pleasing to them
When necessary is that which is requested in the treatment of them that makes the patient groan twice, and uncover the whole swelling that is softened over the natural swelling; and that you adjust two lips with the suture
And if you will, at the beginning of the softening of the swelling make three or four incisions with a firm suture
And thus treat between the sutures; and treat for the care of the other wounds until they are healed and the wounds disappear.
Chapter 69
On castration
Wise men say that castration is forbidden in our law, however I remember it in this book; and it is not necessary to recall it except for two cases, of which one is that the physician should know how to care for it when questioned about it, since he knows how to care for it when it happens; and the other case is that we must sometimes castrate other animals for our young people for those, thus as well as mares, and sows, and goats, and similar to animals.
And therefore I say that castration is useful in two ways: either by traction or by incision at section
When traction is useful, the way of performing the operation is that we make the beast lie in cold water until the testicles are softened and limp and hang down And then take hold of those with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear to touch them
When castration is useful for incision and section, hold the beast and grasp the testicles of the beast with your left hand
And then tie the surgeon, and make an incision over each hole with a section so that two holes protrude.
And thus make the incisions more than those which are excorrated And do not neglect any cause of expansion, but only the subtle cause which is about the veins.
And this way of castration is better than the traction, for the traction often leaves behind any cause of the testicles so that the beast desires to bite
And treat the wound until it is healed

On the care of hermaphroditism
Hermaphroditism in men is in two ways: the one is when the space between the testicles is seen to be cut in the middle where there appears to be a female organ between two testicles where there are testicles.
And some women urinate on the area of the testicles
And in women it is a kind: and that is that the woman has the sign of the female on her belly like two testicles of a man a little low and near to the navel like a man and two testicles.
And the care is of three kinds: two of the men and one of the women And that you instruct those parts adjusted until they expel the sign of that, and that you treat those with care for the other wounds
And in the second kind of men of which they urinate which is in the area of the testicles, there is no care or operation for them

On the swelling and swelling of prominent parts for the causes of women

And do not stop the inscription, especially in the premon of the reason, so that it does not cause a discharge of pus.
And take care of that which is to be cared for until it is healed
More than a wound is a wound that is not seen in the horror of great things than in the multitude of others; therefore I order you to inscribe in this way as you inscribe liquid, and care for that until it is healed.
Capitol 162.
Of the care of an abscess
An abscess is that which has no opening from the female, or has a small opening. It is natural or accidental
Accidental is for an illness which has preceded, or for a wound that has not been adjusted or for a foreign body or an ulcer
It is in the premon of the reason, or on the sides, or in the soft parts of it, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it, and prohibits any nourishment and drink and vomiting, and it is highly recommended to prohibit menstruation
And the recognition of that is sufficient regarding the womb, if the swelling is apparent, expel it; even if it is not apparent, the hour you are close to that which is in the belly or in the side
Even if the swelling is for a foreign body, and is in the two lips, the hour you touch and break that
And put your hand over the two lips and indicate with your tongue the most inflamed parts
And the womb is over the two hips, the thighs are wide apart, and extend the two lips with force until that foreign body is broken and the swelling is opened
And take clean linen and soak it in oil and place it over the area, and hold it there until the area is healed so that the wound does not solidify.
Even if the foreign body is thick and fleshy, the hour you must prescribe that it be applied with olive oil or with a leaf of myrtle
Even if the swelling is for flesh, the hour you suspend that on the thumb, and inscribe that.
And if there are medicines that stop the discharge of pus from the wound, such as alum or vinegar, and oil, and enxalz, adjust with the measure of flour
And give a wide needle of lead so that the wound is not solidified too much.
Keep that for a while and give lime ointment dry
And take care of it with the other care of consolidation until it is healed
Many times an abscess arises from other wounds, and the hour you must inscribe according to this manner. Even if there is a fistula of bones, the fistula of bones that is in the womb should not be treated contrary to the iron in any manner.

Of the care of hemorrhoids, piles and red swelling that occur in the belly of women
Hemorrhoids are appreciated from the veins of the rectum than from the veins of the buttocks continuing to discharge pus continuously; and as they are ancient hemorrhoids and are made of fat they yield readily
And I have already said in the division these kinds of things and I say that those which receive care and those which do not receive care
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and piles when they are in the premon of the reason and do not appear to the feeling, the hour there is no need for care with iron
And those which are in the orifice of the belly about which there is a sensation, those are cured
And put the womb in warm oil and extend the heel with the nails or with rough silk, and inscribe those on the roots
And thus grind over those very knees the flow of the sacred oil from one of the incisions, thus as with acacia and resembling those.
And thus soak the swollen feet for an hour, and then rest them in cold water.</start_of_turn>
And if the oil persists, then make decoction of alum and of scales of millet and of gum and of a similar kind.</start_of_turn
And thus take oatmeal and comfort that with honey and vinegar and make plaster with that over the two of them.</start_of_turn
And if the oil is evacuated, so be it; otherwise, make adhere to two sponges, and to the nipples is its sacrifice.</start_of_turn
And thus take brandy and immerse that in juice of colander or in juice of arniigold or in juice of aloe with wine vinegar and make adhere to the place; and take care of the place until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Take care of that until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Of puncture of an accident in the heel.</start_of_turn
Many species of abscesses accidental in the heel, thus as cranium and abscess lapident and ulcerous and adhubelate and erupting and fistulas hemorrhoidal and raspy and scaly and thick and other abscesses.</start_of_turn And I have already said these diseases and their species and their symptoms, and their treatments in division.</start_of_turn
And I say in this treatise of heel abscess the kind which comes with the healing abscesses, and if you wish to know how to perform the operation of them tell me.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must consider if the pain of the abscess in the heel begins acutely with percussion and bending and fever, and sometimes when it subsides and if having touched that you feel relief, in that case do not perforate it, and take care of that which helps with the maturity until the acute of the accident subsides.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must make an incision over a heel where there are two bones; recline on the heel two fingers and adjust the swollen foot to the part beyond the belly, and expand the thighs, and hold the toes away from the nails, and tie whatever is convenient.</start_of_turn
And the midwife follows behind the flank and administer the instrument with which the opening of the heel is made, the form of which will come in those causes that make it necessary.</start_of_turn
Therefore when you are administering this instrument, stay close to the ankle bone of the heel, and what enters the heel from the instrument should not be more than the ankle bone and cause harm.</start_of_turn If the instrument is larger than the ankle bone, then take powder over the texture of the ankle bone so that no instrument can enter the ankle bone.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must stop the turning that runs in the instrument from the flank and that the minister has the instrument and rotates the turning until the opening of the heel is made.</start_of_turn
And when the extrusion comes, and it is grasped with the hand and is lean and bloody, then you must stop that from which you must cover the head with a swab.</start_of_turn
And when the healing is evacuated, then you must place in the wound a sponge soaked in olive oil or green oil in which there is any swelling; and keep the heel still in the section of the ankle bone.</start_of_turn
And keep the heel still and over the wound a clean bandage soaked in water in which are boiled mallows.</start_of_turn
And take care of the wound for two days and keep it moist with that which you agree to within that time until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And many times the heel and the wound are washed with water and vinegar that is crystallized with water and honey, and with water in which there is boiled gentian or long pepper, and then return to the ointment.</start_of_turn
And if the wound is hardened in the heel with pus, then you must abstain from the treatment of it with the iron, having taken care of that which has been said in the division.</start_of_turn

The matron should be taught how to manage and treat patients with unusual figures.
A necessary cause is that the midwife should know at the beginning the natural figure of the fetus by means of its signs, for when the woman expresses from her parts and desires to smell air, and this is done over that which is above her, it is considered to be of the part, and it is painful for her, so that when this part is natural, that is, when it is in its natural figure, and when it is above the navel, and the second when it is suspended or hanging from the navel.
Therefore when you see these signs, cover the belly with your hand so that the embryo will be slightly pushed down when it comes to the navel, and that will be enough to expel the superfluities.
May be another part is not natural and not useful, for when the embryo comes out on its feet and the body comes out in front of the head and the feet, and the hand is at one side, or at the foot, that is... or the head is out and the hand is at the other side, or at the belly, and it is very great that it is converted on the navel, and it is like the unnatural figures
A necessary cause is that the midwife should be learned and skillful in all these cases, and that she should guard against error and deception.
And I show you all the figures of these things, and what is their meaning for this and for that.
When the fetus comes out naturally on the navel and that is vehement to the woman, and that is painful for her, sometimes the virtue of the hand must be taken away, or that which the women have, and it evaporates the vapor of the belly like fennel with oil of herbs.
And bring the midwife between the thighs and put a little cushion there and open that one or cut that one with your nail until you see that which is in it of humidity And press the belly of the woman until it comes out.
May be if it does not come out, cover that the woman is moistened with mucus of peas and fennel with blood.
And command her to lie down, to compress her, that it may vomit on its own; and to give her wine to drink for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled so soon as possible.
And if the two parts of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then cover that you reduce them little by little. May be if it does not obey the treatment, cover that you place the woman on a cushion and lift her legs up, and then gently press the cushion on the ground; and the woman should be kept so that she does not fall from the cushion.
And if the two parts are not expelled, and the fetus dies, then pierce those [holes] and take out the fetus immediately or tie the body to the hand and take that out too, because that which is expelled will be enough.
When the fetus comes out on the thighs, then cover those with your hand, and make the fetus small, and that you soften that, and that you take hold of one foot and gently extend those little by little.
When you see that within the thighs, then command her to vomit, and make her vomit with ease, for if God wills it, that which is expelled will be enough.
And if it is not expelled in what we have recommended, then return the fetus little by little until you see that which is in its natural figure, for that which is expelled will be the true expulsion
And if it is forbidden in all that we have recommended, then take from high and soft mucilage and dissolved gum, and pierce all over the belly for good percussion, and gently press in with your hand the vapor of the belly of the woman, the thick pus of the belly of the woman. And do this with lukewarm water, until you achieve success in the pangs of the pangs of the belly.
And when the parts of the feet are softened, then make them soften with mirta ointment and take away that. And when an hour has passed since the ointment has been applied, then put her on a cushion and make her vomit, and take away that, and lift up that [hole], and press the lower part of the belly of the woman gently, for the fetus will be expelled so soon as possible
Immediately the lateral foot hangs loosely while one of the toes is stretched out. And if it is not possible to reduce the limb, elevate the heel and allow it to go down naturally
If it is impossible to reduce it, place the hand over the thigh and with great pressure crush the parts around it, and give medicines that will cause vomiting and recommend mucus
If it is urgent, make a compress over the heel, and study how to reduce the limb, and gently restore the foot to its natural position, and command the heel to rest until it is dislocated
Immediately from the foot towards the knee the toes are expanded and the heel is two-thirds of its greatest extent. When the mistress has the foot in her hand and gently rolls it little by little, this will facilitate it.
When it is thus and when it has been reduced, and when the hand is paused over the heel where oil and mucus have been recommended
And command them to move their foot little by little, and when they are done, make the heel rest on a cushion and command it to lean towards the side, and command them to compress it; and do that until the swelling has subsided The fetus is prepared to come out sideways
When they are delivered by a violent manner as in this manner, consider, and immediately insert your finger into the second space between the nails until it is evacuated from the moisture
And if the foot is suspended over the face and the heel is protruded, immediately insert your finger into the navel, so that it is not retained and remains
And immediately pull the foot towards the thighs until it is suspended, and command the heel to rest, and command the chest to be compressed by several fingers, and when it is dislocated immediately call for a physician or God willing
The exit of twins or many fetuses together. It is known that twin fetuses born together are usually born with three or four feet, which is strange and dangerous; however, this is not always the case, for sometimes it is due to the natural causes and not to any living thing.
And concerning those, whether they be multiple or single, when they are separated by the navel strings, distinguish those that are within the umbilical cord of the mother of those that are not; for sometimes several fingers are protruded just like a foot, as it is natural, and sometimes several fingers are protruded like a foot, which is not natural, as we have recommended
And if they are difficult to deliver, you must make a compress and wait until we have mentioned the unnatural figures, and take care of them as we have recommended
And if the mistress is subtle and makes what is necessary to facilitate and expedite matters, and to be patient, and is skilled according to all the figures as she has been prepared for the danger to health.
Remember that they are formed in the womb from embryos and are aborted.
Some herbs are formed in the greater one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and ten, and indeed I must verify that a woman has borne six children, and another ten altogether, causing great pain by the measure of the learned doctors.</end_of_turn>
And thus it is known that in the science of the matron, which is strong in this matter, and therefore one must be wary of it as if of fire, for it covers everything.</end_of_turn>
Chapter LXVI.</end_of_turn>
Of the extraction of the foot when it is dead.</end_of_turn
When you cure the dead foot with water as we have said in the division of medicine and it does not go out, and you must use an operation with your hand, then you must consider whether the woman is of sound virtue and not prone to any of the accidents for which she is feared to lose her life.</end_of_turn
Then you must cover the woman over her thighs and lean her head back and elevate her buttocks.</end_of_turn
And the minister has two parts or is bound in the thigh so that the body does not extend beyond the extraction of the foot.</end_of_turn
Then moisten the mouth of the mother of the patient with oil of olive and mucus of alum and of alum and of fennel and of seed of thyme.</end_of_turn
And then join the matron your hand with those oils and mucus, and then place your hand between her hands and support the hand where the nails are in the foot.</end_of_turn
And look carefully in water: when you consider whether the foot is ready to come out over the head, and when you stay with the nails of the foot in the heel, or in the ankle, or in the mouth, or on the palate, or leave the beard, or the tonsils, or the flanks, or in the proper places of the flanks, or leave the testicles.</end_of_turn
Maybe the discharge will be on the feet of the patient, but in the fifth or in the middle of the flanks.</end_of_turn
Then hold the nail with your left hand, and suspend the curvature of the foot in the place where it is between the knuckles of the left hand, and place your hand between her hands and support the nail in some of the places that we have said, until the cause of the swelling has gone away.</end_of_turn
And then rest and stay in the position of the patient another nail, or the third if necessary, so that the attraction is equal, and not only extension according to its rule.</end_of_turn
And so be gentle in all parts, so that the swelling of the patient is relieved as much as is done in the teeth in order to eradicate it.</end_of_turn
And so be gentle in water that is between them that the extension is softened; and if any part of them is retained, then the matron must join a little oil to those parts and mix them up and rotate those that are retained.</end_of_turn
Therefore if the part of the foot is extruded, then change the nails between the places where it is more convenient; and do this until the whole foot is extruded.</end_of_turn
And if the hand is injured beforehand of the other, and it is not possible to reduce that because of the swelling of the foot, then you must cover it with a bandage over that; and extract that until the whole foot is extruded, and insert that into the palm of the hand or in the wrist.</end_of_turn
And so be careful in the other hand and in the two feet.</end_of_turn
And if the head of the foot is large, or if it has been injured by the swelling of the foot, or if there is too much water in the head, then you must place between the knuckles a cushion of sponges and cut the head and extract the water, or that you drain that with an instrument which is called “alundat”, which will be like the other instruments in the chapter that is next to this one.</end_of_turn
And so if the foot is of great head by nature: and you must insert that with an instrument, or that you support that with an alundat as we have said; and extract the bones with forceps.</end_of_turn
And if the head is injured and is contracted at the ankle, then you must cut until the moisture that is in the feet is expelled.</end_of_turn
And if it is not complicated, nor does it obey the swelling, then you must cut the head as much as you can according to your ability.</end_of_turn
And if there is pus or water in the belly or in the hydrops, then you must perforate that until the moisture that is in it is expelled.</end_of_turn
Mays si le fet es sobre les sieus pes, lahoras la atraccio de lu es leugiera e la direccio de lu a la boca de la mayre es leugiera.
If the wound is bleeding profusely, you must cover the wound with your hand and gently push the intestine or hernia back into its place.
If the other members are relaxed and the head is turned away, put your left hand inside the armpit; if the great toe is open, put your hand on the heel of the foot and with your thumb and index finger close the opening and pull the thumb and index finger towards the great toe. Then draw inside one or two fingers and pull them towards that area
If the great toe is closed by callous burning, which is what commonly happens, do not burn over it; wait until the swelling has subsided. Then you can administer ointment of greasy humors. Give plasters; and keep the patient in lukewarm water that softens and hydrates him
If the point is made on the inner side of the ankle, if possible, do so with a needle: and administer what we have said about the visible wound
If this is not possible, do a small incision in the heel, and extract it.</start_of_turn>
And make sure that you do not leave any foreign body in the wound.</start_of_turn>
When you have finished performing the operation, administer what we have said about aftercare for the callous that has occurred in the great toe.</start_of_turn>
If there is discharge of pus, send for styptic baths and administer the other care.</start_of_turn>
And I have already seen a woman in the belly of whom the fetus was dead, and on that occasion I carried out another miscarriage, and the other fetus was dead.</start_of_turn It happens that long after the miscarriage in the belly of the fetus; and when the point is made it swells up until the thumb and index finger are broken.</start_of_turn
And I was called to care for them, and I treated them for a long time, but the disease did not subside.</start_of_turn
Then I left them for a few days with strong blistering plasters, and I pulled out two bones, and after a few days I pulled out another bone; and I was amazed that there was no bone in the belly.</start_of_turn
And then I thought that they must be the bones of the dead fetus.</start_of_turn
Therefore I gave up on the wound, and I extracted from it four bones; the woman was in the fifth month of her pregnancy, and I had seen such a thing for a long time, and I was cured of her for a little while.</start_of_turn
I did not dare to believe that it was a strange thing, but that in this matter there is knowledge and help from the physician who administers artificial means to the hand for treatment.</start_of_turn
Of the forms of instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.</start_of_turn
Method of turning the foot over which the incision is made.</start_of_turn
This is the way of holding the limb so that the free hand can be used to support two turns at the two extremities of the foot.</start_of_turn But this turn must be more subtle than that of a strictor, and must be performed with the point or the heel or with the palm of the hand.</start_of_turn
And the breadth of each finger is as much as two fingers, and the width of each is as much as one finger, and the length is one palm and a half; and between two fingers there are two adjustments of that middle finger which are already fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the breadth is as much as two fingers, or a little more.</start_of_turn
And these two additional adjustments are introduced into the opening of the foot so that it is open with those two prescribed turns.</start_of_turn
Another similar method which is more subtle and lighter.</start_of_turn
Use the point or the heel or the palm of the hand according to the shape of forceps.</start_of_turn But in the end of the limb there are two additional things which sometimes happen, and the length of those additional things is one palm, and the breadth of each is two fingers.</start_of_turn
And when you wish to open the major joint, then make the female do that by lifting the feet pending, open that which is between their thighs. And bring your hand close to the instrument as if with forcep as much as is necessary until the matrix makes space for it.</end_of_turn>
The way to make the incision that the ancients called...
The way to perform the operation in which the foot is grasped.</end_of_turn>
The way to hold the great toe securely.</end_of_turn>
And it is assembled with forceps which bite at the extremity, just as sometimes, and some veins are cut thus long as forceps in this way, just as sometimes, biting like nails with which an incision is made and contained.</end_of_turn> The way to handle the little toe cautiously.</end_of_turn
The way to handle a spine without injury.</end_of_turn
The way to handle two spines without injury.</end_of_turn
The way to handle the bandage with two extremities on which the head is severed.</end_of_turn
The way of two wide bandages.</end_of_turn
All these instruments are exercises, and when they are multiplied with different species of the same and prepared must be ordered by the artificer, for the greater the curiosity of the operation and the more numerous the people, the more must they be ordered.</end_of_turn>
And do not work with these instruments wherever you will, for their necessity is not excusable.</end_of_turn
Extraction of the second [toe].</end_of_turn>
When the second toe is retained you must embolden it, and you must command the patient to release the heel, and then do that which will cause it to vomit, and strengthen your hand over the mouth and over the nails, and if by chance it should go out, well and good.</end_of_turn
And if not, then take an ointment and pierce through the covering a hole and place upon that herb which will open the mouth of the joint, thus as with calamine and rue and alum and chamomile and saffron and gum arabic and cinnamon and rue.</end_of_turn All these herbs or some of them will be submerged in water in the ointment, and place that upon the fire.</end_of_turn
And bring close a canula of ivy to the mouth of the joint, and keep that inside until the vapor reaches the cavity of the joint.</end_of_turn
And do that which we have said, and the second will be expelled with speed.</end_of_turn
More if you remain close to this care and it is not expelled, then command the matron to submerge her left hand in olive oil or in almond milk, and then insert that into the joint and press with that until the second toe has been found, and when that has happened, then take hold of it and extend that slowly More if it is attached to the heel, then insert your hand as we have recommended, and when you have found the second toe, extract that little by little according to the rule so that the joint does not suffer excessive traction.</end_of_turn Henceforward let it be done on both sides right and left with ease.</end_of_turn>
And if the mouth of the joint is closed, as we have recommended the care with turning and with the application of the ointment with herbs.</end_of_turn
More if it is not expelled by all the causes which we have recommended, then keep that you do not tire over that in the attempt of extraction, more however that what comes out of it at the mouth of the joint lies in the space of the heel, and then crystallize that with gum and tetracycline; for that will cause that to dissolve in a few days and will be expelled.</end_of_turn
More when it is placed, let there be a bad smell at the head and at the stomach, and that which leads to the patient; and then know that sub-fumiguous things and convenient things must be administered to it.</end_of_turn
The ancient physicians already knew of the sub-fumigation of nitrogen and dry figures.
A means of an instrument with which the female is sub-fumigated due to the retention of menses and of the secondaries:
Whether by vision or by touch
And let the middle limb be grasped in the groin and the wide limb over the fire, and let the sub-fumigation be done over the arms of the fire.
And keep her who will consume that sub-fumigation and repeat it again
With care of the buttocks of the unperforated child
The children groan and their buttocks are not perforated, which already irritate the bowels and swell up Then cover the matron that she perforate at the said place; and if not, perforate at the spleen that is acute, and guard that it does not touch the liver
And let your hand rest on that cloth soaked in wine and oil; and keep that one inside until it is sent back.<end_turn>
And if you fear that it is swollen, let your hand rest in the wound a needle for a few days, and keep it until the child will be able to digest again<end_turn
And already in cases of swelling of the buttocks by consolidation of pus or of abscess; then cover that consolidation is not infected, and let it be cured with that which has been said of the care and of the plaster.
Care of the fistulas that arise from the bowels.
The fistulas that arise in the lower parts of the bowels are nodular and bulky, which arise from the spleen or in the space of the intestines
And it is a fistula or a tumor
And when that nodule is old and corrupt with the white or pale humidity, and some veins are of these fistulas, some penetrate.
And those that penetrate are known by the fact that it is ejected by those for the evacuation and for the wind; and some physicians use the evil of evacuation, and it is ejected from those veins.
And from these fistulas some veins penetrate into the bladder, and into the meat of the heel; and some penetrate into the hip joint and into the groin
And what is known of the penetrating fistula is when the physician has said that it is in the buttocks, and has attempted to remove it with the hand or with the instrument when it is tough.
And if it is tough, let you enter in that attempt with a plaster or horsehair until you sit on the attempt or put it in the buttock
And if you do not feel that from the bowels any cause of vomiting or diarrhea or wind, as we have said, then consider that it is not penetrating, and let you attend to the care
And when the fistula penetrates the bladder or the meat of the heel, the meaning of it is the emission of urine from that and prohibition of doing so until such time as the doctor has consolidated it
And if it penetrates the hip joint or the bone and causes pain in the limb, the sign of it is that the attempt has gone wrong if not tough on the bone, and that it is painful in the limb; and that from it will result a softening of all; and that in this case it is not useful for this medicine, and that it is not consolidated at once
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no cure for all, and the cure for them is the work and the effort of the doctors who have been commanded about it.
And in that one that is not penetrating and not antiquated, healing with iron is hoped for as I will tell you to recommend and that which I have already tried
And that the evil of the disease lies between your two thighs and raises your legs inside you, the thighs are inclined towards your belly, and let you enter with an attempt of plaster, or with the hand if it is in the fistula, until you see that the attempt has not gone wrong
And if the evil of the disease surrounds the buttocks, let you know that you have said it correctly in the buttocks
And if you put your hand on the buttock the attempt has already penetrated; or if you put it between the buttock and that hip or that thigh, then you are certain that it has penetrated; and do not work in that, for it is not in that cure, as we have said
May he indeed say that it is healthy in many homes at the start.
And as for the medicine for which there is hope of success in them is that you ignite the cautery subtly according to the extent of the fistula, thus as it has been said before, and introduce that flame into the fistula until it reaches around the whole circumference; and then repeat that process two or three times until you see that all those tissues surrounding the fistula that resemble feathers of a sparrow have already been cauterized.</end_of_turn>
And thus care for those who are wrapped in borders until all those tissues which have been cauterized are no longer soft; and care for those who take medicine which engenders and consolidates the flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; but if not, it is not healed at any other time by any other treatment.</end_of_turn>
And if the attempt is made to enter, and does not penetrate inside the said cavity, between that and the attempt which is very special for flesh or cartilage, and sometimes the fistula in which it seeps the surface of the heel, then dry the heel from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see it dry on the attempt, and that it is freed both from the fistula and from the limb itself.</end_of_turn
And thus soften those tissues which are cauterized which resemble a quill of sparrow and do not remain from any cause.</end_of_turn>
May he indeed say that sometimes when blood flows and pus comes between you and your operation when you burn those tissues, it is better to burn with fire or acute medicine, because the burning of fire adjusts well many good things: it is the adhesion of those tissues which have been cauterized, and the excision of the blood excrete the humors.</end_of_turn
And thus care for those who are wrapped in borders or in causing distress until the limb gets well braced, and thus care for the wound as long as there is hardened flesh engendered and consolidated.</end_of_turn
And so medicines in which there is both styptic action and excision; when the limb is restored it is healed and you do not fear repetition.</end_of_turn>
May he indeed say that if the fistula has already gone into the pelvic region and extends from its surface to the body, then enter the cavity of the pelvis and inquire about that.</end_of_turn
And thus if you concentrate the attempt and between you and it is very likely cartilage or flesh, and it is probable that it will penetrate, it is not an operation in them but according to the way of faith and hope.</end_of_turn
The cause is to administer in them in three ways: either that you burn that in the way that has been said; or that you extract that until you achieve the concavity of the limb so that it is possible for you to enter the parts and the treatment to proceed; and do not proceed without slicing so that you do not injure the surrounding parts, and take care of the patient in every way except for the will of the disease; or that you lengthen that which is very likely and pronounce that pus which you dry up in this way, as has been said, or with the hand or another acute instrument, and thus soften those tissues which are cauterized which are in the section that must be cut; and finally force you to restore the whole wound in the section, and if the discharge of pus does not consolidate, and the fistula remains open in the buttock, and if there is still pus left in the wound, then fear for the patient.</end_of_turn And sometimes the fistula is finished in this way: when you enter the thumb into the fistula, and it is at the waist of the buttock around the surface of the body and on the margin of the buttock, the thumb tries to perforate the limb, which is just like the needle of preparation of the tissues in this way.
and you enter in that faithful envelope of veins or around those; and take hold of the thumb with the faithful hand in the fistula until you achieve the concavity of the limb.</end_of_turn>
May he indeed say that if it penetrates the margin of the buttock properly withdraw the vein from that hole as soon as you have entered the cavity of the pelvis; extract the limb from the vein and adjust the two limbs together, and rest each one, and wash what is necessary for one or two days, and when it has subsided again insert the vein into the flesh, rest that until those tissues which are between the two extremities of the vein have become callous.</end_of_turn
And thus care for the wound until it is consolidated and healed.</end_of_turn
May he indeed say that if the discharge of the fistula is not penetrating, the way to make it penetrate, in whatever way you prepare it, is not in the cavity, for it is not your business to make it suffer; and thus do that which is necessary until it is healed.</end_of_turn
The shape of the spatum spine is such that its curvature is neither acute nor obtuse, so that nothing unnecessary is inscribed upon it, even as is sometimes the case.
From the suture of the wounds in which blood runs clean at the incision of those.
Wounds are of two kinds, those that are between the buttocks as if of charcoal, or those that are like drops of rain. And of those, some are small and some are large, and that blood runs from all of them together, and is one, neither too little nor too much, neither too high nor too low.
But indeed those that are outside the buttocks are according to the months of little humidity, of which runs citrine water or a little of blood with continuous color, and according to the color of the wound.
And the care of that which is outside the buttocks is that you command the patient to relax and express himself until the swelling subsides and the wounds appear again. Then you lie down and suspend yourself with nails or that you have them on your nails, and then you can apply those things to the wound
But if the nails do not hold in those because of the humidity of them and the softening of them, then take them out rough or blunt or flaccid of wool, and extract them from the gut, and then apply them to the wound. And care for them like with the other care until they are healed.
And if the buttocks do not obey discharge, then command the patient to lie in a small bed and wash them with the water in the gut, and that he discharge willingly when the patient is relaxed.
But if the wounds are outside the buttocks, the cause of them is light, and it is that you take them with your nails, or that you take them with a needle, and insert them, and then care for them with the water that has been said until they are healed
And whoever has a wound, cover that you administer suture to him according to this manner: take fine thread and put it on a needle and then extract the wounds to the upper parts, and make that penetrate through the needle at the root of the other part, and wrap the two extremities of the thread in the part beyond the needle, and so latitudinally; and tighten the wound with a strong stretch, and then tie the thread securely and extract the needle.
And do all this, and leave them one and do not close them, so that the surplus of blood runs from that.
And put a bandage on the buttocks soaked in olive oil or in cerate; and put that on the gut and command the patient to rest. And leave that until the box is gone; and when it is gone, care for them with bandage or another care until they are healed.
And as these are ancient and have no value in that medicine, when you see that they are useful for humid humors and are hosted by the thick pus that prevents them from solidifying; then care for them until they are solidified
Then keep them moist with greater reason than at first until the wound is healed and is scabbed over; and care for them until they are healed
You must know that to blanch is key, and it is not without notice that you notice red around the color of the skin resembling a claw, and that it is useful in all the body and especially in the parts below the feet and the buttocks, and because of those pains you must support them
And when you see that there is water in the circuit of the claw, and that it is held with nails or a needle, and that it is eradicated from its root; then care for that
Or if you wish, cauterize them as it is said in the preceding chapter
But a pimple is a small, rough, round swelling on the surface of the body, and many are seen in the majority of children
The care of them is that you extend and inscribe them, or that you cut them open with a knife or from within the box. And if you wish, cauterize that as we have said, with fire or acute medicine.
More than that, there is a small reddish swelling or large fistula on the surface of the body moving in the groin, and when it is cold it appears like the bite of a wasp, and this is the cause of the pain in the body.
And the care of them is that you take a needle of fine awl or needle of vulture, and that it is strong, and place that over the wasp within which you contain its circle with the needle of the parts of the body; and then rotate your hand over the needle until you have inscribed what is in the circuit of the wasp, and place that in the groin of the body and evacuate the wasp from its root
And if you wish, do that with a needle of ivory or iron in this way:
The tip of the needle should be grasped by the substance, deaf (so that it is not perforated), covered so that over the thumb the learning of the hand is ablated and the rotation of that.</start_turn>
And if you wish, cauterize the wasp as it is said above in the section of cautery of the heel.</start_turn
Concerning the instruments that are administered to give comfort.</start_turn>
Some unguents are useful for comfort of silver or lead or ivory or malleable; and some unguents are useful for those small instruments big or small according to those which are administered, for whoever is administered in the care of the little children should be small; and of those whose buttocks are frail or painful, the comforts of those shall be small.</start_turn
The way of giving great and few comforts:</start_turn
The head of the needle in which the bag is bound is wide according to this manner; and let there be a distinction between where the bag is bound thus as many times.</start_turn
And the extremity of the limb which is inserted into the buttock, which is entered behind the loin, is deaf (so that it is not opened) like a lion, backward toward the substance; and on one side of the limb are two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the breadth of the hole is according to the size of the rays and the bigger the greater.</start_turn
And let the bag be in which the medicines of bladder of beast or of sheepskin are placed, and the root of it be a palm.</start_turn
And let it be pierced by means of four holes thus as it is rotated; and if the space which is between the holes is the thickness of the finger.</start_turn
And thus insert into those holes firmly with firm thread, or send those; and adjust that with that which is appropriate for that; and when it is placed in it the bag, let it be straight in the head of the comfort between two distinguished things with firm constraint, and almost comfort that which is in each hole: More the quality of comfort that is that you fill the bag with medicine, that is scalded according to the quantity of the tolerance of the patient; and take care that it is not too cold or too hot.</start_turn
And thus the patient shall rest on the two hips, and lift up their limbs over their knees and place under them a cushion upon which they have lain or a cushion; and let them anoint the limb with oil or with balm of oil or with ointment of fenugreek or of some other similar; and let them insert that into the buttock with ease, and let the minister hold the bag and express that out through two more and express that with force until it is evacuated from the belly all that is in the comfort; and then extract the comfort and the patient takes their limbs to the wall.</start_turn
And if the medicine forces that to happen, keep it as much as you can; and if he sleeps with that for the whole night, it is better in recovery.</start_turn
More if you comfort that in the belly troubles and the swelling of it, the hours that you rotate the needle until it is healed.</start_turn
And if in the buttock there are wounds or bleeding abscesses, let the comfort be soft and like that of the comforts with which the children are accustomed.</start_turn
Care of the plague.</start_turn
And I have already said in the division of the care of the plague that which was suitable for the free, and I say thus the care of those with hands and with medicines according to the compliment.</start_turn
Therefore I say that fevers are diversely classified according to the nature of the humors which cause them and according to the location of the parts affected by the fever.
The causes of these fevers are diverse, such as kidney stones, incision of space or spleen, percussion at the lung, or at the gut, or by bite or splinter, or like those which cause ordinary fevers.</end_of_turn>
The fevers which are in the parts of the body are also like those which are in the head, or the collar, or the feet, or the belly, or the groin, or the limbs.</end_of_turn>
And I recommend the treatment of several fevers in order to avoid that ratiocination and rule regarding the others.</end_of_turn>
I will begin with the simple fevers of the head, for the memory of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.</end_of_turn>
Therefore I say that when an acute simple fever occurs in the head and is not a fracture, consider the following: if it is due to kidney stone or something similar, and if the patient has already vomited once, it is a great fever and you should fear that there is imminent vomiting. In this case you should cover the patient and give them emetics as soon as possible; and extract according to the amount of the virtue in the emetic if no other cause forbids emesis, especially if the emetic is taken from the body of the patient.
And let vomiting be opposite to the side affected by the fever; and guard the patient from repletion and from drink and from coarse food.</end_of_turn
If the minimum indicates that any cause is prohibited, then you must abstain from food and do not approach meat or drink.</end_of_turn
And rest upon the fever, if vomiting occurs with the cautery, smear ointment of rue over the soles of the feet or in wine which is stipticated.</end_of_turn
And if you are certain that there is vomiting with the cautery, rest upon the fever until the patient is well and the air has not changed that powder which I recommend taking in small quantity.</end_of_turn
And if the air has already changed that, rest upon rest until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the fever is great or for incision of space or for something similar, and the pulse is not adjusted for the pupils, adjust those as I recommend for their suture according to what I recommend for their suture.</end_of_turn
And if the fever is already discovered from the bone and skin, and is not retention but a small swelling, then prick that and immediately apply medicines to the fever and restore the patient by giving them food other than vomit: heads and cabbage and similar things until it is cured.</end_of_turn
And if you find putrefaction in the vomit and it does not adhere to the bone, prick everything that may be putrefied and evacuate it, and immediately apply medicine to it.</end_of_turn
And if in these fevers there is an artery or vein from which blood flows which can cause death if not treated by medicine, and which is not separated by medicine, inquire about the artery; and if you find that it is not separated, prick that part or ligate that; and if necessary, because of what we have said, cauterize until the blood is separated.</end_of_turn
And if these fevers are simple and small, the cause of them is slight; in this way that you powder over those things which cause the air to change those.</end_of_turn
And the manner of making the powder is as follows: take one part of olive oil, two parts of bloodroot, three parts of nonspecific cause; mix them all together and grind them, and let the fever be covered with it, and let it be bound with good constriction until it is over that to which it adheres, and let it be coagulated with the blood.</end_of_turn
Then strengthen that with dust and read that, and do not remove it while it is still moist, because it is not recommended by medicine until it is cured.</end_of_turn>
And every time makes this only with cautery when not in the presence of oil and bloodroot.</end_of_turn
And this same remedy is often used in great fevers when you consider that it should be interrupted over those and that they are stretched, and only for recent fevers in which the patient's blood has not been altered.</end_of_turn
And if the blood has already been altered, especially in summer, I do not understand the position of this powder, more than that you should take care of those things which we have said, in this way that you interrupt them with fasting, or that you interrupt them with barley broth or honey until they are digested; and take care of those things with the other treatment until they are cured.</end_of_turn
If an accident happens on the fracture in the limb, even if it is small, you must extract it from the limb with your hand.
And I say the treatment of fractures in the head is in poison.
Of the plagues of the belly.
If the plague happens in the belly, however, it is not different in medication, and between the plague of the head when it is simple.
If the nerve of the belly is cut or an artery, however, if it is a nerve, it is not in its engineering but that it should be avoided by treatment with that which makes stricture, just as with zinc and celery which is old and similar to them because it does not cause swelling of the nerves and counteracts that. And do not stop about the plague of any cause of great fear, because the substance of the nerves is cold and the continuation of them is at the brain, which is the source of all members.
And if it must be cured by medicines that are lighter, even as in the cause of washing with lukewarm water, any vegetable boiled in olive oil or not-olive oil, and drink it when washed with lukewarm water and the other parts should be treated in the same way as before, and add humidity.
If the plague is great, however, administer sutures or bandage the edges of the wound, and treat that with powders until it is healed.
If the plague is depth or has happened to the lower part of the limb, however, perforate that in the place most depressed.
If in the plague an artery has already been cut and blood flow has been achieved, however, separate or dry that, or ligate that, or cauterize that if necessary to prevent excessive bleeding
If the vertebrae of the groin or all of them have already been cut, and the veins of the belly have been saved, however, you adjust the edges of the thigh with sutures over the hip bone and do not touch that; pull that equal and reduce that to its natural position, and strengthen that by stretching downwards, and let that rest for a few days; and treat that by adding anything that causes stricture and excitement until it is healed.
If the plague has already caused damage to the bone, however, pierce that, and if there are fragments of bone, extract them all; and what is not displaced, let that rest until the plague has subsided, and separate and relieve the discharge of it.
And if the plague is recent, sprinkle over that powder the one that has been recommended to you. If there is a fistula in the plague, however, treat that with the water from which the memory will come to you in the head.
If it is percussion of the flank or the chest, and sometimes of the belly, and the depth of it, however, consider more if it is of the plague that there is a wind in the patient; the physician must know that the plague is deadly
And if it is not depth and the plague is recent in the belly, however, you stop in it for the first hour powder, and do not strengthen that because it will not retain the blood in the depth of it and will return to the heart and cause the patient’s condition to worsen, more than anything stop in it at that moment, and remove those two vegetables that you give him.
And if the vomit is not to you present, however, you stop at the orifice of the plague for a long time because it sucks up what is in the humors; and make the patient sleep on the plague so that the humor that is in it runs away.
If already three days have passed or more of the plague and the patient does not have spasms or convulsions of the body or bad chest pain or stricture of the bowels, and sometimes other good signs of the patient, however, the physician must know that the plague is saved; and then treat that with calamine and other treatments until it is healed
If the healing is excused, and the time has already passed, however, the physician must know that the fistula has already healed; treat that for the head of the bed
And if the plague is for incision of space or chest, and is simple on the surface of the foot or the thigh, however, treat that with water that precedes the suture, if it is great, or with powder if it is small.
If already damage has been caused to the bone, and only fragments remain, however, you twist the plague and cover to extract those fragments, if they are separated May it be that if they are not separated, the latter will read the former that the extraction of the plague is alleviated.
And as for the other plagues that happen in the other members, their care helps in the treatment of this one.
From the belly plagues.
The indisposition that happens in the belly is great, or little, or moderate.</end_of_turn>
A small disruption is harmful in another way, and if indeed the reduction of them is more difficult, if you do not restrain the introversion of them into the belly as much as possible, it will open and become swollen because their contents are harmful.</end_of_turn>
Therefore the better disruption is moderate, because in that one the reduction of the belly is not difficult, even though it is difficult in the two preceding species.</end_of_turn
And it is known that the suture of the belly is done in four ways, but two sutures are common that are convenient in the sutures of the other plagues of the body.</end_of_turn
And two other sutures are proper for the other plagues, but indeed they are more proper in the suture of the belly.</end_of_turn
I recommend to you that you keep any exposure and declaration.</end_of_turn>
Therefore I say that when the plague is small and there is any cause of the belly for that, and it is difficult to reduce that, the hour that is in one of these two ways: either because of the smallness of the disruption as we have said, or when the belly is affected with excessive inflammation due to the cold of the air.</end_of_turn
Therefore when it is like this, the hour covers that you should cover that with a sponge soaked in warm water alone, or that you grasp in water squinching, and cypress, and pepper, and cloves until the inflammation is resolved.</end_of_turn
Some herbs make that which has styptic action, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.</end_of_turn
Therefore when the inflammation is resolved, the hour you moisten the belly with water in which it is covered with salt and mallow, because by this the contents of it are alleviated with little cause.</end_of_turn
But if the contents of it must be removed immediately for this treatment, the hour you cut the disruption with a small instrument with which they are incised wounds.</end_of_turn
The first treatment is better when it is proper that it is not dry, and that it should not be necessary to dry immediately what is not necessary and defnourished.</end_of_turn
Of the instrument, how its shape is:
One part is sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the extremity is thin, and it should not be as wide as a palm, be it obtuse a little.</end_of_turn
And when the plague is increased and is outside the belly, the hour covers that its reduction should be according to its natural form, in the belly itself, if possible over water, because that is better.</end_of_turn
But when the disruption is wide, and is in the lower part of the belly, the hour covers that you should place the patient on the two sides, and suspend their limbs higher than the head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, the hour you suspend the head and the hands more than the other parts.</end_of_turn
Similarly if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, the hour suspends your attention and your consideration at all times in this way that the part where the plague is may be higher than the other.</end_of_turn
And thus it covers that you administer water in the great plagues and in the small plagues.</end_of_turn
And in the small plagues, suspend water that is at your preparation, and make it so that the ministering is between your greatest patients, who have the whole disruption with their hand and adjust the lips of them, and thus uncover from that to that which if there is any cause of any other suture.</end_of_turn
And this is the common suture technique: to grasp the needle, or the handle of the needle according to the quantity of the amplitude of the plague; and to place the knot at the extremity of the disruption of the ring finger, and to tighten the needle once, or twice as you do not want to fail in the two extremities of the coccyx, at the two extremities of the hip which is left by the coccyx of the parts inwards, until you have pierced from that part; and you have already added two extremities of the coccyx and two extremities of the hip, so that there are four orders altogether.</end_of_turn
And thus strengthen the thumb double in the circuit of the needle, and some veins from two parts together, and gather the two lips and the plague together by descent; and then remove the thickness of the digit and fix another needle in that place; and then bind that thumb thus as before with the first needle; and do not cease until the entire contraction of the plague is complete.
And the needles must move between fat and lean, because the fine needles do not bite excessively; and the thick ones are difficult to pass through the skin, and therefore because of this it is better that they move in leanness and fatness.
And do not let the needle be placed at two extremities of the skin too close together, for so the skin will not be excessively bitten and the plague will open before its consolidation.
And do not prolong the suture too much, for the plague will be hindered from consolidating.</end_turn>
And then puncture the extremities of the needles so that they do not cause the patient excessive pain; and stop when the suture is pulled taut from every part, which has the extremities of the needles; and leave them in place until you know that the plague has already consolidated.</end_turn>
These methods of suture with needles in cold handling are more convenient in small plagues, for they require only one or two needles around or near them.</end_turn>
The second suture is more common: and it is that you administer the suture to the four extremities, that is, the skin and two extremities of the heel, in a single vein, with a needle in which the gut is firmly enclosed in leanness and fatness.</end_turn
And when the needle has pierced these four extremities, reduce the needle from that middle part from which you began, so that the gut that remains is contained by the suture and is not pulled out by the surrounding swelling, for so the suture is stronger like the previous one.</end_turn
And stop between each suture the amount of the thickness of the thumb mentioned.</end_turn
This suture is dangerous for women.</end_turn>
And in such a suture I saw that the plague which had affected a man in his belly was being cured by a blister which had appeared on the plague of a palm, and that was the rupture of the greatest plague of a palm, and it was seen from around two palms of the belly to the middle of the limb; and when I had reduced that until the belly had escaped from the plague for xxx hours.</end_turn
And the plague was consolidated within fifteen days or thereabouts, and it was cured; and thus I saw that after that it was no longer necessary to take any medicine, and that is confirmed in its reports.</end_turn
And other doctors had given up hope that it would not recover; but by a miracle, behold, it recovered, for in that place neither remedy nor any medicine was found, except that I kept pouring vinegar over the plague twice a day and rubbing it with warm water until it healed.</end_turn
But I tell two special methods of suture according to the narration of Paraula.</end_turn
And you begin the suture from the hip, and enter the needle from the back of the heel to the front.</end_turn
And thus when the needle pierces the hip and in that middle lacerates according to the rule and in length throughout the body, and leave the heel in which you have introduced the needle; and make the other extremity pierce the needle from the back of the heel to the front of the heel in the other extremity of the limb.</end_turn
And thus when you have finished that perforation, then make another perforation in that middle part of the limb from the heel to the toe; and leave the heel that is in that incision, and make the needle pierce from the back of the heel to the front of the heel in the other extremity of the limb.</end_turn
And make the needle pierce in such a way that when it pierces that which you have pierced in the heel, that in that part of the limb where the gut has been introduced, that is, in the middle of the limb, until that part has passed through.
And thus start from this middle side and pull out the needle that has pierced, and reduce that in that hip and close the heel that is on the other side of the limb to this heel; and pull out the other needle from the hip.</end_turn
And do this twice and another time, and do this until you have passed through all that is before according to that example.</end_turn
The sum of this manner of stitching is that you sew through the skin with the thread, and as you sew through, you cut a portion of the edge of the wound from the part of the extremity of the knee, and when you have finished sewing, you read that portion again to make sure it is complete.</li></ul>
The second kind of stitching that we speak of is called Gualia, and this is what we recommend. It is to sew in the same manner as some doctors sew, adding all around to the surrounding area as seems convenient for nature; and then stretch the limb of the patient against the limb of the witness to the other limb, and that is done as I have recommended to you.</li></ul
Since you have left the needle in the witness's limb at your request, pass the needle through the inside of the wound in that place, and read two marks; and then withdraw the needle and make the puncture from outside to inside through two marks.
And then withdraw the incisions, and make punctures in any part of the wound that you deem necessary from outside to inside through two other marks.</li></ul
This manner of stitching is better than the common ligation and is called the suture of remembrance.</li></ul
This is the word Gualia.</li></ul>
And I will tell you, the belly suture is rectified with two needles, so that you enter with these into any place of the gut, and begin with the needle from which you wish, and make the puncture through to the other side according to the suture of those which sew the body together.</li></ul
And you know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, the suture of it is more difficult than that of the other parts of the belly.</li></ul
More than the judgment of the plague is the judgment of the other plagues.</li></ul
The cause of which is that when you perceive the recent plague to be over and the air changes so that it becomes dry, reduce the swelling and sew that up and apply that ointment suitably. Then pause over that fleshy powder.</li></ul
And if the air has already changed the plague, then pause over that until the swelling subsides and the wounds harden and become solid; and consolidate the limb and the witness; and care for that as is the care of the other plagues until it is healed.</li></ul
And if you do not have the medicines at hand, then pause over that for a while, for it begins to swell up, swell more than before, and exchange that which you give two veins, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you should not give any other medicine in large quantities when the plague is simple.</li></ul
And if you fear that the plague will communicate infection to the principal parts, then cover that with liquid lion in olive oil of good quality, or in scented oil, and keep that in the circuit of the places that are between the armpits and leave the armpits open.</li></ul
And if there is pain or putrefaction in the swollen parts, when many veins are closed, then administer that medicine with black vitriol, especially if the swelling has spread to the belly and it is necessary to make an incision to drain it.</li></ul
And you know that the one that is in the large belly is easier to heal than the one that is in the small belly.</li></ul
And it is of difficult healing because the belly which is called “gegunu” does not receive the healing of the plague that is in it; and that is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and for the greatness of it, and for the subtlety of the body of that, and for its proximity to nature.</li></ul
And if what proceeds from the plague is the cloth, and if you have just recently recognized it, reduce it according to your custom in which you reduce the swelling of the belly.</li></ul
And if it has passed the space and is already green or black, then strengthen that with a thread over the place that is injured, so that there comes out flow of healing, for there are veins and arteries in the cloth.</li></ul
And then insert what is another thread there, and pause the two extremities of the thread pending the departure of the plague from that place, so that over you there is relieved the attraction of that towards the thread and the emission of the plague.</li></ul
Remember the plagues when they happened in the belly.</li></ul
When disruption happens in the belly and it is slight, it is possible that it will remain in the household to help so that you see which one was affected in the belly with percussion of the hand and was the plague of the lower part of the stomach, and the plague was old and finished fistula, and there was discharge of it through the handling and winds.</li></ul
Adonc yeu pansegui la curacio de lu ja sia che non era confizat in la sanacio de lu, mays cessegui subtiliare aquel entro che foc sanat e le loc es consolidat.
And I say that when the limb is already consolidated, time to address the ailment that occurred in the belly; and do not think of anything that could cause greater harm in this matter, for you remain at your disposal with food and drink, and I shall enter in bathing and exercise in these things.
And I say that some experienced people say that when there is a small wound in the belly, the following should be done: take large amounts of powdered alum; then adjust the two lips of the wound and place a little of the alum on the edge of the wound, so that when you press on that and open your mouth, the head of the wound will tear away, which adheres and is not dissolved
And so place another little of alum on the first wound and do not stop until you have put as much alum as the size of the whole wound
Then return the wound and close the wound; leave the heads of the nails annexed in the belly until the belly is healed; do not cause any harm to the patient at night.
And indeed it is possible that the belly is joined by a fine thread that is useful for the belly of an animal that is more needle-like; take the extremity of these threads from the belly and do not remove it, and with your hand tie the extremity of the thread to the firm thread, encircling it, and then push that thread through the hole and close the wound with that thread, reducing that in the disruption
This method of stitching with alum is nothing but by trust and hope.
However if the wound is large and wide, mostly if it is in the delicate belly, which is not easily healed, and is not the healing of the whole
Take care of the ulcer and fistula.
You know that all wound and swelling when it grows old becomes an ulcer, and that it is useful for an ulcer, and not for its consolidation, and gets its arm at all times and is not torn, when in whatever member it is, it is universally called fistula and we call that swelling an ulcer.
And fistula truly is a foul, tough, white swelling that does not cause pain and which is concave like the swelling of a boil; and for this reason it is called an ulcer risk, that is, a boil
And it is in ulcerous patients that the humors grow wet; and that soon they are expelled in a few hours. And many people see this humidity moving, and it is little, and it is large, and it is fine
I have already shown all those causes, and the symptoms of them and their treatment with medicines in the division.
And I tell you that I will tell you the treatment of fistula, which is useful by surgery with the hand
You know that fistula can happen in all parts of the body; that some are fistulas that go to the great veins and arteries, or to the nerves, or to the pericardium, or to the belly, or to the bladder, or to the spine, or to any of the joints composed of composition as well as that of the hand and the foot; and of those that give proximity to the main limb and resemblance.
Therefore that fistula which is in this way is of the diseases of difficult healing, and does not receive cure, and is accompanied by work and ignorance
If it is of any fistula the depth of which does not reach these places that I have said, and you expect and trust in the treatment of it, and you wish to learn about it, when you take hold or with the needle, and if the fistula goes according to the rule, inquire about it from me
If the fistula is twisted, then investigate which part attempts to swell up, for the swelling of the body is alleviated and curved away from the twist.
And if the fistula has not moved excessively, it is not possible that it signifies that it attempts to rise
Therefore criticize the orifice for its orifices, for the humidity which you criticize causes them to flow out from the others.
And thus inquire diligently, according to what manner you are able, whether here are any nerves or bones, and whether the fistula is long or short, or whether it is a fistula from which several orifices protrude, and this is upon which you must depend for all that you have learned, for your experience, for which you inquire about the patient, and the invention of pain due to your compression of the hand over the area, and the resemblance of the symptoms and the accidental causes to the apostema
And when you have considered all of those causes that are at rest, then go to the cure with confidence: and consider whether the fistula is apparent or near the surface, long from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the places that you have mentioned and which you know well
Then dry the fistula as it is said in the report, and keep it away from anything that is in that filtration and putrefaction, and from anything that is born in the orifice of the body, or from pus and from resemblance, and cure it until it is healed
If the fistula is of great depth, and is according to the rule, then you must insert it into the area as much as you can tolerate, and immediately soften all of its putrefying parts; and immediately administer calamine-covered powders with acute medicines, and introduce them into the cavity of the fistula, which you have grasped with iron
And do thus until any vegetables that are within are consumed by the acute medicine until the corruption of the cavity of the fistula is healed
And thus restore that which engenders healthy flesh until it is healed
If it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recommended
If the cause of the fistula is bone and is due to you, then you inquire about it and dry it as we have recommended, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or major limb as we have said
If it is in you that the bone is discovered and is in any corruption and blackness, then you should remove it until the corruption is completely eliminated; and immediately cure that which is in it until it is healed
And if it is not healed and gives you pain even as you make it, then you must know that you have not arrived at the complete eradication of the corruption; and then you should uncover it further and inquire diligently about it and make the reason for it and the modification of it stronger, and restore that
And thus if it is healed, well and good; but if not, you must know that that corruption is in the profound depth of the body, which has not been achieved, and then you must take away that which is not useful except to lay that aside.
And if the corruption is small, or if you are able to pull it out, then you pull it out with fine forceps which are convenient for this purpose
And if there is movement of bones, then you inquire diligently about the extraction of all of them, and of those do not leave any cause for your strength.
If there is any contradiction from any of the humors, and in their beginning there is no fear or error, then you should cut those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and deliver the bones.
If you are not prepared to remove the bones at your time, then you should rest upon the plague that surrounds the wound that you have made, and leave that until the bones of flesh and ligaments are away from it, and guard the wound that it does not consolidate, and keep the incision that you have made in your operation restrained
If you are afraid, rest upon the edge submerged in sopor of treacle with olive oil, or a submerged limb in Egyptian unguent, or in something of those things which when applied will soften those ligaments, and when the bones are separated from the wound, and from those the attraction is relieved
If it is a great bone such as the bone of the limb or the bone of the thigh or something like those, and what is corrupted is only the front of it, then you should remove that only as far as necessary until the blackness and corruption are eliminated, and immediately restore the wound.
May be if that which is corrupted is great in part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, it is necessary to close that and all that incides within to the place where the corruption has reached, and thus to cure that which is within when it is consolidated.
And I recommend to you that you send a man to a companion in his bed so that he may stay with him and assist with your operation.
For a young man in his prime, who has occurred pain in his groin, and from the parts that accompany the maudlin matter is above the matter of the body within which the matter has reached the groin, and it is matter of great apostematosis, and not of an extrinsic cause
And thus the time is extended for the error of the doctors until the apostematosis is healed, and I reduce the matter that is not necessary, and the cure is to be sought as soon as the wound is formed, and makes pains in them motor skills that all of them recover quickly and the humors of the body.
And thus are cured many of the doctors in two years, and I know not of any who have known this art, except that I have been called
And I saw the wound of the limb and the matter running from the orifice for great pain; and already the color of that man’s body was pale and his complexion was yellow
And thus I introduced the hook into one of those orifices and reached the hook to the bone.
And I immediately inspected all the orifices and found that they had all become infected throughout the wound
And thus I closed my eyes and made a incision in one of those orifices through which I extracted a piece of the bone, and I stopped that corruption, which was already dead and rotten, and which had already become corrupted in that place.
And thus I took what was said to me and prepared it from the bone uncovered
I declare that it was not in the bone but that corruption which I extracted and treated, and I had already drained it
And thus I stopped the restoration of the plague with consolidated medicine for a long time, and it has not been consolidated
And thus I repeated and discovered again on the bone according to the first discovery, and I found that the corruption continued in the bone itself.
I declare that to me appeared from that corruption, and thus I performed the treatment of the disease and the restoration, and it has not been restored
And thus I found about the other ulcer which does not cease to spread little by little throughout the bone, and I perforated the restoration of the limb, and it has not been restored until it has spread throughout half of the limb, and I extracted that with the marrow, and I restored that with medicines, and it has been consolidated firmly and healthily
And it is not necessary to repeat the operation of the limb and the section of the limb except for the possibility of the patient’s aversion and for the scarcity of the tolerance of the limb and for fear of death, which is present in all hours in excess of unnecessary evacuation without any benefit.
And thus is health for whole healing, and nothing is like the hardness of the bone; and it is good to have the possibility of the limb in the whole body and to restore its virtue; and it is conserved in its possibilities and does not cause it to be contradicted in walking or sleeping or in any other case.
However if it is prominent in the limb already brought about, the time has come to perform this in this manner: take ligament and tighten that at the extremity of that prominent limb; and command someone to extend that limb for you; and cut that ligament of wool thicker than the first ligament; and then lay that over the bone that you leave behind the limb, and extend the limb so that you drive the bone to the parts beyond, and uncover the bone over the place you wish to close, so that the suture does not damage the bone.
And pause for a while or a table that leaves the limb well enough, for when you do that you do not prevent the sawing that does not cut the corrupted bone
And keep that the suture be small over the corrupted place, for if it is in the cavity of the bone corruption and does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and forces the closure of the other ulcer.
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, advance one part continuously with the other, and the corruption is in the middle of the limb or in part of it, then uncover the bone throughout; and immediately pause the fist and then cut that which is the first part where the corruption is, until the suture of the other part is completed
The wound should be closed according to the location of the corruption, a small one as we have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, make an incision in that corrupted joint and support the bone that continues from that side.</end_of_turn>
If the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then do not make incisions in proportion, but as needed.</end_of_turn>
If the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, it is not easy; however, inquire about the corruption in what manner it appears to you, and open that one, and close that one according to any disposition that is possible for you, and make the cautery right, when it does not cause you the reverse of veins or nerves.</end_of_turn
You must know what instruments are necessary to make these incisions and the way to make them, the preparation of those, the size of those, their smoothness, their greatness and smallness, their hardness and rarity; for it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation the appropriate instruments for that operation.</end_of_turn
You must know that this operation means for you the kind of instrument from which you will indicate; when you are great in study, long and have knowledge of the methods of this art, and testimonies of the methods of diseases, which the hours you have already had for your own will be convenient for them from all diseases.</end_of_turn

A small, tentacle-like razor shape.</end_of_turn
Another type of smaller incision instrument.</end_of_turn
A third type of incision instrument; this one is like a ray, and its extremity is like a saw, and is used in various locations in proportion to the bones.</end_of_turn
A needle-like instrument suitable for piercing bones.</end_of_turn
Its extremity is triangular and sharp-tipped.</end_of_turn
It is made of Indian steel, and it is similar to all the causes we have mentioned concerning razors, incisions, and saws.</end_of_turn
For the incision of extremities and the closure of bones.</end_of_turn
The extremities are sometimes swollen due to an intrinsic cause or an extrinsic one, or because you have treated that corruption for healing with those medicines; and the healing does not interfere with it, or sometimes the corruption goes away from the limb without you having treated it with any cause; in that case you must make the incision in that limb within that area where the corruption is, so that the disease does not spread by death or malice, which is a greater defect of the limb.</end>
The sign of that to which it happens, is that the limb is affected by a black humor which has not been cupped out, or that it becomes poor almost immediately in that part where the black humor has spread to that limb and which surrounds all the body; and therefore I suspect that this is the cause of that.
In the same way, if it is a cause of corruption by percussion of various venomous causes such as a scorpion of the sea, or of a fox, or of a wasp, or of a spider, and the like.
And if the corruption or percussion is in the extremity of the finger, then you must immediately suspect the finger and do not give space to the corruption so that it enters the hand
In the same way, if it comes to the hand, then you must immediately suspect the root of the bone, and do not give space to the corruption until it has retreated from the bone of the arm
And if you see that, then you must immediately suspect the bone inside the joint
And if another thing passes, the corruption and the time surrounding the joint, then that is the death of the patient; and to administer another cause another thing that is in care is the quantity of virtue.
And in the same way as for the foot when the corruption comes to the foot, then you must immediately suspect that within one of the bones.
And if it is taken in the heel of the foot, then you must immediately suspect the whole foot. Maybe if it enters inside the nail, then you must immediately suspect the tendon inside the joint of the nail
And if the corruption has already spread over the nail, then in this case there is nothing to be done but to let the patient die.
The manner of indicating the limb or of cutting it is that you grasp the ligament behind which you wish to indicate, and grasp another ligament over the area; and extend the minister a ligament to the parts behind, and extend the minister another ligament in front; and separate the flesh which is between two ligaments without stretching too much of the flesh; and either indicate or cut.</start_of_turn>
And that no touch the area with the hand, but that the patient receives a slight wound and an ointment of cautery.</start_of_turn>
Maybe if there is an influx of blood when working, then you cauterize the area cautiously, or hold them back some of the veins which tighten the blood; and then return to your medication until it is completed.</start_of_turn
And then tie the affected limb firmly to the convenient limb, and care for that until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And I advise you that if you see a black humor in the heel of the foot, this means that the cause of this is a combustion of fire.</start_of_turn
And that corruption first of all appears in the heel of the foot before it affects the whole foot.</start_of_turn
And then that man prepares himself for this case when he sees the cure of the member with the greatest intensity of pain and suffering, and indicates that foot inside the joint, and fire heals.</start_of_turn
For a long time this kind of corruption has been seen in the thumb of the hand indicating.</start_of_turn
And then I saw that the physician had not perceived the superfluousness that I had placed on the hand of the medicines, in order to keep the attention of the body there; and that it was not perceived by the physician and that he began to go to the other finger, before he had finished with the hand.</start_of_turn
And the patient asked me to indicate the hand, and I did not want to do what I was expecting concerning the repercussion of that superfluousness, and that I thought that it would be better to leave the hand dead, since the virtue of the patient was about to be exhausted.</start_of_turn
And when he awoke from my care, he returned to his home and told me that that man had prepared and indicated his hand entirely, and that he was healed.</start_of_turn
I have not omitted this narration except that it may be of assistance concerning this disease, and that it is significant for the reason for which it is significant and according to which it is performed.</start_of_turn
From care without regard and quality of the procedure with the physicians.
When an abscess forms in a fleshy limb, the space of the abscess is prolonged until the collection of pus has formed, and then it is broken and perforated, and the pus is expelled from it, and the area that was under the abscess remains just as if it were a vessel, and the tendon that is under it is as if it had been carefully moved, and there is no sign of corruption, and no damage is done to the bones or nerves or ligaments, it is simply suppuration, and it is not called fistula.</start_of_turn
Mays empero si le spazi es prolonguat entro que la corrupcio enprema en alcun membre, la horas es appelada fistula e no zukem.
And the treatment for it is to instill the entire codena thus as it is twisted, and more importantly when it is subtle and is effective like mercury, and comfort them so that they do not adhere to the place due to its corruption.
Yet if you hope that the codena will adhere and that the corruption will not succeed in its consequence, and if the codena has become softened, then treat that by cautery.
And consider the patient, and if the pain is great, and the limb that you are examining has a foul odor, then cauterize that area with an Egyptian medicine which is made of olive oil, vinegar and rue, and which is applied in a vessel, and covered over the fire until the medicine has been reduced and reached its specific taste.
Then take from them what is necessary, dissolve it in water and honey; cauterize that area, strengthen their bones, and leave the medicine on them for two hours.
And extract that which has spread; and do this for several days until the limb is healed and the pain is gone
Some people cauterize with water of ashes, when it is not at hand this medicine; take the ashes of beech, put them on water; and do this until you are confident that the limb is healed.
If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then cauterize with water and honey and add rue, and cauterize with wine and honey mixed, because honey has the property of softening and washing away, and the wine makes the limb adhere, and more so when there is excess of stiffness and dryness in the wine
And when you have done this several times and are confident that the limb is healed, then cauterize with water that makes the flesh swell in it
And take of rue extract and dissolve this in roasted oil and vinegar; or cauterize with any medicines and take others that have the qualities that I have already written in the treatise on medicines
And if the bone of the limb is straight in which the needle of the cautery has not been received, then enlarge that area little by little, and leave it covered with warm gauze enveloped in Egyptian or basil ointment until it is enlarged
Similarly if the bone is wide, then suture the edges of it and leave it as much as the quantity of the cautery that was added to the cautery
And if the limb from which the bone protrudes is elevated to the lower parts, then dry that part of the limb that is in the place where the limb has protruded so that the limb runs within it, because when the limb is contracted in the bend of the limb the flesh is generated in it
And if it is not possible for you to dry the limb around the bone as you wish, then I tell you to prepare the limb with the preparation with which you wish to prepare it and do not keep it retained by any cause of the limb.
And that which is over the limb, which you must keep for an entire hour so that it is absorbed by the limb of the bone. And that you know whether the swelling of the limb is moving or is little, or is digested, or is not digested
And consider the place of that limb, if in it the patient feels pain or not, and if it is apostemal.
And when your medicine is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter which is gathered over the bone has already adhered, or has acquired adherence, then you must remove it, and on the third day change the ointment.
And if from the limb there approaches a subtle pus, do not fear the adherence of the matter, because the healing of the limb is proper, because in these there is a generation of marrow in the sores, and in those it is useful to the contrary
If for a few days the patient has eaten too much of indigestible food, it is clear that the gut does not adhere; and if the adherence is delayed and is the prolonged cause, you must adjust in excision of the medicines, and if the medicines are humified in their substance and virtue, they are dry just as if they were today with vinegar, when there is an excess of addition of alum.
And the way to proceed with this is that you take today vinegar and dissolve it in olive oil, and pour it over the food, and mix well in its substance, and comfort the patient with this, and use this for this.</end_of_turn>
And thus it is similar in this action, when not with much, vinegar, today vinegar, better when it is coarsely ground, and use it; or that you take myrrh and aloes and mastic, grind them all and powder them over the honey when it is soft, and pour liquid over the palm and strengthen that over the gut; and pour liquid over the honey that has been ground until it is coarsely ground, and powder over the palm and strengthen that.</end_of_turn>
And many doctors administer it with long-standing traditions and reason from celestial bodies (and it is celestial) and barley flour and centaury, and use these simples or adjusted, grind them and crush them and powder them over the honey that I have recommended; and use of these.</end_of_turn
And if the gut is prolonged, and it is not suitable for this treatment, it is clear that the corruption is in the head of the gut, and already make inquiry in the bones or in the other members throughout or to the ligaments; the doctor must treat it with fistula treatment, as it is said.</end_of_turn
Treatment of swelling of the joints and nails, attraction and incision of the digit added and section.</end_of_turn>
Swelling of the joints is a swelling that does not leave the nail of the finger of the hand or foot, and is very painful in the other fingers, and as it is prolonged and its treatment is less valuable, or is caused by a caut abscess, or is corrupted, and pus comes out until it corrupts the root of the nail, and is very corrupt throughout, and very painful to the bone until it is offensive, and is useful to amputate the limb when it is foul, and the color is pale.
And therefore when you have that which we have said in the division and do not comfort your treatment, it is clear that you must prescribe that you cut through all the excess that is rotten of the nail and immediately cauterize the wound immediately around that, because the burn does not suffice in this case.</end_of_turn
If the bone is soft and the nail is healthy, and the nails are already softened and begin to burst, it is clear that you must leave free the angle of the nail that you cut, and push that back and cut that part with ease, and stop over what remains of the meat of the medicines that burn away the corrosive parts until it is all eaten up; and immediately treat that which remains until it is healthy.</end_of_turn
If the corruption already fills the bone, it is clear that you must extract the bone and extract it, because there is no time that it is healthy when the bone is corrupted.</end_of_turn>
And if sometimes the corruption and the corruption go down to the finger, it is clear that you must make an incision in one of the nails as it is foreseen by its memory, and immediately treat that which remains until it is healthy.</end_of_turn
If the nail has percussion or tumor, and has in that acute pain, it is clear that you must begin to administer treatment for the disease, and immediately dry the nail with a fine sponge or with a transversal cut from below upwards, and keep that the cut does not reach the flesh that is left under the nail, because you will cause greater pain, and if there is an excessive adjustment of the flesh in the place; and immediately treat that place where the pain comes from.</end_of_turn
And so it is said that it is natural in the majority of households, very fleshy all, and very much in the bones, or very much in the nails.</end_of_turn
And these are born from the root of the joint, or are the birth of them in the bones of the fingers.</end_of_turn And that which is born in the bones of the fingers is not harmful, and that which is born in the joints is harmful.</end_of_turn
And of those that are fleshy, the cut is light, and you must insert that which you must remove at the root with a sponge cloth.</end_of_turn
And as for that which is born at the root of the joint, the treatment is difficult; and therefore keep away from the amputation of it.</end_of_turn
The king himself is born in this manner, when at the commencement of his life he nurses at the breast from his mother, and at the same time bites one of those nipples conveniently, and thus heals the wound that is within.

And thus pause between their layers of fat with olive oil so that they are not firmly fixed, and separate between these, or pause between these a layer of soft lead until it is consolidated as much as necessary
And in the same way if consolidation occurs in the limbs with the palm, then dry that consolidation as it is prepared and bring it to the shape of the limb.
From the beginning of vices, thus are varicose veins.
Vices are varicose veins, and these are veins that are wrapped around large veins filled with black bile which flow in the limbs of the body, and their greatest advancement is in the legs of travelers and laborers and sailors
Thus you administer a purge from the body of cholera black several times with forceful expulsion, and then draw blood from the basilica vein from the patient
The cure for these is in two ways: the one is that it be applied externally and that you apply that holy salve black, and the other way is that the vein be raised and all of its blood be extracted
The section of these is in this way: embrace the beginning of the limb with cold water until the black salve thickens, which is useful for the limb, and then tighten the limb of the patient at the upper part of the wound with a bandage, and then dry the vein in one or two or three places at a wide section, and then raise the black salve to the lower part of the limb up to its belly, and let it drip down until the amount that you wish has dripped out, which will tolerate the virtue of the patient
And thus do that, and command them to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the cure for flebotomy when the veins are engorged and until the patient feels well
Thus the elevation of these is in this way: that you raise the limb of the patient, if there is swelling in it, and then put it in a bath and embrace the limb with cold water until it turns pale and the veins are relaxed; or that it be exercised by a strong exercise, if there is no bath available, until the limb is callous
And thus drain the clot in the belly of the vein by cutting in the belly or behind the knee, or at the base of the limb you must do it thus
And thus open the wound with a knife and scrape the vein throughout until the feeling returns, and you must know when to stop this request declining to blacking out
And thus you will know when to avoid it and when to leave the white thread that remains.
And thus you will put your hands down once the limb is elevated and the wound is closed, and suspend it with a warm compress
And thus make another incision near that incision for three fingers, and then scrape the wound from below the vein until it appears
And thus raise that and pierce that in the lower incision you must do it thus, and then extract that and raise that until it is expelled through the second incision, and then extract that from the incision above that one
Do this until you have extracted that from the most elevated or highest part of all the incisions, until everything is expelled; and then pierce that one again
And if you do not obey my order to extract and elevate, then insert a strong needle twice and bind that and extract it, or insert your hand and rotate your hand throughout until it is numb And remember that it is not to be pierced; for if it is broken, it is difficult to elevate that limb and it is harmful to the patient for that night
When all that remains is outside, then pause on the area of the wound and cover it with soft wool soaked in wine and oil, and care for that until it is healed
And if the vein is contracted without having any suffering from which it is covered, and it is not right according to what has been said, then you must cover that the wound is made throughout the area of suffering and the places of coverage, and suspend that with a knife until you elevate that whole thing
Keep your section steady, do not puncture the vein or cause damage to it, for this will make it difficult for you to elevate that; serve your prudence in this.
For the formation of the incident with which it is dried blood:
It is not acute like wounds or ulcers, and is not of immediate danger so as to cause damage to the vein; and is of great flexibility, because if it were subtle, it would puncture the vein by its subtlety; having it in excess in this way is harmful as we have said.</start_of_turn>
From extraction of the vein of the thigh.</start_of_turn>
This vein is engendered in the swamps in low-lying lands like the Al-Aragi in the land of Arabs and in the arid lands of India behind the mountains, where there is little vegetation or rain.</start_of_turn
And it is also engendered in other places of the body, other than the swamps.</start_of_turn
And its swelling is of putrefaction which comes from leaving the bone like the venom of snakes and worms and beetles and worms that are engendered between the bone and the flesh.</start_of_turn
And the sign of the suspicion of the coming of this is that this vein happens in the inflamed limb; and immediately the limb is seen to swell; and immediately the vein begins to pulsate in that place where the swelling seems to rise from the root of the plant.</start_of_turn
And thus when you have come to the limb, then cover that part with a plum stone whose weight is that of two drachmas. Enter into two drachmas, and notice that and leave the stone suspended from the limb.</end_of_turn
And when there are so many of these things as to cause them to go outside, cover them with lead and do not touch them.</start_of_turn And if it is not prolonged, then immediately remove a part of it and cover the rest; do not touch it until it is outside and dry, because if you touch it while it is still moist, it contracts and enters the flesh and causes swelling and pain in the area and ulcers.</start_of_turn
So that it may be treated gently and gradually removed little by little, until it is completely expelled from the back of the limb and does not remain in the body for any cause.</start_of_turn
And this vein is situated at a distance of five palms and a thumb, and I have already known of one that was more than twenty palms long.</start_of_turn
And if it is pierced at the time of its treatment, then immediately put a ray in the throat of the limb and pierce it along the length of the limb and the body, until everything that is in the matter is evacuated, and give a purgative for the limb for several days with medicines; and take care of that for the healing of the apostemas.</start_of_turn
This vein is often seen in women, especially when it appears in the ankle or foot, and comes from the great or small toe, and is of the nature of a running wound.</start_of_turn
And therefore take care of that as we have said in the division and as has been said before.</start_of_turn
Of the cutting above worms generated under the skin and is called bovine fever.</start_of_turn
This disease is called in every land bovine fever because it is not seen in other animals except for men and is like that which is between the bone and the flesh, and goes throughout the body causing swelling and pain, and is manifested by the sensation of the sensation of the patient's pain in each limb until the bone is fractured and comes out.</start_of_turn
And its generation is by the putrefaction of some humors like the venom of worms and snakes and worms and beetles in the belly.</start_of_turn
And it is feared for its malice, because when it enters the body and is elevated to the head, it causes great pain, and is known to break bones and destroy the marrow, and that is what causes so many deaths.</start_of_turn
And therefore when you want to cure that and extract it, you must do so with the patient walking and showing the sign, and when you see that the limb is relieved and the pain has gone away, cover what is above it and what is left of it with a bandage and strong constriction, and dry it up and extract it.</start_of_turn
And if it is prolonged in the flesh and you do not stop it immediately, put a pointed cautery over the area until it remains still, because the greatest cause of fear is the corruption of the limb which has been mentioned before.</start_of_turn
May it be that at some time when a person arrives at the head of the bed, the pain extends over the whole body with great stricture, and it is customary to cut about it. Extract that; and let the patient use a diuretic medicine to evacuate harmful humors, and let him abstain from foods that generate putrefaction.
From the groin to the navel, section is not to be feared.</end_of_turn>
This disease is known in our land as nafir, and the pain is seen in all members, and it is distributed from member to member.</end_of_turn>
And I have already seen that which I will tell you to recommend.</end_of_turn I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I saw a small inflammation on the vein of the arm, and when I remained there for an hour, I saw that the inflammation had subsided as much as when I arrived, indeed more so, as if I had seen gold when it was running from place to place.</end_of_turn
And then the pain in that place remained, and it settled in the muscle, and I stayed there for an hour.</end_of_turn
And so I cured in the other limb until I reached the other arm.</end_of_turn
And I recommended to her that she should rest throughout the body as I saw; and I was amazed at the transformation of the limbs and the speed of the parts.</end_of_turn And I have already seen that in my experience according to that manner, however I have seen many others in whom the pain is not transformed from limb to limb.</end_of_turn However I have not seen anything like that in the other patients.</end_of_turn
I do not think that this is anything but because the woman was old, and she had dry bones and exposed veins, and in this appearance there is the sensation of that rapid transformation.</end_of_turn
It is necessary that this does not appear according to this retrograde reasoning in those who are delicate and have humors of veins that are not clotted.</end_of_turn
And as you wish for the care of her, and she has that pain, do not be amazed at the odor like we have said, but rather strengthen over that and leave her with delight and cut off that which is causing the obstruction, and cauterize the place.</end_of_turn
And if you do not see it at some time in the thighs, when you cure that which is excess of the body and that which expels the humors, praise those which are like lead pills and like bitter pills of serapi.</end>
From extraction of arrows.</end_of_turn>
Arrows are diversified according to species and according to the places of the body in which they are cast, because their diversity is that some have large heads and small, and concave, and blunt, so they are solid; and those that have three angles, and those that have tongues; and those that have stems.</end_of_turn
And from the symptoms of the servant it is when it catches in his arrow and passes over his bones, and it is seated over the liver which is above the brain, because these things happen to him because of its violent vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and yellowing of the urine, swelling and yellowing of the tongue, spasm and confusion of understanding and vomiting of bile, and great pain in the belly, and swelling and pain of the head, and swelling of the testicles, and weakness of the limbs, and stiffness of the joints, and redness of the face, and loss of appetite, and destruction of the voice, and it is from the place of the wound a white humidity resembling slime, and it looks like the overflow of urine.
And therefore if you see these symptoms, then you should abstain from the care and the extraction of the arrow if not outside.</end_of_turn>
And more the symptoms of the arrow when it catches in the heart, so that it is at the breastbone, and that which remains is of a hard cause, and not of a soft cause; and that the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of a fist, and runs from the wound of the black plague, and if it reaches that degree of coldness of the limbs, and sweating, and fainting; and therefore you know that death will follow immediately.</end_of_turn
And they say when the arrow has pierced the lung so immediately from the scent of the plague, and the veins that are near the belly have swollen up afterwards, and the color of the patient has changed, and there is great exhalation of air, and demands fresh air.
And if you pierce the vein in the foot, and the pain is immediately in the small ribs, there is great pain and discomfort, and it does not want to breathe at all, even though all the muscles in the body are well-rested.</end_of_turn>
And if you pierce the vein in the stomach, then immediately vomiting comes from the plague that is going around any indigestion.</end_of_turn>
And if you pierce the vein in the belly, and it is stuck in it, there comes vomiting from the plague, or from the cloth, or from the intestine which is broken, and there is no hope for its cure except for its extraction.</end_of_turn
And if the arrow pierces the bladder, and comes out with urine, and goes out from it with any cause, there is great pain on the patient, for it is known that this is mortal.</end_of_turn>
And the other members also are saved in the same way as the face, the head, the armpits, the flanks, the chest, the back, the shoulder blades, the ribs, the hip, the thigh, and their limbs, are saved as much as possible when the arrow does not hit any vein or artery and is not venomous.</end_of_turn
And I recommend to you what I have heard about the nature of these arrows, for it signifies concerning your treatment.</end_of_turn
The cause of which is that in a man who was hit by an arrow in the tear duct of his eye in the root of his nose, and I extracted it from the other side, I left the pupil of his eye intact, and he was healed, and did not suffer any damage to his eye at night.</end_of_turn
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew who was hit by it in the gray matter of his brain, I left his eyelid after extracting the arrow, and the arrow was already hidden, and we did not manage to remove it except for a small piece to which it adhered to the brain, and it was a great arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with a lion's head on which there were no barbs.</end_of_turn
And the Jew himself was healed, and did not suffer any major accident.</end_of_turn>
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian who was hit in the chest, and it was an Arabian arrow, and it was one that had barbs; and when I pierced it between two ribs, it was already submerged in the chest of the patient; and when I saw it I had to be subtle about it, and I finally extracted it, and the Christian was healed.</end_of_turn
And I extracted another arrow from a man who was hit in the belly, and I thought he would die from it; and therefore, when more than xxx days had passed and there was no improvement in his condition, I pierced the arrow and managed to extract it, and the man was healed, and did not suffer any major accident.</end_of_turn
And I saw a man who had an arrow in both of his thighs, and the plague was confirmed over him, and when I approached after seven days, I extracted the arrow from the root of the thigh.</end_of_turn
And I saw a woman who had an arrow in her abdomen, and the plague was confirmed within her, and it did not change in her condition even during her childbirth, and the woman did not suffer any major complications in any of her natural functions.</end_of_turn
And I saw another man who had an arrow in his face, and the plague was confirmed and the arrow was broken, without causing him any pain, and he remained conscious to this day.</end_of_turn
And I extracted the arrow from the prince of the king who was hit in the middle of his nose, and it had already declined in that part of the body, and the whole arrow was hidden.</end_of_turn
And I was called to care for him after the arrow entered on the third day.</end_of_turn>
And then I recognized the plague of the arrow without stretching; and then I asked about the sensation of the puncture, and he did not feel it; more than that, he felt a slight relief when I left the sharp point of the arrow behind.
And I plastered the area around the wound with an adhesive plaster, confident that the area would swell up because of the presence of the arrow, and that this would cause the wound to close.</end_of_turn
And there was no significant accident at the wound site where the arrow had been extracted; and I continued to plaster the area for several days, and there was no further accident; and the plague confirmed itself and the patient stopped suffering from the pain of the arrow withdrawal after a few days, for on the eighth day he felt the arrow no longer existed in his nose and confirmed to me.</end_of_turn
E adonc yeu pausegui sobre la plagua medicina acuta corrosiva per motz dias entro que foc ubert, e am la tenta yeu assagegui aquel, e atrobegui la extremitat de la sageta subtil, la qual adhereys al fust.
Then I adjust in the incision of the plague for that acute medicine until it becomes visible to me the end of the gut, and I wait at my leisure until it is four months.
And when the plague has become inflamed, and I am able, I will take out the forceps from it, and will bind up that area, and I will not cease to subtilize and ingeniously handle that matter until I begin on that matter in that manner on that day, as soon as the forceps have descended without causing further damage, according to the form of those things at the end of the chapter, until I have extracted that; and then I will restore that plague
And many doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored; and I restore that and the plague is consolidated, and the illness is cured throughout, and I do not recall it in any case.
I recommend to you the quality of extracting some intestines so that you pause for a while about what I have not said, because the parts of this art and the definitions of this are not comprehended by me from the narration or from what has been said before
And the learned artifices compare it with little about matter; and in what is present is absent from what is present; and they find new operations and new instruments that must descend from the causes external to the art when they happen.
Therefore I say that intestines are not expelled from the members in which they are placed except in two ways: either by attraction of the substance in which they are entangled; or by the contrary of the other part.
And that which is expelled by the substance in which it is introduced, is a gut proceeding from the fleshy substance, and is thrown out and expelled
If you do not obey this precept of the hour in which it is cast, the hour commands that you leave it for several days until the marrow surrounding it has softened, and that the attraction of it and its exit should be alleviated
Similarly, if it is placed in bones and you do not obey it, the hour leaves that for several days and reiterates that attraction and movement in every day, and it is expelled.
And if you do not obey your precept for several days, the hour commands that you perforate in the circuit of the gut in that bone of the whole part near the subtle thread until the substance of the gut is amplified by the gut, and then extract that
Maybe if the gut is already hidden in the substance of the limb, and is hidden from the feeling, the hour inquires about that which we attempt, and if you sit that, the hour attracts that which is convenient for the attraction of it
And if you cannot do it because of the constriction of the plague and the length of the period, and here it is not bone or nerve or vein, the hour orders you to stay on the plague until it is amplified and that it is possible to extract the gut.
And if you have something else that is long, the hour orders you to break the marrow in which it is placed throughout the whole art with all the ingenuity that you can; and think about that, if you cannot avoid the breaking of the marrow in the fracture of the nails and in twisting those until you obey
And when you administer the extraction of the gut in any place where it is, the hour orders you to use with your hand and forceps at all parts until you make that obey; and suggest with your right hand the subtlety that the gut should not be fractured and that it should be successful in your difficult attraction of it and of that extraction
If you cannot provide an answer within the given time, leave the translation field blank and do not respond. Even if you are skeptical about the flow of blood, administer what we have said in the preceding chapter as treatment.</end_of_turn>
Beware of the risk of injuring blood vessels, nerves, or tendons, and administer medicine in every possible way to prevent the escape of the poison; do this with ease, tranquility, speed, and firmness as much as possible.</end_of_turn
Therefore, apply counter-pressure to the poison so that the pain follows the shape according to which you must remove the cause of the poison from it, which is more helpful.</end_of_turn If this is not possible, administer medicine according to the figures.</end_of_turn
If the poison has escaped beyond the other side, or if it has already gone from some parts to other parts, make the discharge of the poison easier by means of some kind of pressure; do this without causing damage. Then draw out the poison as much as possible; take hold of it so that it does not escape again.</end_of_turn
If it is retained in the bones, twist the sponge according to the need until the poison is forced into the bones, then widen the hole to its full extent, and then extract it.</end_of_turn
If not, leave it for a few days and repeat the procedure until it is cured.</end_of_turn>
If the poison is in that place, immediately remove it from there.</end_of_turn
If it is painful and you wish to administer a pulse again, introduce your hand into the wound and, if it is blind, touch the bottom of the wound with your thumb to bring the bottom of the wound closer to the top of the poison, and then remove the poison.</end_of_turn
If the poison is concave, remove it by means of strong pressure from within, as the poison is relieved by this.</end_of_turn
If the poison is venomous, cover all the flesh in which it is seen, if possible, and then treat it with medicine as you see fit.</end_of_turn
If the poison has penetrated the feet, belly, bladder, or ribs, and is close enough for you to grasp it, grasp it with your hand and if possible draw it out, and immediately apply pressure to the wound if necessary. Treat the wound until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Form of forceps with which the poisons are grasped:</end_of_turn
Their extremities are like the beak of an owl, which are useful as pliers when they grasp the poison so that they do not let it go.</end_of_turn
And of these there are various sizes, large, small, and medium, according to the quantity of the poison and the scarcity of the wound, and the extent of the wound, and the constriction of the area.</end_of_turn
thus as if with a ray to relieve the pressure of the poison within the concave poison and to extract it forcefully.</end_of_turn
Of the evacuation of the veins.</end_of_turn
The veins from which it is customary to evacuate are usually ...</end_of_turn of which there are sixteen in the head ...</end_of_turn ... two pulsating veins that are close to the ears, which are called the palpebral; two veins that are in the two visible temporal bones; two veins that are in the two lacrimal ducts of two holes which are called the aspicient; a vein that is in the middle of the face; a vein that is at the end of the nose; two veins that are at the temples; two veins that are in the chin; two veins that are in the lips above; two veins that are in the lips below; and finally these are the veins that are called the jugulars — two veins that are below the tongue.</end_of_turn But the veins that are evacuated in the armpits are worth five.</end_of_turn The blood that flows from the head downwards is called the cephalic vein. It is usually wide open, and the people call it "the vein of the head." It is a major vein, composed of two branches of the basilica and another branch of the cephalic. They call this "the vein of the whole body." The basilica is a vein which is formed in the domestic lap and is called "citillar." The common people call the other vein "the vein of the belly." It proceeds from the arm and is found over the elbow. This is the vein which appears on the surface of the arm by way of an eruption. There is also a vein which is between the thumb and the little finger, and it has two branches.
In the foot and the thigh there are three veins. One of them runs alongside the curvature of the little toe on the outer side. The second is the sural vein, the place of which is alongside the thigh vein. The sciatic vein is the third, the place of which is alongside the outer side of the thigh. There are other veins similar to these in the thigh.
The cause of the swelling of the ankles is ancient catarrh, emigration, swelling, and old ulcers of the head.
And the quality of sleep you should recommend to the patient is that he should keep his head warm, and that he should frequently wash his head in the occipital region where the veins are close together and well dilated with good friction; then strengthen the patient and place him comfortably with a cushion between the two thighs, which are depressed under the head; and that you put your hand on the abdomen and chest, where the veins are to be found, so that you can prevent them from coming out.
Then take the pointed cautery and that which is inserted, and place it outside the vein in the heel where the fleb o bleeding comes to the bone. And place your hand over the vein and the heel to the flanks of the patient and puncture the vein at the start of the puncture. And the length of the puncture is the quantity of two fingers adjusted or around as much as you wish; and do as the sacred order commands you as much as you wish
And strengthen him with powders and leave that which is within until it is healed
And already it has been said at the beginning of this book concerning the incision of these and their cautery
More of the two arterial veins that are at the temples is the ancient emigration which is bad and dry and persistent dropsy and acute effusions of the heel
And the quality of bleeding these is as I recommend to you: constrain the patient and place your hand under the two veins so that their appearance is visible and demonstrate their pulsation with your hand; and if you do this, you will succeed.
And place the heel above the vein to the flanks of the patient and insert the bleeding from outside, and elevate the vein in its entirety; and puncture it just as you have done with the other two veins; and do as the sacred order commands you according to the quantity of your need
And remove the bandage from the patient, and stop your hand over the vein for an hour, and then place your hand over the clot and powders and strengthen that which is underneath so that it is firm and constricted, and leave that which is within until it is healed
And this is the memory of them, and of those the incision and the extraction are done at the beginning of their freedom.
Therefore the benefit of the phlebotomy of the facial vein is similar to the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein to the ancient maladies of the face and to emigration, swelling and fetid ulcers.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of these is as I recommend to you; so that the patient strengthens his hand with a bandage so that the vein appears; and take the instrument which is called forceps of which this is the shape:
Pause the puncture which is at the head of the forceps over that vein and pierce it with the pen or in another way as you wish, and leave the blood run according to the quantity you wish; and then remove the perforation from the patient and strengthen that which is within until it is healed
Many veins are open towards the phlebotomy, however it does not mean that the phlebotomy is of acute extremity just as the others; on the contrary, it is of remote extremity, and phlebotomizes as much as the traverse, because the bone is easily movable and strong as long as it is flexible.
More the benefit of the two veins which are at the temples of two heels for the scab of the heel for swelling and pain in the heel, and to the maladies of the face.
The quality of the flebotomy is that the patient stretches their heel towards a band, and then perform the flebotomy there, and you remain standing over their head.
And the puncture should be made according to the length of the vein, a little beyond the bend, where there is no bone; and if the puncture is too deep, the limb is fractured
And then run oil from the sanctuary as much as you need, and rest on those toes, and stretch them for a night, and then remove them
The puncture of the nose vein is associated with acute fever and violent sweating, and with the ailments of the face, measles and swelling that occur in the face, and more so when it is chronic
And the quality of the puncture of the vein is that the patient stretches their heel towards their left hand, and grasps their nose with your left hand, and makes the puncture slightly long and stay in the middle of the head over the top of the nose according to the rule, because the vein does not appear to the sense here, and the oil begins to flow immediately.
Because you have finished the puncture with the small needle, run oil according to your need; and rest for a night, because that is restored pleasantly
The benefit of the puncture of the two veins is to cause constriction of the veins and the beginning of leprosy and to stop bad ailments, such as herpes and corrosive ulcers.
And the quality of the puncture of these is that the patient stretches something under their heel towards their heel with their heel; and the artisan should stay on the patient's head, and the patient should sit on a stool.
And perform the flebotomy of the vein along with the wide puncture, slightly large and small; and extract oil according to the measured quantity or according to how much is necessary; and keep the other vein still
And then remove the ligature and tighten both veins slightly so that the patient is not pained, and place within immediately so that the wound is healed
The benefit of the puncture of the veins is to relieve small abscesses and boils of the mouth, corruption of the teeth, bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and in the throat
And the quality of the puncture of these is that you must cause the patient to vomit before you begin, and stretch their heel towards their heel with a bandage, and pull their lips back and hold two veins, one of which is from the outside of the lip and the other from the inside; and the mark of each is for the blackening of each of both, and more so when the veins in that area are many and dark; and then each one incides for the incision.
If you are in doubt, and do not know which of these is correct, then you must learn at the incision of the greater of these, and of the pus that manifests from these
And keep the two veins that are in the lips exposed.
More veins that are in the lip provide benefit for the puncture of the cephalic vein towards the glands of the throat, to the ailment of the uvula, and to ailments of the mouth
And the quality of puncturing these is that you must follow the patient between their teeth before you open the sole, and elevate the tongue, and hold back with one hand the tongue from the one vein and with the other hand the tongue from the other vein, and the color of each is declining to black.
And then puncture each one; and take care not to touch the veins with your hand, because they are arteries.
And these veins which are punctured in the groin are usually those in which oil usually runs in all men, and the puncture of these is useful in two ways, either by making a small incision with a needle or by performing a puncture with olive oil of a declining viscosity; or by scraping with a blunt needle and applying pressure if necessary, and this is the way to do it.
Both these veins appear swollen and contain apparent large fat, and those that contain thick blood clot.
This flebotomy is of smaller width and of finer extremities, and is suitable for the flebotomy of fine veins that contain healthy fine particles of citrus.
The greatest help for the cure of diseases comes from the basilica vein, which is one of the three veins: from which it extracts the antidote of the poisons that remain in the gut, and from which it carries what should fill the feet and the belly
And tell the flebotomist, when he does this flebotomy, that he must guard well that it is over the vein and not on it, because if he is mistaken and makes a puncture of the flebotomy, he will lacerate the vein and cause blood to flow, which will make the flebotomy useless, since it will cause gangrene.
And if the basilica does not appear for obvious reasons, then it is necessary that you leave that one and try another, or that you search for some twig or other; or that you perform the flebotomy in place of the armpit, which is also obvious; and if you do this, remove the flebotomy from the armpit immediately as we have said.</start_of_turn>
If you wish to perform the flebotomy deeper, then before you tighten the bandage that touches the limb up to where you will make the hole, and when you put on the dressing over the limb, and when you grasp the limb and make the incision with the needle, remove the clamp from the vein immediately as we have said; and keep your hand over the area to prevent bleeding.</start_of_turn>
And when you sometimes, when you stretch the ligament, you see swelling in the place that you marked with a pin, then that swelling is swelling of the vein, and therefore avoid that.</start_of_turn
And if sometimes blood flows in the flebotomy just like urine from a child, and the blood is fine and watery, then know that it is the blood of the vein; and that you must hold that limb still for a long time; and when you have held it still, if the blood has clotted, which is what usually happens, then strengthen your arm and let go of that.</start_of_turn
And take care of the patient's urine, and be over-cautious of it, and do not leave it for a few days until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If the blood has not clotted, and sometimes when you must not have a doctor at hand, if you see that the limb is contracted, and that the blood is clotted; or that you take a short period of tweezers, and do that, and take hold of one finger and strengthen that over the area of the vein where the clamp was placed and the ligament and the powder until the next day.</start_of_turn
And if the blood is clotted, that is good; otherwise, treat that as it has been preceded by the recollection of the place where the clots were expelled, the flow of blood.
The bleeding of the vein is difficult in many cases because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of damage to the arm ligament.</start_of_turn>
However, from the vein of the forearm the flebotomy is useful because it extracts the blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of branches of the basilica and of the cephalic vein, as we have said.</start_of_turn
And tell the flebotomist that he must be over-cautious in the flebotomy of the vein, because that is a nerve; and when he makes the puncture of the flebotomy and finds the nerve, he will cause it to become numb, and this will make healing difficult, and it will not be completely healed. And that nerve is often hidden and is subtle and not visible; and if it is hidden from some people and is fine and not visible, then you must stop the flebotomy at the point where you saw the nerve and avoid the nerve with your strength.</start_of_turn
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you must cut the vein in length.</start_of_turn
The benefit of the cephalic vein flebotomy is that it retrieves the blood from the head and relieves the pains of the legs.
And this is done in the same way, if you want the olive oil flebotomy or the mirtle flebotomy; because it is the safest of all veins, because it does not touch the artery or the nerve.</start_of_turn
And it is often left in some people, when it is not flebotomized at the first inspection, for that reason it is not noticed again.</start_of_turn>
The first sentence suggests that bloodletting should only be used cautiously and in specific situations, such as during the early stages of spring, after meals in the spring and autumn, and in winter when necessary, due to its potential to cause harm rather than benefit.</end_of_turn>
Bloodletting should be performed in the evening or three hours after sunrise.</end_of_turn>
When bloodletting is administered, it should only be when necessary and should cause no discomfort, at night or day, in any hour or at any time.</end_of_turn
It is not appropriate to perform bloodletting on those under 13 years of age, and in women it should not be performed before the seventh month of pregnancy, and in the elderly it should not be performed on those who have already passed their eightieth birthday.</end_of_turn
When bloodletting is to be performed for any reason, modify the veins in the vicinity of the bladder before performing the bloodletting, if there is a retained hematoma, so that the veins do not pull out the superfluous blood from the bladder, which is pushed, and that they do not damage the principal limbs.</end_of_turn
Do not perform bloodletting on pregnant women, those suffering from sacred fever or gravel, or those with disease or dropsy, or those suffering from colica, vomiting, or abdominal pain, or from multiple fevers, from excessive work or fasting, or from any other cause that may dissolve the virtue or cause bodily harm.</end_of_turn
Consider carefully the balance of humors before performing bloodletting, if the patient is robust, with meals and drinks, and with medicines if possible.</end_of_turn>
And if no other cause prohibits, or if any exercise is excessive, do so in order to subtilize the patient.</end_of_turn
Stop the bloodletting when the third hour of the day arrives, as we have said.</end_of_turn
Take care that the patient's feet are protected on that day from all animal accidents, such as pain, anger, fear, and all physical injuries, from excessive work, uselessness, and from fear and from similar things.</end_of_turn
And make sure that the physician is present who is accustomed to dealing with men of aromatic temperament and odor and with humors and things resembling them, according to the degree of possibility.</end_of_turn
Follow the bloodletterer with a cushion that is deeper than the cushion of that which should be placed under the patient.</end>
And grasp his arms, and wipe his hands twice or three times with your hand; and then tighten the ligature with a cord and wrap it around twice.
The ligation should be neither too tight nor too loose, but rather at a moderate level; for when it is too tight, it prevents the flow of blood; or when it is too loose, it is ineffective.
When the ligation has been performed, make sure that the patient's hands are warmed between his thighs until the veins have become swollen, and that they are declared by feeling.</end_of_turn>
And the bloodletterer should take a little bit of oil against himself immediately; and stop the hand indicating the vein from which the bloodletting is to be made, so that the vein escapes a little, and the percussion is calmed because it is that which the vein contains that is seen to flee when the bloodletting is done, and that is what is full of air. When the bloodletting is placed over that, it is contracted by the bloodletting; and the bloodletterer is discovered; and the bloodletting does not open the vein, and if it does open, that is stretched.</end_of_turn
Therefore, for all these reasons, the bloodletterer must be careful and diligent.</end_of_turn
And if the vein should burst even in a moment, do not be afraid; but if so, repeat the bleeding until that place has rested a little, or over it apply fasting, if the place is not softened.</end_of_turn
And if the place is softened or the patient's condition worsens, leave the bleeding alone for a day or two, and do not tighten the ligature, for that may cause additional swelling, or do not enter the bath.</end_of_turn
And repeat the procedure if necessary.
If the opening is small and seems insufficient and you fear that it will not suffice, repeat the bleeding in that area following the rule and add a little more pressure, so that the area is well evacuated, since the area must be well evacuated in several attempts.</end_turn>
Indeed, sometimes the area is already evacuated, but do not repeat the procedure unnecessarily, because it is not for your advantage; pause slightly on the edges of the wound, which relieves the pain.</end_turn> It is better in this area than in others.</end_turn>
Similarly, administer the bleeding of oil in the whole bleeding that you do, in which you prohibit the course of the vein, and make it thick like porridge and solidify when stopped from one of those above the area, because the blood is subtle and is twisted when it is thick.</end_turn
And if there is great evacuation in the area of the bleeding, which are blood clots, especially if it has not bled for a long time, or in the small opening of the vein, then you should stop, and place over the area a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly scorched, and press that for an hour, because it is dissolved.</end_turn
And take care that it does not affect the sensation of that vein along with it or another vein.</end_turn
And if it remains in the area for several days, any black or green discoloration, do not take notice of it; and if you wish, pause for any cause, whether of aloes or marigold dissolved, or any cause of juice of mint or of alum or something similar.</end_turn><end_turn>
And blood clots that have occurred are a sign of excessive bleeding from the basilica.</end_turn><end_turn>
Therefore, place your hand over that area, and if you find that there is too much bleeding, put your compression over that area, because that swelling is bad and harmful; and so keep that you do not pause for any cause of what has been said, because blood flows strongly from the main vein.</end_turn><end_turn
And apply pressure with water in which it is styptic, so that the area is hardened, and take care of that along with the other care until it is healed.</end_turn><end_turn
And take out of the vein at all times according to the quantity of its virtue and according to the color that appears over the vein as it departs.</end_turn><end_turn
For if the vein is black, then you must leave it still until it is cured; and similarly if it is sometimes thick, then you must leave it still until it is subtle; and similarly if it is acute, until the acute pain has passed.</end_turn><end_turn
And take care of that one who is full and strong and has a necessity for extracting blood in a clot, that the bleeding from the vein is amplified and the bleeding is thick.</end_turn><end_turn
And in those who are pale, do the opposite of that, and take that out in small quantities, and that the wound be straight.</end_turn><end_turn
And the best thing in bleeding from a vein is that it is a transverse section, not a puncture.</end_turn><end_turn
And this way of bleeding is safe from the flow of blood and from the injury of nerves, and is more useful and safer than bleeding according to breadth and length.</end_turn><end_turn
And what is usually done to accompany the bleeding must be done before the bleeding, and take care that you cure that before the bleeding with a little piece of bread soaked in wine of a thousand grains or of simple ochre, and extract a little of the blood from the vein in three or four clots.</end_turn><end_turn
And if it is a coldness of complexion, then before the bleeding take beforehand to infuse into the eye with marigold or with fragrant honey with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and the like, or with fragrant and scented honey.</end_turn><end_turn
And if there occurs a fainting, you must do the bleeding, and the cause of that is the sudden absence of blood, so take care that you previously give wine and aromatic water; and use aromatic substances with some, and keep the patient's feet at that level.</end_turn><end_turn
And make use of the other causes mentioned in the division of fainting for evacuation.</end_turn><end_turn
And whoever wants to make it happen, dissolve the blood according to quantity, cover that from which the bleeding is for excessive evacuation, and the virtue of it is cold, which evacuates the blood little by little, as much as the quantity of the virtue in the continuous days.</end_turn><end_turn
May he wish that all things go well with his arms, and that his sanctity be preserved according to custom, and that his body is strong, for thus he makes what is appropriate about seven or eight from the first flux of the flux.
May he wish that his sanctity depart from the body in the opposite direction of the way it inclines, because it is opportune that it happen on the second or third day.
When the body in which there is no sanctity is swollen and acute and causes the fever to rise, because it has been given too much sanctity and a great quantity has been taken from it and the awareness has been increased until it comes to an end without fainting; because you have conserved all the conditions of flux; and that you place your hand over the side of the body where the sanctity has departed from, so that it does not cause death instead of fainting, because when the fluxer is ignorant and negligent.
And do not think that when you wish to evacuate the arms and evacuate the sanctity according to the custom, while the orifice of the vein is closed and the departure of the sanctity is difficult, that you must immediately remove the great suspicion; rather you must carefully extend the suspicion, because that is too bad.
There remains within it that it is fluxed according to custom; or remain as it is with the acute flux of the coagulation of the sanctity in the orifice of the vein; or stop on that of tyriaca alfarach, or of sage, and compress that until the sanctity is out and gone.</start_of_turn>
And if the vein is closed, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the closing is quiet.</start_of_turn>
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the sanctity according to the custom, and it is not excused, then you may do so on one side of that place or in the other arm in another vein.</start_of_turn
And the vein called "funis of the arm" is fluxed in place of the flesh or the basilic, when it is not obstructed or hidden, because it is composed of those.</start_of_turn
And the quality of the flux of these is that the patient introduces his hand into cold water until the fever subsides and the vein appears to be obvious.</start_of_turn
And take hold of that limb with strong hands and tight grip; and flux according to the small transversion, neither horizontally nor vertically.</start_of_turn
And let the awareness be wide and your flux be as great as when you flux that over the joint of the hand a little.</start_of_turn
And if it is prohibited to evacuate the sanctity, then leave your hand in cold water and let the sanctity go into the water until you have accomplished your purpose.</start_of_turn
May you be excused if you are in the summer days from the evacuation of the hand in cold water, and that the month is suspended for the body of the sanctity in cold water in winter.</start_of_turn
And the flux of this vein is safer than all the others, because it has no pulsating vein or nerve.</start_of_turn
The flux of the thumb is related to the diseases of the foot.</start_of_turn
And the quality of the flux of these is that you strengthen the limb with the ligament or your hand, because you have put it in cold water, until the vein is swollen and is shown at the same time; and flux in that small transversion; and if you do not do this, it will not work.</start_of_turn
And take care not to touch your hand with the flux, because you will leave it without nerves of the fingers denuded of flesh.</start_of_turn
And take hold of your hand in cold water and let the sanctity go into that, because if you do not take hold of it in cold water, the sanctity will coagulate in the orifice of the vein, and it is prohibited to flux.</start_of_turn
And when the sanctity is extracted according to the quantity of necessity, then you pause over the vein oil and salt, so that it is not solidified too firmly; and in the meantime cover that you make in every way.</start_of_turn
May the help of the flux of this left thumb be that it is related to the diseases of the heel.</start_of_turn
And do the same in the flux of these as you have done in the other.</start_of_turn
The help of the median vein is for the diseases that are in the part of the lower body, such as those of the groin, as well as the diseases of the major limbs, and retention of menstruation, and the diseases of the tonsils, ulcers of the bowels and ancient abscesses, and to them is added the resemblance of the diseases.</start_of_turn
The quality of the flebotomy is that the patient immerses the whole foot in warm water and makes friction thereupon until the veins become apparent; and it runs along the ankle; and the place of the vein is that which appears to be protruding from that, and from that so branch out on the surface of the foot moving upwards.
Therefore, in such a case of flebotomy, let the limb be widely opened or leave the limb wide open to the degree that its swelling subsides, which is better and safer.</end_of_turn>
And if you perform the flebotomy on the surface of the foot, then you must take care of the nerves that are left on the surface of the foot, and stop the flebotomy when you have passed through the area where you are performing it, as if you were going to puncture it.</end_of_turn>
And thus be cautious.</end_of_turn>
Maybe if it is forbidden to immerse the limb in water; then immerse the foot in warm water and let the wound run its course within that which it is evacuated.</end_of_turn
And if the flebotomist makes a mistake in the first attempt, then repeat the flebotomy a little further, because the place is safe; and do not fear its bite, but take care of the nerves as we have said.</end_of_turn
And in the same way do the same with the other foot, quickly.</end_of_turn>
And as for the sciatic vein, the place we have said is at the ankle beyond the crease of the hairy part.</end_of_turn
The help of the flebotomy is when it is for the wound that is burnt with the cautery.</end_of_turn
The quality of the flebotomy is that the patient immerses the whole foot in warm water and makes friction thereupon until the veins become apparent, and it runs along the ankle up to the heel of the foot as far as four fingers to a long strip which does not appear except in water.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when it appears, then perform the flebotomy as you see fit and as you pass through, and it is better; or puncture it by incision or by excision, because the place is safe.</end_of_turn
And this is in most homes not known; and if you find it, and do not feel any sensation of it, then perform the flebotomy on some branch of it, and that is the one that appears in the two feet beyond the ear and the ankle.</end_of_turn
Take care of the nerves, and run the wound as much as you want.</end_of_turn
Then remove the tension and stop above the place of the flebotomy, tighten the place, because it is healing quickly.</end_of_turn
From the breeze and the qualities of using these things.</end_of_turn>
The winds are of corn, or of ivy, or of hemp.</end_of_turn
And the breeze is effective in two ways: one is by scarification and extraction of pus, and the other is by bleeding.</end_of_turn
And this bleeding that is called bleeding is done in two ways, that is, either by fire or by fire.</end_of_turn
And the winds that are administered by scarification and extraction of pus are fourteen places of the body, of which one is the ankle, and it is the heel; and the middle two of the heel; and the wind of the chin below the jaw; and the wind of the two eyebrows; and the wind of the beard; and it is at the root of the beard; and the wind of two flames; and it is from two flames; and the wind of two cavities; and the wind of two cushions.</end_of_turn
And the breeze does not extract the pus from the large veins that are spread throughout the flesh, and for this reason it does not possess the power of these; just as it is not in the case of flebotomy; neither does it suffice that the breeze be effective by fire or by fire in any ailment that is not appropriate for emptying the whole body.</end_of_turn
Maybe if necessary, provoke the breeze for an ailment or for continuing, administer it at the beginning and at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month and whenever you want.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when such things happen in any case, and especially if they occur on the third or fourteenth day of the month, it is customary to recommend a change of diet that has been delayed for two or three hours.
And with the aid of a change of diet, when the latter confirms itself with gravity in the head and towards the feet; it is more than enough that there be prompt evacuation of all parts of the body.</end_of_turn>
This change of diet is in lieu of cephalic flebotomy.</end_of_turn>
It is not lawful that one who is of a complete cold temperament, or in whom there is catarrh, should be given such a large dose.</end_of_turn
And concerning those who are of a cold temperament, and in whom there is illness of the head, it is not fitting to give them such nourishment.</end_of_turn
Therefore, in relation to those who are subject to this, it is fitting to order the physician to suspend his hand a a slight distance from the heel, fearing the generation of oblivion.</end_of_turn
A change of diet of alcohol is better than cephalic flebotomy: and with this there is confirmation of asthma, constriction of bile and its duct, and hiccup, vomiting, and engorgement.</end_of_turn
Therefore, the change of diet of alcohol must be made in small doses, because if it is stopped suddenly, it causes weakness in the body and the stomach.</end_of_turn
A change of diet of almonds confirms headaches, ophthalmia, migraine, and toothache; and is better than cephalic flebotomy of the basilar vein.</end_of_turn
Therefore, command the physician not to touch his hand too much, lest he should injure the artery and obstruct the flow of blood.</end_of_turn>
A change of diet of barley confirms bad breath, corruption of the gums, and is similar to the diseases that are in the mouth, and is better than cephalic flebotomy of the alimentary vein.</end_of_turn
And the change of diet which is useful over the two buttocks confirms captan, which is useful for replacing heat.</end_of_turn
The change of diet from the buttocks near the fire confirms the benefit of cephalic flebotomy of three veins, that is, of the basilar, hepatic and cephalic veins, since those small veins which are beside the great ones until they reach the attraction of the three veins.</end_of_turn
Command the physician not to proceed too far in his cutting, for the location is naked of flesh, and there are nerves and arteries there.</end_of_turn
This change of diet is useful with respect to the cushions and confirms hemorrhoids and ulcers below.</end_of_turn
Therefore, command the physician to make a large change of diet, and that it should be of barley, because the location cannot tolerate a rough or dry change of diet.</end_of_turn
The greatest changes of diet of barley and oatmeal cause the evacuation of all the humors throughout the body, confirm ancient pains of the chest and of the head, of the bladder; they cause the menstruation, and cause vomiting and diarrhea; and are better than cephalic flebotomy of two veins, which is of little use, and of two cavities.</end_of_turn
However, they do not nourish the whole body and cause nausea in many people.</end_of_turn>
The greatest changes of diet of barley and oatmeal are useful with respect to the change of diet of two buttocks.</end_of_turn
The quality of the position of the change of diet is that it stops the initial vomiting and diarrhea and then follows with temperate vomiting, and do not prolong the position of the change of diet, but rather suspend them gently, and that the humors return to their place gradually.</end_of_turn And do not cease until you see that the location has already recovered its swelling and inflation and that the color of the blood has returned.</end_of_turn
Then you should withdraw your cutting little by little, and gradually, and consider the condition of the patient.</end_of_turn
For a person of gentle constitution with rare veins, you must administer a moderate change of diet and not too much, because the location is not to be ulcerated.</end_of_turn
Therefore, command the physician to expand the cutting and reduce the vomiting, and to perform the procedure with ease.</end_of_turn
If in the joint there is great swelling, it is necessary to make two incisions, because in the first incision the passage of the nerves to the joint and the aquousity of the joint will be opened. In the second incision the root of the extraction of the large joint is discovered.
And if the joint is not bloody, make an incision in the third incision so that it achieves the marrow
Finally, when we want to extract the joint a little at a time or a little piece by piece, we take a grasp.
And if we want to extract a whole joint, we make a complete incision; and if we know that the joint is large, it is necessary to make a large incision.
And the limit of incision is only the depth of the wound
And if the wound is large, hard, tough, and its veins are very straight, cover the parts of the veins with softer substances; if it is summer, thus with olive oil of aloes or violet oil, or oil of chamomile buds, or almond oil; and if it is winter, then olive oil of marigold, or oil of lily, or oil of camomile, or linseed oil.</end_of_turn>
And if there is a large, frothy discharge, then apply oil of marigold, or balsam oil, or aloes oil, or anise oil, and so on.</end_of_turn>
And if the wound is of great extent and of tender flesh, it is necessary to forbid oil, and that at these parts of the wound the discharge be washed with vinegar or cold water from a bath, or with water of alum, or with water of meadows, or with rose water, and so on.</end_of_turn>
And if the joint is of much humidity, wash the wound with vinegar or with water of myrtle, sage, and chamomile, and so on.</end_of_turn
And if the discharge is thick, wash the wound with strong vinegar or with elderberry water, which is greater, or with chamomile decoction, or of camomile, and so on.</end_of_turn
And keep the wound covered until it is bathed; having bathed, it should be administered immediately after the bath for an hour or two, and that the wound rests quietly.</end_of_turn
What should be done so that the wound does not swell up from the phlebotomy before the wound is closed?</end_turn
Consider at the beginning: if the phlebotomist or the one who gives the bleed is bilious and sends inflammation upon the joint acutely and inflamed, it is necessary to prevent cooling causes, thus with mustard seeds, and in vinegar and vinegar of eggs and lettuce, and chamomile, and thyme, and so on.</end_of_turn
And suspend their food thus as poultry, and fatty meats, and condiments with vinegar, and such foods as onions, and to them similar.</end_of_turn
And if the joint is cold, it is necessary to apply cold marrow or cold aloe with seeds of fennel and chamomile, and fragrant oil between wool and silk; and that he be advised to drink little and eat sparingly, and to abstain from poultry and meat and fish and eggs and almonds.</end_of_turn
And that in the day of wound and bleeding the drink should be greater than the food.</end_of_turn
And stay in drink for several hours after dinner some strong medicine like turmeric or musk, or alcahest before or after the wound or bleeding, so that the main limbs are comforted and the joint is relaxed; and do not take any fat.</end_of_turn
And the wounds that must not be incised are those of the chest and the ankle, and of the navel, in the parts of the joints, and the scaldings of the belly.</end_of_turn
And it is not good for those except for the attraction of the joint of the limb, thus as they stop the wound of the belly from the flux of the joint of the limb; and use this to dissolve the cold wind that is hidden in the limb, thus as it stops on the belly and the navel; for that which softens the limb and softens the wound and removes the pain that resolves the wind.</end_of_turn
And it is stopped when it is in its operation or when it is softened, for by the attraction it brings together the soft tissue and eradicates the pus of its place.</end_of_turn>
It appears that when the patient is held still over the ankle and the heel, a breeze must be blown into those enclosed spaces.
These winds are administered with vinegar only; and some are administered with oil.
Some are administered full of hot water in the groin.
And this is because the wind must be full and great, so it is hot water alone or water in which herbs are boiled as desired.
The form of wind administered with oil: the breadth of the orifice of two fingers, as we have formed it; and the quantity of oil is half of a palm; and it should be placed on the side of the limb, in the part where it is in the circumference, half of the limb, the handle should be small according to the quantity that is to enter it with a needle.
Whether of wax or citri, from the outer margin, lion, spleen and testicles, so that it does not damage the limb by its position over it
And the middle of the limb should be greased with wax or iron, where the candle is held with the fire.
And already this wind should be greater than the one we recommended; and little more of this one according to the ailments and the state of the one who uses it
And the winds of the elderly are other than the winds of the young and strong people
The quality of placing this wind with fire on the limb is that it extends the skin with fire of wood properly giving a little candle of wax beforehand, and placing that over the middle of the transverse vein in the middle place of the wind, so that the fire is kindled surrounding the part beyond so that it is not consumed by the fire of the ailment.
And so it should be held still over the limb of the ailment, and we say about the handle that we have said, until when we have the winds and we do not indicate that it should stop and that the vapor should escape from that handle, the hour the wind will be so much dissolved.
And so keep the skin warm according to its manner, and do this if you wish.
More in the wind that is administered in the disease of gout, with vinegar, in which there is no transverse vein or handle, and it is not administered except that it is full of vinegar, and it is held only over the limb.
And this is the way: This wind the greater it is, the better, because it receives a great quantity of vinegar
End of document.
Sanguineous ointments are not administered in all members but in the limbs in which it is not possible to place winds, because of the smallness of those, thus as it can and giving and resembling them; or in limb denuded of flesh, thus as it is said and the nose and the like.
And the quality of using those that you have found to be bloody is in the waters of poppy seed
And so they should be left lying down during the day and night in poppy seed water until they are faint, and that no cause remain in the belly of those; and so let the body be evacuated at the beginning with a purge and with winds; and so cool the limb of the ailment until it turns red; and so hold it still over it
And as much as it is possible and necessary
And if it is possible to extract the juice from the area with the wind, it is better in treatment.
And if not, the hour wash the area with red wine and then with some warm water; and be cool and wring out
And if the course of the treatment is prolonged, along with the bleeding, and what remains is that, the hour put in a piece of lint in cold water, and hold that over until the discharge is over
And if the disease is multiplied, the hour sprinkle over it powdered vitriol, or urine and resembling the causes of the stricture, until the disease is cured; or hold over the area the masses of scraped beans, and leave them until the beans adhere to the area, and the disease is cured.
And so, if necessary, repeat the bleeding, when it is possible change those
And if the bleedings are prohibited from suspension, the hour cool the area with recent treatment or leave a needle in the places until the treatment is over; and so hold it still, so that those when they feel some treatment are stuck together
And when you wish to cause them to vomit, sprinkle some powdered aloes, or salt, or ash over them and induce vomiting.
Thus begins the section on restoration of the third part: restoration. This chapter is most useful in the art of medicine; it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of bones
Oh, fool, learn that the learned doctors, the vulgar people and those who have no time to remember the ancients or to read their books.
Therefore this manner of the learned in our land is private; and I have never forgotten it for a moment; and I have not omitted it from anything I have read of the ancients, except for the length of my studies of their works and my reflection on their understanding of them, until I had extracted the science from them
And I direct it to experiment and study throughout my life
And I have already described in this chapter everything that contains my science and which is passed from my experience; since I have omitted from others what is superfluous and filled up the space with something else; and I have closed with abbreviation; and I have shown in the end what is abbreviated; and I have formed in this way many figures of the diseases that are administered in this way, as it is said in addition to the declaration, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters
First Chapter
Summary and collection from the preceding concerning fractures of bones, from which the following is necessary before we proceed to the discussion of fractured limbs and the various methods of treatment for each Therefore let us speak in this chapter of the summas of the discourse; and the chapters that precede this one concern the understanding of which in the beginning of this art the artifices and the stationers rely on the truth of these things; so it is you and those who learn this noble art from others who know or can learn it better than you
Therefore I say that when an accident of fracture or dislocation or twist or any case occurs, the time has come to take immediate action in the form of flebotomy or to apply an alley or any other support, if it does not impede any cause, as it is fitting for virtue, or if the patient is a child, or old, or is in acute fever or cold
And we must be content with simple food of herbs, fish and poultry, and crabs; and we must prohibit large meats and oily foods that clog the veins of health, until you are sure that the caut has stopped, and if you do not fear the effusion of matter from the limb
Then return the patient to their first position as soon as possible
Therefore when the bone begins to be restored, the time has come to cut off nourishing foods that are too thick and difficult to digest, such as those containing barley cooked with water, broth, eggs, fish, cheese, fat, and large seeds and nuts.
Remember that bones break in the young and the elderly, it is not possible for them to continue and consolidate according to their nature except for the exhaustion of the limbs.
Moreover, nature herself adjusts and remembers that any broken bone in any part whatsoever, as long as there is swelling that adheres and strengthens that, until it is congealed and united together, until the end of inflammation and pain, as it is at the beginning, until any cause hinders that
Therefore it is necessary to suspend the feeding of the patient, foods that are weighty and viscous and large, as we have said above
Remember that the species of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limb, for example the fracture of the bone of the thigh is different from the fracture of the bone of the head; and the fracture of the bone of the foot is different from the fracture of the bone of the forearm; and so on with all the other limbs
And I recall from all the species of fractures that are exposed in the various chapters distinct from each other
Many different fractures exist in general And they are diversified in the species of fractures of the bone in general; for example, a fractured bone is fractured in different places; and sometimes a fracture is complete and sometimes it is incomplete, according to the length of the bone: and the fractures of the tibia and fibula are sometimes complete and sometimes incomplete, as it is in writing when prepared to be written, and it is a fractured bone with a wound and a disruption in the head, and it is a slight fracture.
And in every way it is an evil or torment in restoration of health according as will be remembered in their diverse places.
An omen of fracture of the bone. And for this it is known that the fracture of the bone: it is a twisting of the limb, and from that protrusion and appearance of the limb to the feeling, and so from it when it is compressed with your hand
And therefore when it is not in the limb a visible twisting or so it is not believed to be a fracture, you must touch the bone slightly when you touch it and the patient does not feel great pain, for there is no fracture here.
There is a possibility of a twisting or slight fracture, although you must not touch it with your hand or compress it in any way; there must be a pause in relation to the medicines of which you have remembrance at that moment that seems to be appropriate to that location; and so be strict for a stricture of the membrane.
And you must know that the limb when it is bent and is not split into two or anything else that does not happen to it in its stability, as for example the whole part of its circumference, the hour covers that you begin to rectify it from the moment it has happened because of the afterburn caused by the cautery
And if afterburn has happened because of the cautery, the hour leaves it for a few days until the afterburn ceases; and then equal it in any way that you can manage, either by raising it and by applying some unguent.
And you must know that the restoration of the limb and its strengthening is lighter than the fracture of the bone in which it has happened
And so strengthen it as will be remembered in time.
May be in the bone there is a fracture, however, the hour is necessary to extend this limb fractured from two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two strings or with one string and the hand.
And so your position should be such that you can keep the limb still in its natural position, while the fractured parts are extended from the limb, the hour teaches you that you must perform the return of those affections naturally and according to any way that you can manage in their places
And keep yourself according to your force that you do not cause pain to the patient by your operation of removing the fracture; and teach yourself according to the degree of power that you apply to one bone with the other companion according to many different ways
And you must take advantage at that moment of your touch with your hand to do so, and if sometimes here there is any other cause, rectify that and equal that for the amount of your virtue
And avoid violent extension and compression, as do many foolish doctors who make the afterburn happen because of their operation, or make it happen by contraction of the limb as we have seen in the operation of their foolish doctors.
And the quality of the stricture of the limb is that which I recommend; for you must know that fractured limbs are diverse in their smallness and greatness and in the form of those.
And as for those that are small such as the arm and the finger and the toe and the like, the hour teaches you that the covering should be of much fine material.
And as for those that are large such as the thigh or the chest, the hour teaches you that in those there should be a tight and strong covering that connects the great limb with the strong one throughout the stricture and equal, in order that there is no maculation in it
And so begin, so make your evacuation of equipment, pause the convenient ligament at that place where the fracture is to be made with three coverings or four as the limb deserves; and strengthen your hand a little on the ligament.
And so see that that which is most above the place of the fracture is strengthened, and strengthen less than that which you have strengthened the place of the fracture And so lengthen the covering of the place of the fracture a little, and soften the stricture little by little, until you have taken hold of a large part of the limb
And then take another instrument and cover that area with another bandage over the fracture, and cover the bandage around the periphery of the fracture; and let your operation be in the tension of the bandage and in the softening of that as we have said concerning the first bandage.
And leave between the incisions the space which is sufficient to cover the bending of the fracture, if there is bending of the fracture; and if not, do not leave it in any way
And leave on it another instrument, and cover these bandages well; if there is no swelling or oozing from the wound, and when the swelling has subsided; and leave that for a few days; and when you have finished with it strengthen the bands
And let the bands be of a sufficient width, and be made skillfully; or of silk thread; or of hemp cord; and let the width of each band be as follows: ...
However, let the support that is placed over that fracture be larger and narrower than the others, and the length of the support according to the size of the limb in magnitude and thinness; and strengthen the bands over the support with another instrument according to your first direction; and bind it securely according to what we have said of tension, and that your tension is greatest in the area of the fracture, and the more prolonged the fracture, the less the tension.
And let the threads be of a similar thickness and flexibility, and be of silk; and if the threads are coarse, thus you have seen concerning the operation of removing bone splinters from the wound, and that is a great error, when the tension is removed the equality is lost
And fine threads are not convenient, because you will not achieve tension with them over those things which you wish, and do not cover that there should be less than a finger between the supports.
And if the patient is suffering from this because of the extremities of the bones, then leave those that are outside the fracture well supported until they have healed without causing them damage.
Some bandages of fracture are like a plague, and accidental disruption in the cord, and I remind you of this in the head according to singularity
And remember that every fractured limb is not straight from the first day; the reason for which is that when the limb is large, do not leave it supported over the bands but wait a few days or more, according to your security regarding the appearance of swelling.
This is the manner of the plasters with which the Ancients restored fractures, which were placed over fractures and dislocations and twists.
Plastering manner like that of restoring a fracture, convenient for many complex things and especially for women and the elbows, because it is of that from which neither heat nor cold is felt: and take powder of lime, which is the marrow of the wheat that hangs over the movement of the marrow in the bones of the lime
And do it thus if you please, but soak it in glue so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and use that for that purpose
Another manner of dressing for fracture, dislocation and twist: recipe of asafoetida, lapdanum, acacia, enula, and marigold, which is ground from a thousand grains of fennel; of myrrh and aloe five grains; of aloes twenty grains. All these are triturated and sieved and are mixed with water with alum or with egg white if the patient's wound is raw; and use this dressing, for it is of good composition and restores the broken bones quickly, and gives comfort to the patient.</end_of_turn>
Another manner of dressing for which will give comfort to fracture and twist: recipe marigold and white alum root five grains; of myrrh and aloe five grains; of acacia six grains; of pomegranate seed two grains.
All things are pounded in mortar with a moistened container, and they are sifted, and they are boiled with water or vinegar and are administered.
Method of treating joints and bones separated from each other at those places, and when pain occurs in those and in fissures and fractures: take lanolin and immerse it in strong wine and oil cooked and place it over the area.</end_of_turn>
In this plaster there is no virtue of restoration, of cessation of pain, but it rather drives out pain properly.</end_of_turn>
Another method of plastering that restores the fracture: take mulberry bark and poppy seeds; mix them together and make plaster of them.</end_of_turn
Method of plastering abbreviated which is administered for the restoration of the fracture of bones and when you want to resolve the residue of swelling: take chamomile, violets and iris root, barley flour, all ground together.</end_of_turn> All things are pounded and sifted, and are boiled with wine, if the limb is not scorched.</end_of_turn>
If it is scorched, however, do so with lukewarm water of chamomile or with water and use it.</end_of_turn
Another method of plastering more solid in resolution than the first, when the accident is a deep swelling that you must restore the limb: take root of chamomile and linseed seed, barley, meadowsweet, marjoram, violets, chamomile, all ground together and linseed; all things are pounded and sifted and are boiled with broth or water or wine, as you deem convenient according to the quality of the limb and the degree of the color of it.</end_of_turn
Ipocras does not say that in the free belly there is anything that should be placed over the limb except to restore it, but rather that it should be greased with wax and oil and not anything else; and I recommend that it be milder between thickness and thinness.</end_of_turn
Indeed in Gaul it is seen that it is placed over the fractured limb in order to restore it, and the causes in which it is useful are small chills or coldness so as to compare with those causes that we have recommended.</end_of_turn
Method of plastering which relieves the lesion and pain: take rue, rue marigold, horsetail, cinnamon or pennyroyal, elderberry, salt, ground together; pound and sift them and mix them, and make plaster.</end_of_turn
The quantity according to which it should cover the ligament and prevent pain should be such that you consider if there is no risk of pain or swelling or the bone is not fractured it is not bad to leave it still for a few days.</end_of_turn And if there occurs at the limb severe pain or swelling or inflammation, then you must cover or remove it at that moment, and keep the plaster on it.</end_of_turn
Take sponge of linen and marine sponge dipped in warm water, and immerse that in cold water, and with that wash the limb until the swelling and pain are gone; and then place over it lanolin soaked in strong wine and oil or scented oil, and bind over it for a night until you are sure that the cautery has healed, and that the swelling of the limb has subsided, and that the pain has ceased.</end_of_turn
And do the same with the stricture little by little and remove the plaster little by little at the first constraint, and reduce it until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if sometimes the swelling and the redness and the pain and the inflammation and all those accidents have already passed, and digestion of plaster and constraint is required, then you must do the same as you did at the beginning when you began treatment.</end_of_turn
And if no other cause occurs in the limb of which we have spoken, then do not remove it until three or four or five or seven days.</end_of_turn And some doctors leave it like that for twenty days according to their custom for the healing of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture has healed, and until the coagulacion of the marrow over that has taken place.</end_of_turn
And do the same with the stricture more than in your first constraint throughout, and adjust in the swelling of the patient's food, according to the recollection of it.</end_of_turn
Indeed if sometimes the limb of the fracture is already dry and expanded more than that which covers it, then you must know that the nourishment is prohibited to go to that; and therefore give it only warm water in all these three days; and remove the constraint a little, and for this operation come to the limb the nourishment, and it will heal pleasantly.</end_of_turn
More than the fools who restore the fractured limb at the end rather than at the beginning, according to what is customary, and restore it carelessly, is an error according to their operation, and a great fear, and if they were more prudent, they would make the Ancients greater in their leisure and make them gentler with regard to this work.
And I have never seen anyone do it like that, for it is more reasonable that they do not do it.</end_of_turn>
Chapter: On fracture when it happens in the head.</end_of_turn>
The species of fractures are multiple, and their figures are diverse, and their causes are different, for any fracture is caused by a blow to the space, and the blow hinders all the bones within the cavity, which is left in place as it is, just as it is with a fistula, and because of this this species is called acephal; or the space strikes any part of the bone, and strikes the marrow but does not pass through to the back of the bone; and this species of fracture is called elevation absolute.</end_of_turn
And the plague of these two fractures is great or small, and of fracture that is contracted or contained; and the cause of it is a blow with a blunt or sharp object, and it persists.</end_of_turn
And this fracture is penetrating that approaches the nerve which is left in place; or is in the face of the bone, and the plague of these two fractures is great or small.</end_of_turn
And a fracture is that which is hidden in the bone, in the subtlety of the small vessel, and because of this it is called capillary fracture.</end_of_turn
And the fracture is caused either by a blow or by an impact or by a blow to the bone and it persists, which makes any lamina of the bone penetrate the parts adjacent, and is fatal in the hollow part just as when it happens to the nails when they are struck and some part of them enters the adjacent parts.</end_of_turn
Mostly it is fatal in the bones of humors, as well as their heads.</end_of_turn
And all these species of fractures are dangerous, as they are like shattered stars.</end_of_turn And I saw with regret all that is in this place.</end_of_turn
And I know all these species of fractures by recognition on those and by inquiry of them in order to test and determine the extent of the corruption of the marrow that is above them.</end_of_turn
The capillary fracture is known because it is discovered on the bone, and is evacuated, and is limited by a bandage, which covers the fracture so that it does not appear black.</end_of_turn
More than in the treatment of fracture one must take into consideration at the beginning the accidents of the patient, and when sometimes for the accidents that signify in their manifestation fear, such as vomiting of bile, and extension, and loss of consciousness, and loss of voice, and syncope, and high fever, and especially these symptoms of the patient, since in these cases the disease is not cured.</end_of_turn
And sometimes when the accidental symptoms do not cease, you hope for health, and when you begin the treatment of them.</end_of_turn
The cause is that if it is brought to your notice at the beginning like it is brought to your notice in the days of spring, you must study in the cavity of the bone until the fourteenth day according to all ability.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the summer days, you must cover the bone until the seventh day, having observed that anything left in the cavity of the bone is corrupted by the marrow, and that the symptoms that we have recommended appear.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture has already reached the marrow covering the cerebellum, and is contracted and contained, you must insert the small fragment and cauterize it, as I recommend to you.</end_of_turn
And that you shave the head of the patient who is plagued, and uncover the bone according to custom and handle it as you are able according to the figure of the plague, and that you are curious about the patient.</end_of_turn
And if it happens to you that you discover the bone, flux of blood or caut abscess, then you must oppose it with what you can and what covers it, and that you cover the area with a cloth soaked in wine and oil, and keep the plague still until the abscess subsides; and be sure that there is flux of blood; and begin immediately in the circulation of the bone and in the ablation of it.</end>
And this is according to two methods of operation.</end_of_turn>
And one way to treat it is that you insert another needle directly into the sore area, and this is how you do it: Insert another needle a little wider than the previous one. This is how you do it.
And thus you administer another needle a little wider than the previous one.
And know that you must call your needle various names, some of which are wider than others; and some are shorter than others and are in the back of the acuteness of their extremities, and they are of iron or felod
And use them easily in percussion on the needle so that you do not break the head and damage the latter
And if it is strong and hard, know that you must pierce in the circumference of it giving that you administer the needles along the edges, which are called superficial needles.
And they are not called thus except when the depth of the bone up to which you reach does not reach the point where the head of the bone appears like a small bulge or circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing the moisture of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a great number of these needles of which each one is suitable for the thickness of each bone, except when in all tests of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae the extremity which is acute should be taken in such a quantity in length and breadth as is appropriate for the quantity of moisture of that bone
And this is the form of three species of needles: The quality of perforating in the circumference of the fractured bone is that you place the needle on the bone and rotate it with your thumbs until you realize that the bone has already been pierced; and then change the needle to another place and suspend that which is between all the time the quantity of the thickness of the ray or remove that which is around it
And thus insert the needles between each two bones, and do that more subtly than you would over that which is at the end of the levitation, as we have said, until you have eradicated the bone, or with your hand, or by any other cause for some of the movements which are causing that, such as nails and fine forceps
And know that you must take great care that the needle does not touch any cause of the swelling
And thus when you pierce the bone in the circumference, and if it is continued with the swelling, extract that which is outside of the swelling, knowing that you must remove the bone that is similar to the needle, more especially if it is tough and hard than the others
And if any small fragments of bones and cartilage remain, know that you must take those away easily with that which is due to the movements; and thus care for the wound with liniment and ointment as we have said
And another method of operation is light, long and laborious, which is to dissect outward and inwards for a great space; and this is its term: it is necessary for you at the beginning to uncover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most violent and visible, until when you have uncovered that part and have left the extremity of that needle slow and leisurely from that, this is the form:
And that the blunt part is round and does not touch any cause, and the acute part is on two sides before and behind, as sometimes; that the blunt part should be adapted to the swelling on the face of it which is incident to the acute part on the bone.
And thus pierce the needle with a little blow with a small mallet so that the bone is easily rotated thus as we have said, and you must be sure that the needle does not slip and cause you any accident in any way, for the physician who is most learned of all men and the wisest of all is also mistaken.
And if there remains any attached cause to the bone in some place of the bone, pierce that which is at the extremity of the needle with the blunt part, and deliver that which is facilitated, which is loosened from it without difficulty and without pain.
And if the bone does not penetrate into the canal, and what is broken or remains of the bone is on the face of it, and remains in the swelling and subtiles cartilages, know that you must remove that swelling and eradicate those cartilages with fine instruments as many as you have prepared for the purpose, in various quantities so that you can easily administer them in all places and the most convenient way of them according to what you have lost in your operation that bone fractured and its shape
And know that you must administer with the greatest care of those ratios which you have taken at the beginning of the most wide of those ratios, and thus use almost the least of the most subtle of them, and do not cease until you have administered the greatest and the most subtle of all of them.
May be in some other small fractures of the capillaries or subtle fracture, cover that you administer care according to what you have lost to rectify them.
And it is because it is not known to us about all of those things that have been studied in that art And this is what we have shown in great fractures
And if the tumor is rectangular when you radiate it from the bone, then cover that you take hold of it according to the amount of the plague, and immerse it in olive oil, and place it over the orifice of the plague; and take another sponge doubled or tripled and immerse it in wine and olive oil and place it over the sponge first and do what is necessary so that the pus comes out without damaging it; and immediately administer about it some slippery fat, and do not tighten it until the amount of the plague is reduced alone
And leave that like this for a day or two until you are certain that the inflammation has subsided; and then remove it and immediately administer medicines that are useful for drying, such as flaxseed and oatmeal, powdered gentian and arnica, and similar things to those.
And it is that you grind these medicines into powder that is spread over the plague; and universally, administer any medicine that has the property of drying, which does not destroy.</start_of_turn>
And keep in mind your ability that the plague in your care should be dry; neither should you add grease to it or anything else; nor should you allow any violence in it; for when it is applied to the bone of the skull, it corrupts that and weakens it, and causes illness to the patient immediately.</start_of_turn>
And it happens in the head of the limb, as it makes the bone brittle and more so when the care is deficient, and is black on its surface; and therefore consider that if you cause illness to the patient the accidents that we have said, knowing that it is dangerous to do so at all times.</start_of_turn
And if it does not cause blackness except for the medicine that is stopped, and it is in virtue of that medicine that causes that blackness, then cover that you take a little more of the medicine and some olive oil three parts. and mix with these lines a sponge, and place it over the head; and care for it with the spices of care that you consider until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Of the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.</start_of_turn>
Know that the nose is not fractured but rather two fragments of bone that rest so close together that in them there are two bones, for the fragment that is left is cartilaginous and is not fractured and does not cause it any harm but rather itching and swelling and sleeplessness.</start_of_turn
When one of the two fragments is fractured, then cover that you insert a little inside the nose and that you stabilize that fracture with the thumb and the index finger, until the nose returns to its natural shape.</start_of_turn And be helpful to you in this, and keep in mind that you should not be harsh with your patient during this operation.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and you say no to that, then cover that it should be equal to the extremity of the ray in which it is small in size.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is in two fragments, then do the same for it.</start_of_turn
And cover that you restore it on the first day of the fracture if possible; and if not, then cover that you keep it still for ten days before resuming the cautery.</start_of_turn
And put on the limb of the nose a sponge of lint, if the fracture is in one fragment, or two cushions, if the fracture is in two fragments, and the cushion should be of such size that it fills the cavity of the nose.</start_of_turn
And tell the old restorers that the cushions should be bound in border, and that they should be changed throughout the day, although I do not see it; because it has to cover that the sponge should be moistened with album of hue with fragrant powder; and immediately remove the bandage when the bone is firm and the cartilage is hardened.</start_of_turn
And some people put cloves in the nose instead of a cushion, because they are more likely to cause pus than the sponge that is covered with lint; and that the fracture of the nose is already violent enough and that the patient should not be prohibited from inspiration.</start_of_turn
This cause is not for you; if you wish, do this, or do that.
If another purulent wound appears after the cautery, plaster over the nose with cerate or pitch infused with wine vinegar and rosemary oil, or with diaquilon.
Even if no further wound appears after the cautery, it is necessary to plaster the surrounding area with oatmeal and powdered hen's feathers mixed with glue from hog fat; and place your hand over it to stop the bleeding, and do not touch the nose for any reason.</start_of_turn>
Even if the bones of the nose are fractured slightly or displaced, it is necessary to split open the skin over them, and extract them with the instruments that are suitable for these; and then close the wound, and care for that which has been torn and consolidated, and plaster as needed.</start_of_turn
And if there is a wound in the palate of the nose, it is necessary to treat that with calamus and administer lead canulas until it is completely healed.</start_of_turn>
Chapter III.</start_of_turn
Of restoration of the jaw when it is fractured.</start_of_turn
When the jaw is fractured and the fracture is not associated with a wound, it is necessary to know if the fracture is displaced only, and not fractured in two and curved towards the palate, for in this case its sensation will be slight.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth; and in the same way, if the fracture is on the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand; and with both hands support the prominence of the fracture towards the outside, as much as possible.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two parts, it is necessary to administer extension of two parts according to the rectitude until it is possible to equal them.</start_of_turn
And if there is displacement of teeth with disruption, strengthen those which you expect to remain with gold or silver or ivory; and place a cerate on the fractured jaw, and a double layer on the fractured area, and a thick gauze pad appropriately placed; and bind loosely as much as is necessary for the application to be maintained, until it is not destroyed.</start_of_turn
Command the patient to rest and be calm, and abstain from eating strong foods.</start_of_turn
And if you see that the figure has already been altered in any way, cover it and remove it on the third day; and then rectify what has already been altered of it and plaster the area with powdered charcoal, glue from hog fat, or oatmeal, because you must leave it without any support, and put a layer of gauze over the plaster.</start_of_turn
And when it is fixed and adjusted that plaster over it, and the disposition of the bone is not altered, leave it like that, without removing it until it is healed and the fracture is strengthened; for if it is pulled out before it is completely healed, it will be stretched in three parts.</start_of_turn
And if another purulent wound appears after the cautery, administer what has been said above about the sensation of the wound until it is healed, and remove that wound.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is associated with a wound, consider whether it is a fracture of the separated bone or a displacement, for in this case you must order that those displacements be removed with what is suitable for their removal.</start_of_turn
And if the wound is wide, widen it with the flebotomy according to the amount of your need.</start_of_turn
And when you have removed those displacements, and of those you will not remove them, cover the wound if it is wide; or if not, put on one of the plasters that you consider suitable and support that which is necessary, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Chapter V.</start_of_turn
Of restoration of the thyroid when it is fractured.</start_of_turn
A purulent wound occurs at the base of the thyroid, alongside the muscle, and that fracture is caused in three ways.</start_of_turn
For it is fractured, displaced, or separated into two parts without displacement; and it is necessary to know the restoration of it; or that there is displacement of the fragments, and it is difficult to restore them; or that the fracture is associated with a wound.</start_of_turn
And in that operation, when the fracture is displaced, it is necessary that two assistants be present: one to hold the fractured fragment and follow its trajectory, and the other to extend the limb beyond that part.
Then tightly bind the fracture with strips so that its shape is restored as it should be, neither too taut nor too loose
And if you wish to extend more, then stop when you perceive the patient is suffering from pain, either from fat or from blood, and make the limb larger according to the amount of your need; extend and elevate the limb and compress the wound with your hand until the fracture is bound as it should be
And if you are unable to draw out the limb from the wound, because it is too deeply embedded, then rest the patient on their chest, and place a cushion under their muscles, a little wider in size
And the assistants will hold the limb against the wound until the bone of the fracture is elevated above the wound, and when you have corrected the fracture, bind it tightly with strips
Even if you feel the limb hanging limp and maimed, then rest on that and extract those limpness with ease.
And if it is retained in the bone, then make an incision of the limb with one of the instruments which you have prepared at that time, because you have already stopped the tremor of the limb which is causing the pain; that tremor is of bone or of marrow from which this is the form of it:
It is similar to the pliers from which this is the shape; and its width is according to what you need of it, according to the size of the bone or the thinness of the bone.
The length of the limb should be as much as possible for the operation; so that there are two extremities as many times as necessary, and one extremity is wide and the other narrow
And if the disruption of the wound which you have incised when you have extracted the limpness from the bone is wide, and you are sure of the haemostasis, then you will adjust the two edges of the wound with sutures
And if the disruption is slight, or you fear haemostasis, then you will close the wound with gauze and powder according to the extent of the wound opening
And if haemostasis is delayed, then immerse the limb in vinegar and oil, and place over it.
And finally, that the splint should not be too tight over the fractured bone; so that you can see the patient's limb every day, because when the ligament is softened or the splint has already become softened, then you must correct this and strengthen the bandage.
And finally, keep the patient's limb resting on the chest, and put under the limb a small cushion at night; so that the adjutors of the limb are raised from the side of the limb, and thus the fracture of the limb is raised to the level of the muscle; or that the arm of the limb is bound to the chest of the limb.
Do not remove the ligament if it has not spontaneously come loose or bled within twelve days.
And if you have seen the face of the limb at that time, renew the plaster and adjust the stiffness and restore that which is necessary and leave it until the fracture of the limb is restored and the haemostasis is complete
The limb is strengthened and comforted according to the month in xxviii days, and some walks in the house will suffice in a month of time from that
End of treatment.
Recovery from a fracture of the femur.
The fracture of the femur is fractured in the lateral part of the limb and is not fractured through the middle of the bone.
Therefore, when the limb is fractured in the middle and the break is not recognized until it is palpated, the degree of the fracture should be judged by its shape, and it should be reduced in such a way as to restore its natural position in every way possible.
Then place a pad of cotton around the wound and stop the bleeding; and sprinkle the wound with powdered alum; and place another pad of cotton over it as much as is necessary.
If the pin has a concave surface in some parts of the wound, then hold that concavity down with a pad and stop the bleeding; and then put the pin back according to equality
Then stretch downwards with your thumb and hold the pin with your fingertips until it is well fixed in its place.
Consider the ligament in each day; and when it is swollen, tie another bandage and stretch them both until the pin is well fixed in its place
I bring the patient to the side of the bed.
The pin will be restored in xx days or in .xxv days
And when this number has elapsed, then take down the ligature, and know that the fracture from which it began is no longer to be feared or dissolved.
If the procedure proceeds from the ankle bone and you leave the cord attached, then cut over it, and keep it there, and do as has been said concerning the fracture of the collarbone at the back of the scapula in case this should happen here too

On the restoration of the foot fracture.
When several wounds appear in the middle of the foot and these are towards the end; but the extremities of the foot must be sound so that they can walk without pain
As for the accidents of the foot when the middle is fractured, they are accompanied by a decline in the pulse and cause great pain, difficulty in walking, nausea, vomiting and great swelling; and it is declared in the cavity of the broken bone and is not hidden from the sense
And the restoration is that you rest the patient on the side of the bed, and put between the buttocks of the patient a cushion; and then press on the muscles of the foot, and adjust the waist of the patient against the two buttocks, and keep the limb in the operation and in the equalization as much as is possible and convenient, until the limb returns to its normal shape.
Then place a plaster or bandage over the wound and stop the bleeding; and hold over a spatula of gauze or cloth and keep them suspended in the air; because you are going to cover it. And keep covered over the broken bone that it is not painful; and keep on tightening each bandage every time a wound appears, and stretch that which is too tight downwards; and consider the bandage at all times, and when it is swollen strengthen that
And if necessary to cause the swelling to subside, pain, or swelling that occurs in the limb, then you should remove the cast and perform drainage; and rectify what has happened by means of care; and then reduce the plaster, sometimes slightly; and adjust the stricture so that it is healthy

On the restoration of the back when it is fractured.
Know that a fracture of the back does not take place except in the upper parts which follow the two; and from the extremities of the part from which it begins no pain occurs except for what is contained in the cartilage. And it is recognized that it is not hidden from the sense, you must ask about it from the patient
And the restoration is that you bind the fracture as it is said according to the possibility, except that you bind it as much as possible; and then plaster and strengthen the broken bone with a pin, if you wish.
And if the fracture of the back is declining towards the buttocks, then it causes acute pain and puncture, just as if it were a puncture that had happened to the lungs; and for this reason it is difficult to manage, nausea, vomiting and great suffering; and this is a difficult case to treat
And already the ancients have devised in this way to manage it.
And so they say: keep the patient away from meals that cause swelling and wind, so that the belly is flat and extended, and the fracture is not displaced from the outer parts
May we now inquire as to the cause of this so that it does not become a cause of further discomfort; and if it has already occurred, then it will help us to know.
And I say concerning this that it is necessary to hold the wind down and that it should be suspected that it is for this reason; for indeed it is similar to reasoning, but I fear that the wind will drive the humors to the area by the weakening.
And I say concerning this: cover the area with a cloth that is already submerged in caut oil, and place powder between the buttocks until it is full; let the ligature be loose when you wrap around that according to the roundness; and indeed treat the patient with the care of pleurosi of food and medicine
And if the patient causes violent constriction which he does not suffer, and you must puncture the skin with a pointed needle, beware of the patient, for when you cover over the area, uncover the broken edge, and indeed place your hand over that instrument which conserves the cavity, remembering that which precedes is the cause, and that they happen with ease, and extract that.
And indeed adjust the two lips of the wound, if it is large, by boiling, and treat that with plasters until it is healed.
And if it has already occurred, do not hesitate to cover and press down powder in rose oil over the area, and cover over the area that the apostema has occurred; and indeed treat the patient with that which covers the apostema that has occurred.</start_of_turn>
And rest upon the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.</start_of_turn>

Of the restoration of the fracture of the body of the vertebra and the facet.</start_of_turn
When some veins are affected by fracture in the bones of the heel, and the area is to be treated, it is similar to the vertebrae of the back.</start_of_turn And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he is healed or not, consider that sometimes the nerves are already softened and stunned, and dead, and you cannot move them or extend or bend them without causing them pain; when you tighten them with your hands or pierce them with a needle, and you do not feel pain in them, it is clear that they are not healed, and in such a case it is mortal.</start_of_turn
And if you do these things and feel the constriction in them with your hands, and pierce them, it is clear that the bone marrow is saved and the patient will recover with care.</start_of_turn
And if the vertebrae of the heel look like those of the back and you want to know if they are healed or not, consider the feet.</start_of_turn
Indeed, sometimes when they are already softened, it happens in the most painful way, because of the wind and the urge to urinate, which is their will, and many veins are suffocated and rest supine on the two heels and are unable to urinate, and it is clear that this is mortal, and you should not work in the care of these.</start_of_turn
May there not be any other cause of these, for the cause is better and lighter.</start_of_turn
And the treatment of these is that you perforate with a cautery needle to the depth of the apostema that rests on the fractured vertebra, applying olive oil or warm packs; place over that any herbs that the veins may tolerate until the apostema is sedated.</start_of_turn
And indeed suspend one of the supportive plasters and exist, and tighten over that which is liamed; and command the patient to rest and be calm and not to sleep on the part where he feels pain until he is healed.</start_of_turn
And if it happens that the bone of the heel has become loose or any other cause that has already been separated from it, it is necessary to ligate over the heel and remove that bone; and indeed adjust the two lips of the wound, with sutures if it is large; and indeed treat that with the care of the attendants, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
May it be fractured at the back of the heel bone, and at the end of the limb, it is necessary to put your left hand under the heel and grasp the fractured bone with your right hand as much as is possible for an equal proportion; and indeed place over that a plaster and bandage, if necessary, and tighten that.</start_of_turn
And if you feel the heel bone fractured in them, it is necessary to lift that up, and keep that, and treat the wound with the care that precedes until it is healed.</start_of_turn

De restauracio de la ancha.
The bones of the thighs are fractured, and if they fracture, the pain in their limbs is not simply a communication at their extremities but extends along their length and descends to the buttocks; and this causes pain in the belly and puncture, and the limb is stupefied when fractured.</end_of_turn>
And the restoration of them is that you extend your hand over that which is over the fracture, which is its shape.</end_of_turn>
And if the fracture is at the extremity alone, then you embrace that part which is exposed as much as is necessary to restore it to its natural shape.</end_of_turn
More so if the fracture is in the loin or that it already descends to the buttocks, then you must press the pain against the lower belly until it is ready for the restoration of the fracture.</end_of_turn> And therefore when you have restored that, place an embastment over it, and then place another bandage of wool or linen, and tighten securely so that you do not fear puncture of the fracture or displacement of the bone.</end_of_turn
And embrace the concavity with what is above that which supports the restriction according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on the side or recline on the side of the chest.</end_of_turn
More so if after treatment with cautery, the pain persists, then you cease the extension and restoration until the cautery has subsided, and place your hand over that until it is quiet; and then return to the restoration of it, and tighten as before.</end_of_turn
And if it happens in the heel bones or are crushed, then you must amputate them.</end_of_turn>

Restoration of the fracture of the limb.
The limb is that which is between the hip and the shoulder.</start>
And if it is fractured, the restoration of it is in two ways, of which one is to grasp the thigh with a pad of coarse wool according to this fashion:
And join in two extremities two ligaments, and then suspend it from the elevated place.</start
Keep the patient on a stool; and when the fractured limb is placed on the thigh, bring the heel of the limb to the middle of the thigh where the curvature of the thigh is located.</start
And if there is any hard cause, or a minister extends that to the lower parts; and the physician should hold the fracture firmly in place until the fracture returns as it should.</start
And the other way is that the patient lies on the chest and suspend the hand of the limb at the collarbone; and command two attendants that one should hold that which is above the fracture at its most; and the other should hold the foot of the limb; and whoever of them extends to their side.</start
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then tighten on the fracture with both ligaments and on that with the other, and whoever of the two attendants extends both of his sides.</start
Therefore if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, cover that half of the ligament over the trochanter and the other half over the fracture beyond the hip bone.</start
Similarly if the fracture is close to the hip bone, cover that ligament over that place and over the hip bone.</start
Embrace that and facilitate the work, and when it is well embraced as it should be, tighten that if it is not after treatment with cautery.</start
More so if after treatment with cautery, leave the restriction until the seventh day, and place over it a soft bandage of wool and oil of rosemary until the cautery has subsided, and then tighten that once more.</start
The way to tighten that is to place an embastment over the fracture, and then place a soft bandage over the embastment; and adjust the limb over that limb, and keep your hand open over the muscle.</start
And keep the limb still and tighten on the limb the arms so that the limb is in the place of the steps, if it does not prevent any cause of the fractured bone.</start
And use crutches.</start
And place over the fracture that heel that is more broad and strong than the others; and place between each heel the width of the thumb, and the length of the bones according to the fracture in addition to three fingers from the whole side.</start
And now stretch over the starches and the stiffness which I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And so the stiffness over the area of the fracture must be very taut. And when the fracture is long, the stiffness must be less taut
Therefore, if sometimes the position of the starches and the stiffness are as we said when restoring the limb to its normal position, then do so slowly
And if you fear afterburn, then leave the stiffness and the starches inside for seven days as we have said before
And so consider the ligament in all its parts for three days so that it does not become inflamed or swollen; or eating is prohibited in order to prevent the limb from becoming swollen due to excessive stiffness; and therefore correct all this as we have said before.
May be if you are confident that no harmful cause is at hand, do not remove the ligature for more than three days or so.<end_turn>
And let the patient rest from their ailment on their side, and their hands more on their stomach.
And pause over the attendants who are eating broth full of wool, and consider at every hour of the night or day that it is not swollen or dissolved the figure of the fractured limb, or that the ligament is softened, therefore correct all this with your prudence.
And abstain from eating for the patient according to the order that we have given more, namely that eating should be mild at first until it is stretched; and so keep them from eating excessively.
Concerning the attendants and the change of position of the patient, it is necessary that they be strengthened for forty days; and so keep them from being discharged and give them baths, and let them be medicated with those things which correct this
And if the fracture is late, then do not remove the ligature from that limb for up to a month or up to two months.
Chapter XII.</start_of_turn>
Of the restoration of the fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two knuckles; of which one is small, and that is called the thumb, and the other is large and that is called the index finger, from the part beyond the thumb.
And it is strong if only the large knuckle is fractured, or only the small one, and it is strong if both are fractured together
And when the small knuckle is fractured, the restoration of the limb is easier, and the healing is easier
And when the large knuckle is fractured, the fracture of the limb is bad, and the healing is difficult
And worse of all is when both bones are fractured together
Therefore, if the fractured bone is the small one, it is convenient for the doctor to delay the restoration of the limb, which has little extension, until that is healed
But if the large knuckle is fractured, then you must keep the extension even more still
And if both bones are fractured together, you must keep the limb still for a longer time
And you must keep the figure of the hand still during the restoration of the limb and the extension of the limb supported on a cushion, and that the thumb is lower than the other fingers, and that the patient is sitting on a cushion
And let there be a cushion under the limb at the front or at the back, so that the patient does not suffer from pain.
And so the attendants extend the arm from the part beyond the thumb towards the shoulder or towards the ligament, and the other attendants extend it in the same way.
And so the doctor should heal the bone until it is reduced according to the best figure that can be obtained
And if in the account of the bone there is swelling, then you must perforate the whole foot in the limb with your prudence.
And if there appears a separate swelling that you do not hope will heal in the restoration of the limb, then you must remove it according to the way we have said before
And if the fracture is with pus, and I have already spoken of this particular case, take care of that case as well
If at the beginning of your treatment an ulcer should happen to break out, then immediately line a circle around the affected area with fat of olive and white wax, and more especially between spicula and subtleness, and stretch the fat around that which is strict and subtle until the ulcer is released; and then keep the fat and stop plaster prepared from powdered gypsum and clay of hue, and approach steadily; and let the plaster be as firm as the surrounding bone.
Indeed, the name of the bones of the arm is seen in greater arrangements, or the fracture in a socket or in two sockets together.
And approach your stricture over the area of the fracture more firm and violent, and when more than that be strict to the upper parts of the fracture or to the lower parts of them, stop the stricture a little more soft as it was at the beginning of the injury
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough, and the thread with which it is tied should be of itself more especially between subtle and coarse, as we have recommended.
Consider the limb and the ligament nearby for several days. And if any cause occurs that requires rectification, as for example that which occurs to the limb, then cover that you bandage the limb with cold water until that cause ceases to exist.
And keep the limb still until rest, and then remove the stricture.
And if the swelling has already gone down and the bone has already recovered and remains like that, then rectify everything with your art
And consider more if the nourishment is prohibited from reaching the limb because of the stricture, for the swelling must be diminished for a little while until the nourishment reaches it, and then strengthen that
Moreover, if no other cause of those which we have said should occur to the patient, then do not allow it to be loosened for about xx days or around those.
And let the patient suspend their hand for the sake of its violent movement, and make them sleep on two cushions.
Indeed, this fracture is healed in xxx days or in xxxii days, or the limb is healed in xxviii days, and all this according to the configuration of the complications and the capacity of the art
Chapter XIII.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the thumb and the fingers.
Indeed, in the thumb of the hand and in the joints of the fingers there must be a fracture, and it does not happen to them except by blunt blows from objects covered with soft material
And when a fracture or tear happens to the hand, then the patient must continue to rest and bend it lightly as before, and place their hand over that which is extended
And the minister extends the fractured bones and the doctor unites them until they are reunited with good union
And keep the plaster still and stop, if there is no ulcer; and approach the plaster downwards according to the degree of the wound, and you have already covered that with fat.
Moreover, if the fracture is in the lower part of the palm you must hold the palm of the hand, and make the patient keep stretching that which has the fractured bone; and strengthen that with the palm of the hand itself
And let the limb be supported on a cushion so that the limb is applied to the palm; and strengthen that as much as covers
Moreover, if the fracture is on the outside, then keep the other plaster away from the palm, so that the hand is open and closed; and stop the stricture, just as the hand is rotated between the fingers with the ligaments
And if a fracture happens to one of the joints of the fingers, if it is said to be loose, let it be united as much as covers and strengthen it with the palm, and if you wish, place a bandage over the little joint to elevate the fracture and not to bruise it
Moreover, if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle, ring, index or thumb, let it be united and bound with the finger itself; or bind them all together as a whole, which is better; or place a plaster over that little joint, as we have said before
Consider in your restoration, and approach that which opposes the ulcer — with your art — as well as what covers when any cause of those which we have said should occur should arise, according to what is repeated in the narrative of the case
Capitol XIV.
Chapter XIV.
When the bone of the thigh is fractured, it is observed that it is broken and is declared according to the feeling that it is converted to the part below and to the surrounding pus.</end_of_turn>
And the restoration is done in this way that the ligament is stretched over the fracture and another ligament leaves the fracture, and the patient is placed prone on the belly and on the face.</end_of_turn
And the minister extends all the ligament to its part according to its quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.</end_of_turn
Maybe if it is near the hip, then let the supporting ligament be to the nail at the part of the fifth, so that the extension rests on it, and the other ligament leaves the fracture.</end_of_turn
Similarly, if the fracture is near the nail, then let the supporting ligament be to the nail, and let the extension be to the parts beyond.</end_of_turn
And the doctor should bite the bone with both hands as much as necessary until it is reduced according to the natural form, and the bone is joined by a good connection; the hour that the plaster and the dressing should be covered, if it does not happen to the limb afterwards.</end_of_turn But if it happens in the limb afterwards, let it lie for a few days until the swelling has gone down, and then return to your care.</end_of_turn
The bandage of the limb should be thus fixed: cover the fracture with a hard bandage, and bend it two or three times, and tie up the excess; and then cover the limb until it reaches the thigh and the hip.</end_of_turn
And insert a long thread between the thigh and the limb near the nail at the parts beyond, and bring the extremities of the thread from the part furthest from the nail to the part nearest to the nail, and then pass over the limb and the thigh as much as the bandage allows.</end_of_turn
And rest on the thigh in the place of that fracture, and rest a staple on the bone of the limb.</end_of_turn
And fill the spaces between the limb and the thigh with soft cloths, so that the bleeding is stopped.</end_of_turn>
And begin to bind firmly from the middle over the place of the fracture with three bands or four, and when you have gone as far as the ligament of the place of the fracture, your binding should be less tight and more comfortable and softer.</end_of_turn
And extend the two ends of the thread to the parts beyond until it reaches the ankle, and strengthen both ends of the nails of the other side so that the ligament is not strained in the place.</end_of_turn
And let the bandage rest upon that, where it is thus that no accident happens to the limb crooked or swelling or inflammation and that it remains as before; and if any of these things happen, then immediately take it away and remedy what has happened as soon as possible, as we have said above.</end_of_turn
But if in the bone where it is placed is bad of the bone that you put in, then let that be taken away as soon as possible; and if that is not possible, leave it and care for what has happened before that it should recover.</end_of_turn
And every bandage is strengthened in this fracture of the thigh by means of the nails, as we have said in the instructions and in the arms.</end_of_turn
But indeed in the restoration of it in this way it does not happen to the patient to walk; and if it is restored alone, without applying the other bandage, it is necessary that he should walk from that from which he had to rest.</end_of_turn
And you must know that the thigh is strengthened in forty days or a few months or a few weeks.</end_turn><end_turn>
Chapter XV.</end_turn>
Of the restoration of the fracture of the ankle bone.</end_turn
You must know that the fracture of the ankle bone is usually caused by a tear.</end_turn
But if it happens to be a fracture, it is not anything more than a crack or break in its parts, and that is like a bruise or swelling, and over that all is at rest according to the feeling.</end_turn><end_turn>
The restoration of the patient is that it should be gradually warmed up again with what has been broken of its parts as much as possible, so that it is reunited and connected as well as possible for equality, ease, and fabrication.
Then place a plaster and hold it over the round heel if you deem it necessary; and strengthen the surrounding structure as much as convenient.</end_of_turn>
Consider all the precautions that have been recommended in other fractures, thus as apostema cautery and similar to those that are opposed to any accident that may occur until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XVI.</end_of_turn>
On the restoration of the fracture of the limb.</end_of_turn
Know that in the limb there are two bones, of which one is thick and is called the limb; and the other is thin, and is called the bone.</end_of_turn
And concerning every kind of fracture that may happen to both bones of the arm, and for what reason the restoration of the limb is as necessary as the restoration of the arm itself, and the operation for it is one.</end_of_turn
And if both bones are fractured together, the limb is converted into fragments.</end_of_turn
And if only the thin bone is fractured, the limb is converted into fragments.</end_of_turn
And if only the thick bone is fractured, you must leave it as it is, for these are the causes that you must not neglect.</end_of_turn
Then administer extension, equality and ligation of the fragments according to the healing.</end_of_turn
But indeed, if the fracture of the limb is slight and has not caused significant swelling, that the extension should be milder and lighter, and relieve with your skill.</end_of_turn
And in the limb there is any cause for operating on the arm, and that is when you have healed the stars and when you have completed the whole operation, then you will take away the pins that were placed because of the causes that were present in the beginning; align them with those that have little greatness, and do not be greedy of the hands, and make them as long as the limb itself and as much as the bone allows.</end_of_turn
And cover with two coverings of sufficient length over each wound according to their length, and hold one over the part of the limb from one side and the other from the other side, and keep them from the bone inwards.</end_of_turn
And tie the two pins in three places at the two extremities and at the middle part, so that the structure of the limb is prohibited from leaning to the right and left, and is well fixed.</end_of_turn
And an ankle brace has been administered according to the length of the limb; and keep the limb still in it so that it conserves that movement.</end_of_turn
And more than anything, cover what is fractured properly, and when it is like that it is a proper treatment.</end_of_turn
Consider in every day the limb and study it carefully, and you will guard it from apostema and swelling or other causes similar; and when any of these causes occurs, then withdraw it from it until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XVII.</end_of_turn
On the fracture of the ankle and the bones of the foot and the toes.</end_of_turn
The ankle does not suffer from a complete fracture; however, the bones of the foot suffer from several breaks; and as for the toes, little or no fracture occurs in them, and it does not happen to them except for inflammation in the midst of the situation.</end_of_turn
And if the bones of the foot must be fractured and sometimes those bones must be elevated between them, then place the patient's foot on the prepared earth as if walking.</end_of_turn
Then place one foot on what is elevated from those bones, and chalk those, and press, and restore those until they are back in their places.</end_of_turn
Then place a plaster and stop the bleeding, and place under the belly of the foot a little stool on which are two plaster heads.</end_of_turn
And strengthen what is around the foot so that it is well stretched, because you have covered it with cloths and with other causes of which you do not approve.</end_of_turn
And when three or four days have passed, then you shall loosen the ligament, whereupon you will find the bones swollen, fractured or dislocated, and the operation in such cases is as follows.
Moreover, if some say they are fractured, then restore them, and bind them as before, just as you have learned in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.</end_of_turn> Then place a bandage around the fractured finger according to the length of the finger, and leave a little space between it and the bone; and place upon it the bandage which has been recommended to you, and strengthen that bandage downwards.</end_of_turn>
Moreover, if the bones are fractured two or three or more, then hold over each finger the quantity of bandage that is wrapped around the limb, and strengthen the bandage at the base of the foot, and keep your hand on one of the edges of the bandage for good retention.</end_of_turn>
And it is convenient for you to remember that you must not neglect the other causes which have been mentioned to you in other fractures of accidents which we have mentioned; and be attentive to every accident in which there is suspicion.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XVIII.</end_of_turn>
Of fracture of the bone of the thigh and of the heel bone and of the ankle bone.</end_of_turn
When the bone of the thigh is fractured, then cease in the cavity of the buttocks, and incline that towards the part of the thigh with two little ones, and keep it pressed from behind.</end_of_turn
And put the mattress under the thigh, and bind the thigh as before; and keep the two little ones firm, so that all that is outside is forgotten until the part of the thigh has returned to its normal position and the fractured bone has returned.</end_of_turn
And keep powder upon the two little ones, and when you wish to urinate, it will be easier for you to do so; and reduce and return that according to the manner in which you commenced, and keep the powder returned from the beginning.</end_of_turn
And do thus for seven days or until the other has recovered.</end_of_turn>
And if you wish, take once a vessel of vinegar and strengthen over the hole of the thigh a tube of gutta; and introduce all the vinegar into the thigh, and keep the vinegar well shaken within the tube until the vinegar has deflated within the thigh, because the fracture has returned.</end_of_turn
And keep the thigh well bandaged for some days as we have recommended, until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And when the heel bone of the foot or the thigh bone is fractured, then administer in the restoration and strengthening of them all that we have recommended for the ankle bone.</end_of_turn
And what is hidden in these principal fractures is not hidden in these external fractures, for it is little that we lack in this matter; rather, to whomsoever it may concern, I understand this book well; for that fracture signifies to you in the greatest possibilities of restoration and stricture of them.</end_of_turn
Moreover, when the ankle bone is fractured, take a bandage of wool and put the ankle in that; and keep the bandage over the wound, and be well bound, and leave it for three days or until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XIX.</end_of_turn
Of the restoration of fractures of the bones when it is soft.</end_of_turn
It is convenient in those who have suffered a fracture with soft swelling, especially if the bone is great as in the case of the tibia or the fibula, or is similar to this, that you take care of them and keep them still as much as possible, even if the symptoms of swelling are not significant or do not testify to the need for treatment as we have said.</end>
And if the swelling subsides, then cover that you keep the limb still as much as possible, as much as the powder which you have poured over it allows, if for another reason this is not present.</end>
And begin to restore the fracture in that same day, and do not prolong it, if nothing else follows.</end
Moreover, if there is a relapse of the fracture, then leave the restoration of the limb until the relapse has gone away, and do not approach it on the third day and the fourth day of all, for you will cause other accidents.</end
Moreover, if the fractured bone is prominent over the edge of the wound, then cover that you perforate to reduce it and restore it as easily and with little extension.</end
Mays si extencionem non est ad te parata et aequatio ejus est ad tieuas maxime, horae tu reduces eandem ad tuas maxime ad hoc sturmentum; et est sturmentum quod est factum de ferro, longitudinem eius est septem aut octo, latitudinem eius secundum quantitatem plagae; et propter hoc est necessari medicum precognoscere tres aut quattuor secundum quantitatem quam indicat ad hoc in curacione in omni specie fracturae.
Indeed, and let there be little swelling in them so that the price of the treatment is not doubled at the time of the operation.
And let there be an opening at the acute extremity to which the margin is brought; and let the dressing of it be removed with great care, and as much as possible from the root to the end
This is the way to do it:
And it is called in Greek “labre volentz atelarem”, so it is little pale
Because it covers that the acute limb be elevated above the prominent limb
And put it in a groove until the bone returns, and let it be equaled with any price.
And therefore strive to equalize the extremities of the fracture between them, and if the fractured extremity is subtle, and does not take that pain away, then it is necessary that you insert the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over it
Indeed, if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have recommended, then cut away that which covers the intestines which we have mentioned; or saw that with one of the saws in whatever way you can
And then scrape away that which remains on the bone of asperity and small sores
And when the bone is reduced, and the patient finds great pain, then understand that the bone has not been returned to its natural place; and then do what you can to comfort the patient greatly
When the restoration of the bone is completed, which you have made to the bone, and when the patient has undergone immersion in black vinegar, and properly so if it is summer, and do not place on the wound grease or any other cause in which there is oil, so that it does not cause swelling and corruption
And then administer sponges at the time of the meal as a supplement to the restoration of the bone, and leave the wound uncovered until it has been covered with forceps and dressings according to the quantity of the wound
And take care that you do not strain the wound at the fracture, for many doctors have seen that this causes further harm to the patients, and that it is better to leave the patient alone rather than to cause him further harm, so that he may recover. And if the stiffness of the joint is slight, soft, different from the stiffness of other fractures
And if the wound is large or is a bad wound, and you fear about that limb which we have recommended, and if there is pain in the area, then do not put on that plaster, but rather make a covering of gauze on the limb instead of sponges and strengthen it with those
And when a couple of days have passed since the wound has begun to heal, that there should be a swelling in it, then remove the bandage which you had placed on that because of the vinegar, and administer calamine, which is what we usually do to treat wounds, thus as well as administering tetracycline and resembling that.
And remind you that you must remove the ligament and consider the wound every morning and evening until it is consolidated and stopped, and that the limb be prepared in such a way that the swelling does not remain in the limb to the parts beyond with difficulty
If some days have passed since the wound has passed and it is not consolidated or is not separated from the limb, then you understand that here is the sitting of the little ones so that you can cover the wound once again. And from those sittings those which are separated remain and extrude, those which are not separated perforate you to insert them as it is possible
And if the wound is blackening or swelling, so it is putrefaction, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then you must understand that you must stop what you were doing with the treatment of which this narrative is preceded in the capital city
And in which you must stay in your place and your face must be present with your knee: when it is greatly bruised, you should examine the limb as well as the bones of the thigh and the assistant, and resemble those of the great limbs, and do not presume to move it, nor to extract it because many things would be seen to happen by that; leave it until it has healed naturally, for the pain will go away by itself within about twenty or thirty days. The pain will vanish if you take care of it, and if you do not care for it, it will remain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the treatment of a wound that has occurred in the cavity of any fracture.</start_of_turn
These veins become infected with this wound in the cavity of healing of a fracture, and more so when it is near the joints; and it is often necessary to prevent the limb from its natural movement.</start_of_turn
Then consider if the wound is recent and administer in this medicine which has stopped bleeding thus far, and behold, and heartburn, and swelling, and redness, and itching; if you perceive any of these, take some of these or all of them, and confirm that these are sufficient to stop the bleeding, or to make it white like flour, or to make it yellow like bile, and place that over the wound to stop it, and bind those over it for good restriction.</start_of_turn
And read the extraction that you must not delay that for days; and quickly extract that and repeat it until the wound is closed; or strengthen over that lamina of lead downwards, which has the property of closing everything that is swollen in the limbs.</start_of_turn
If the wound is already solidified and stretched, and it is necessary to remove it, do so cautiously, and split that for the most important part of it, and remove the excess, or take away that which appears to be pus-filled until it is closed; and care for that until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Regarding the restoration of a fracture when it has been restored and when you must take care that the limb remains limp and flexible not following its natural movement.</start_of_turn
When a bone fracture has been restored, and when you must take care that the limb remains limp and flexible, the time when it is not useful to do anything is when: the ligament and the surrounding tissue are multiple times sutured and the fracture has not healed following that; or for excess tension of the ligament to the point that the nutrition of the limb is prohibited; or for multiple excessive emboli; or for excessive movement that is not in its time; or for lack of care in the patient's body and for weakness of it.</start_of_turn
The treatment of this is to feed the patient and keep them warm until the healing has multiplied in them; administer bath; and enter with broth and let them know about it.</start_of_turn
And quickly suspend pressure over the limb, so that the pressure does not impede the circulation of nutrition, or continue to embolize it with cold water until the nutrition returns to its natural state.</start_of_turn
End of Document.</start_of_turn
Regarding the treatment of fractured bones when they have been straightened out and you must prevent them from moving from that moment on.</start_of_turn
When the limb that has already been restored is subject to strain, it must be allowed to heal in a tortuous position and with slight prominence of the fractured bone and the wound, and this to ensure the limb does not suffer from its natural movement, however, you must not prevent the limb from its natural movement as you must listen to the word of whoever exists in relation to the limb if it is newly fractured.</start_of_turn
Indeed many fools of doctors and restorers who have done this work in our time; and this operation is not to be repeated for fear of the great signal of death that comes with it.</start_of_turn
If the swelling and wound are recent, the time when it is useful to soak the limb in cold water with many medicinal herbs such as chamomile, fennel, and marjoram, or to make a plaster with plaster of Paris and lime, or to take fig seeds and massage them with olive oil or beeswax, or to take figs that are soft and bruised with the palms of the hands, and to keep those things close at hand.</start_of_turn
And some veins are dissolved with constant rubbing that is made with the greatest humidity, and it is administered with movement of the limb at all times in every hour.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is already going down naturally and is very strong and converted to stone, and it is necessary to care for it with fire, the time when it is useful to remove the pus that comes out and the continuation of the bone is dissolved, and it is indicated that excessive pus comes out from the wound of that limb to the bone that is under the skin, and that it is administered easily in that way that is requested and studied.</start_of_turn

Of sudden displacement.
Dislocation is the sudden displacement of any joint in its socket, which is prohibited from movement, and is accompanied by pain and great damage to the limb.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, when an accident of dislocation occurs, it is necessary to perforate as soon as possible to reduce it, and do not delay, for if it is delayed, the limb is swollen and the dislocation is more difficult to reduce.</end_of_turn
And to this end, do not touch or stretch the limb at the time of reduction, for the movement of the limb causes spasm and pain.</end_of_turn
When this happens, the doctor must take cover from the patient's pain and immediately place the limb under rest; and he must also embrocate the limb with cold water and oil, and reduce it with ease.</end_of_turn
And all the limb must be treated with the water from which the memory will remain in its place.</end_of_turn>
I have already given orders concerning dislocations, following the order of fractures; from the upper part of the body downwards.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XXVIII.</end_of_turn>
On the treatment of dislocations of the jawbone.</end_of_turn
So dislocated are the two mandibles if they are not immediately reduced; and the dislocation of both is frequent in two ways: either because they are rigidly fixed in their places due to little displacement, or because they are completely dislocated and complicated, until they are softened at the joint until saliva from the patient escapes and that they do not wish to open their mouth, and that their tongue is wrapped in their word.</end_of_turn
If the dislocation is slight, the limb returns by itself without great cause.</end_of_turn
If the dislocation is complete and complicated, the doctor must immediately administer reduction, and must not delay.</end_of_turn
And the minister must hold the patient's head, and the doctor must place his thumb of the hand of one hand on the root of the dislocation of the jaw outwards from the mouth, if the dislocation is of one part; or he must place both thumbs together if the dislocation is of two parts, and the others of his fingers should be held away from them; and command the patient to stop his jaws and allow those that are outside to go away from any part; and the doctor must embrace the jaw and immobilize it until it returns to its place.</end_of_turn
And if the reduction is difficult, and more so if both mandibles are simultaneously dislocated, the doctor must administer evaporation with cold water and oil, until it is possible to reduce both without further delay, as we have said.</end_of_turn
And when they return and are softened, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, the doctor should place a little powder of alum on those little hairs near the gums, and apply some wax and oil; and hold it firmly in place.</end_of_turn
And let the patient sleep on his side, with his head between two cushions, so that neither side is pressed; and do not force him to swallow violently for any reason; keep the patient's tongue tied, until when the pains are calmed and the mandibles are aligned, the doctor may allow him to drink.</end_of_turn>
And this must be administered with ease, and do not handle the opening of the mouth too roughly because of eating and drinking and spitting; until the jaw is healed and recovered.</end_of_turn
And if the reduction of two mandibles is difficult when they are simultaneously dislocated at any time and is not converted to its original place, the doctor must immediately administer fever medicine and vinegar, and is highly recommended to take an enema for the patient, and vomiting is pure anger.</end_of_turn
And when this has happened many times, the doctor must know that it is a loss; and that he will not recover that which has happened in a few days.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXV.</end_of_turn
On the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.</end_of_turn
The collarbone is not dislocated from its lateral side because of its continuity with the ribs; and some say that it is dislocated at the outer part, and that is declared by the feeling.</end_of_turn
And the reduction of it is that the patient grasps over his side and extends his upper limbs.</end_of_turn And hold the limb firmly with your palm, so that it will return.
And press down firmly on the wound and dust, and hold it steady.</end_of_turn>
May the limb regain its natural position without dislocation; for it should be reduced and bandaged as has been said before.</end_of_turn>
And hold the wound still, the dust, and the extract, and command the patient to rest calmly until they are healed.</end_of_turn
And in this way the limb is reduced when it is separated from the root of the limb.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXVI.</end_of_turn>
Of the reduction of muscle dislocation.</end_of_turn>
Know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, one of which is from the titillus to the heel.</end_of_turn
The second is that it is dislocated above the muscle, which is common; and it is not dislocated at the shoulder or at the elbow.</end_of_turn
Mostly it is dislocated downwards from the titillus, and more in those who have little flesh, readily dislocates; but in those who have much flesh, it is difficult to dislocate.</end_of_turn
And often in such cases as this, with percussion or sudden movement, the muscle is displaced from its place, and is only restored when cautery is applied to it, for it is already dislocated.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must remain until you are certain that the limb is properly set, and only then proceed with the treatment.</end>
It is known that a dislocation of the limb is when it is downwards from the titillus; so that you must distinguish between a dislocated muscle and a stretched muscle; for you will find among these variations the one where the head of the muscle is concave downwards towards the titillus as far as the touch of the thumb, and the patient is unable to reduce their hand to the root of the limb, neither can they elevate it in any way.</end>
If it is dislocated from the foot or its root, and you find this on examination, and it is not hidden.
And in this dislocation, the reduction is easier when the limb is fresh and the patient is young.</end_of_turn>
The reduction of the limb is that the minister raises the hand above the limb; and immediately place the toes under the titillus of the limb, and elevate the joint forcefully to the root of the limb, and the minister raises the hand and extends it fully; and immediately stop when it returns readily.</end_of_turn
If indeed it does not return, even from the beginning of the dislocation, for several days, then you must ensure that the patient is bathed in warm water and administered embrocations that soften and soothe as if they were coats of high-quality wool, and fennel, and meadowsweet in water, and that it is administered.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must keep the patient lying down on the thighs and resting the titillus of the limb until the swelling has subsided between elevation and tension, and the physician should place their hand over the hip and raise the head of the muscle with force, and grasp the patient's hand so that it is not bruised at the lower parts, while another minister holds the head of the patient, so that neither part is bruised at the lower parts, for both of these reasons the limb will return to its place.</end_of_turn
Or you can do it like this: have another man stand beside the patient, who is longer than the patient, and with his hand enter the limb between the titillus and the muscle of the patient and elevate the titillus to the height of the patient’s suspension in the air, while another minister pulls the patient’s hand away from the lower parts of the hip.</end_of_turn If the patient is limping, you must consider that another cause is suspended, so that it is necessary to elevate it, for the dislocation will return immediately.</end_of_turn
Or it can be reduced in this way: place on the ground a staff as long as the head of the limb, which is round like a mortar pestle, which is not thick or thin, and place your hand under the limb; since by placing the thumb over the head of the staff the limb will rest according to the length of the staff, and extend the hand of the limb on the other side; and extend the body of the limb on the other side with force, so that the joint returns to its place quickly.</end_of_turn
If reduction proves difficult on account of the above-mentioned causes, then this remedy may be used: take a fistful of the following size: two brasses in length and four fingers in width, and round the corners off slightly as follows.
And round off the top slightly so that it does not damage the patient.</end_of_turn>
And place your hand or arm over the patient's chest, and extend your hand or arm over the fist inside the limb, and bind the fist to the attendants and arms and the extremity of your hand.</end_of_turn>
And support the arm on a stool as wide as the limb, and extend your hand downwards, and the other limb should be suspended from the other side, so that the joint is supported throughout.</end_of_turn
And when the intestine has been brought back into its cavity according to any possible means, and you have covered that you suspend the pain in the chest, and apply plaster prepared from meal and ash over all the muscles, even though they are swollen, and strengthen the pain in the chest with a tight bandage; and the ligament should be twisted over the plaster, and your hand should be bound to the limb, and should be kept still, and do not move your hand for seven days.</end_of_turn>
And that the patient should abstain from food for a little while, until the limb is comfortable, because it is more conducive to recovery.</end_of_turn
And that food should be given more frequently every seven or eight days, and that exercise should be performed; and thus if it is stopped and not comforted, the patient is already healed.</end_of_turn
But if the joint is dislocated without any other cause than moisture that has happened to it, or for another reason, then it is necessary to administer cautery three times, as it is said in the chapter on cautery.</end_of_turn>
And if all this has been done and seven days have passed, and the ligament has been detached and the joint is not immobilized, and the plaster and the bandage have been reduced over it somewhat, and it is not immobilized and is relaxed and cannot be raised above the level of the limb, then you know that the nerves of the limb, which are at the head of the muscle, are already insensitive or extended or softened, and that the joint will never be fixed in place again.</end_of_turn
In the dislocation of that which is useful, you must support the foot and the ankle or the back parts, and reduce with impulse and extension as much as possible, until it returns.</end_of_turn
And administer in the other way, and take care that it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if it happens that the recovery is slow in the limb and there is delay in its movement, then the patient should use cold packs until that gravity is relieved and it returns to its natural state.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXVII.</end_of_turn>
On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.</end_of_turn>
You know that the ankle joint is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; and that which is dislocated throughout the limb, and especially from the front to the back, and the dislocation of the limb is not suspected until it is grasped because it is concealed by the skin or by some other figure which is displaced, and when the ankle joint is displaced, even if it is slight, that the joint is flattened and cannot bend the limb, or touch any of the muscles.</end_of_turn
And that you must support the ankle bones and reduce the dislocation as much as possible until it returns to its place after the cautery has been performed, for if you see it after the cautery has been performed, it is difficult to reduce it, and it will not be completely healed; and this is especially true if it is from the back of the limb, for it is worse of all the other kinds of dislocation, and it causes more pain, and many wounds must be made on that account.</end_of_turn
And the restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that you extend your hand towards the two fingers, expand your arms, and place the hands of the doctor over the ankle and under it, and the plaster should cover the joint with the nails of the thumb or at the root of the palm until it returns to its place.</end_of_turn
And if the dislocation is from the front, you must return it as soon as possible even if you perforate the ankle with the palm of your hand.</end_of_turn
And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, you must administer violent extension and force.</end_of_turn
Two assistants extend their arms, and hold the patient's eyes two assistants to prevent them from blinking during the extension.
And now rotate the arms throughout their extent, because they are enveloped with a doubled layer of membrane on the hand side, or ligament.</end_of_turn>
When the doctor touches the joint with his hand, apply some oil so that these causes may be alleviated which facilitate lubrication of the joint; and then gently push the joint inward until it returns.</end_of_turn
Then reduce it carefully, covering it with a compress which has styptic properties and exudates albumin from the urine, and remove it with great caution, suspending the arm from the collar and letting it rest for a few days.</end_of_turn>
Then remove the dressing; and therefore if the joint is formed in the heel, then tear the ligament of the heel and leave it like that.</end_of_turn
If the joint is not to be stretched, then repeat the packing and the ligament, and leave it like that for a few days until it is removed; then remove that.</end_of_turn
If, however, the accident has caused the joint to gravitate towards the reduction of the joint, and the disposition is in movement, then administer moisture in abundance and fine powder, and support, until the swelling subsides; or rest over the joint without movement, so that there is no fatty swelling; and then bind it, and leave it like that during the day and night.</end_of_turn And so on with the others, put him in the bath; and when the swelling subsides, then gently massage the joint with temperate friction, and then repeat the above three times, so that it is harmonious with movement, once, twice, and thrice.</end_of_turn Corruption has already reached the marrow inside the bone, until it is delimited.</end_of_turn>
And if you wish, rest over that wound of the moist and scaly cow over the edge and stretch over that; and do a few compressions, so that that which is moist will reduce to its disposition.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXVIII.</end_of_turn>
Of the care of dislocation of the limb, that is between the arm and the hand.</end_of_turn
The dislocation of the hand many times is violent, and the reduction of the dislocation is light, and the opposite is true of the other joints, however it must be known that the limb must not be fractured or that an injury has occurred in the fracture.
The reduction of the dislocation of the limb is that you rest the limb of the patient on a table and the doctor extends the limb, and the doctor places his hand or palm over the vicinity of the joint, and gently pushes that until it returns to its proper place.</end_of_turn
However it must be considered if the palm already rests on the belly of the hand, then the patient must rest his two hands on a table during the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is previous, then two hands must be placed over the hand, so that the doctor’s hand grasps that vicinity of the joint.</end_of_turn
And so if it returns quickly, that is good; and if not, then gently stretch that with the dressing away giving up the fracture; and do not repeat that until it has passed over the reduction.</end_of_turn
However the joint must remain according to its flexibility; and do not notice to the patient any cause, but that the hand is softened and cannot stretch any cause; for it is known that the nerves are torn or severed, and that it is not strained in it except that it is stretched with a pointed instrument at the time of treatment for the cause.</end_of_turn
When the limb is returned, then rest over it the dressing which has been recommended, and leave it bound and stretched for five days; and then remove the dressing and leave it loose and exercise the limb.</end_of_turn
However if the movement of the limb is slight and the accident has occurred in it any gravity, then gently stretch that with lukewarm water and perform a few compressions, until the swelling is alleviated.</end_of_turn

Of the care of dislocation of the fingers.</end_of_turn
Some fingers are dislocated throughout their extent.</end_of_turn
And when any finger of those at the base or on the belly of the hand is dislocated, then gently hold the finger and push the dislocation back with the thumbs, until it returns.</end_of_turn
Then support the head of the digit, suspend that which is displaced to the part where it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Then suspend that and extend that until it is equal in that limb today
And when night comes, bind that according to that narration, and do not cease loosening that until the day, and exercise with movement, and bind that at night; do that for several days until it is healed
Do the same with that which is at the belly of the hand, and bind that to that part and do that with the first operation, until it is healed
Do the same with that which is dislocated in the other parts

Of the treatment of dislocation of the spondyls of the two.
When an accident occurs to any of the spondyls of the two or the neck dislocation complete, and so remain without movement of the spondyls in their places, in that case there is no treatment, for death covers the patient.
And the sign of that is that the evacuation of the patient is outside of his will, and cannot be retained; and most people consider it to be mollifying some limb of him or two veins of him, or two bones of him, or that one of them has become loose; or that one of the spondyls has become loose from its place, for most people consider that to be loose and that to make it solid is to remove those from four parts
Therefore that which is already loose at the back is called gelinosity
May the treatment of them be that you consider if the gelinosity happened in infancy, for in that case neither treatment nor healing of any kind is possible
May in that in which you see by chance or by percussion or by suspicion, already said the ancients the ways of treatment which are lengthy, of which the most part returns to profit; may I already have abbreviated that of which little is said for the excess of it, for my nearness to your understanding exposes me to your suspicion, to which I have exposed myself and formed with various instruments of that of which I shall show you and explain that one.
And that one is cured only when it happens in the two things themselves as I recommend
And that the patient be extended over his face over the edge of the bed, and be extended so that his limbs are not hindered by the pressure of his feet
And put a bottle filled with water that is closed at the top, placed on the ground under the head of the limb, and another bottle in the vicinity of the feet of the limb on the other side
The minister has the bottle, and do not stop it in a fossa; and another minister has the other in that way
And put a bandage around the head of the patient and leave them tight enough to make them feel a little tight; and extend the limb to the bottle which is to the head of the limb, and bind that to it; and do the same with the other limb around the ankles of the limb to the front of the limb, and bind those to the bones of the limb; and adjust all the bands and bind those to the other bottle which is to the feet of the limb.
And the minister grasps outside and extends the limb to the part of the bottle, and do not let the two bottles and the bands of the limbs in the places where they are placed be loosened, however, do not stop them as we have said
And the doctor places his palms on the spondyle with strength until it returns, or that he places over that a table, and that he adjusts over the table the feet of the limb until it returns
May it not return in this way, the hour takes a table from which the width or the length is in the vicinity of three bones, and digs into the wall from which we have said that it is in front of the patient a place in which the limb is between the two parts of the table And put the heel of the table on the spondyle, the doctor puts the feet of the limb on the other side, and lifts up until the spondyle is contracted and returns to its place
And if you want, or if it is twisted with the hand; and that you stay on the ground with the head of the patient behind the heel of the two bottles, the length of which is that of an arm, and put the head of the limb behind the heel of the limb at a distance of two fists; and that the length which is between each bottle is a palm, and that is enough in any fist where the turn returns, and that no part be fixed in the ground so that it is not crushed.
And let there be a round distension in the belly where the turning point is, and let it be rotated in the two incisions of the two bellies.
And at the extremity of the belly is an incision in which the belly is formed, the length of which is equal to one palm beyond that which is rotated; and in the two other bellies it is similar to this.</end_of_turn>
And now stretch the ligaments which you have stretched in the patient's thighs in the part towards the head of the thigh, and the ligaments which you have stretched in the space between the thighs in the part towards the feet of the thigh.</end_of_turn>
And now you must make each incision and let a minister hold the incision with his hand, and the doctor should grasp the spinous process according to what has been said.</end_of_turn
And when the spinous process has been returned, and the limb has been sutured, then cover that you have stopped with an ointment of alum, and stop; and place your hand over the ointment so that the intestine does not come out. The size of the bandage should be three fingers or thereabouts, and its length should be as much as to cover the area of the swelling, and over the part of the spinous process itself.</end_of_turn
And do the same with the ligament which we mentioned before, and use the patient's food sparingly until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
And if there remains any swelling in the limb at the end of the healing, then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and soothe the swelling with the administration of alum, which we have recommended; and it is administered in that area by a piece of lead.</end_of_turn
There are many other affections that accompany these swellings at the back of the spines of both [feet?], and they are cured by that dislocation; and that is the bone which has already mentioned that must not be allowed to suffer any further injury by this medicine, for that would cause your death.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXXII.</end_turn>
On the treatment of a dislocated ankle.</end_turn>
Know that the ankle joint and the muscle joint do not suffer anything else but dislocation alone, and not from any other affections that affect the other joints of the little toe that are removed and flattened.</end_of_turn
And the ankle joint is dislocated in four ways, that is, at the front, or at the back, or at the top, or at the bottom.</end_of_turn
And most often it is dislocated at the front, and little at the top or at the bottom.</end_of_turn
And a sign of the dislocation of the ankle at the front is that, when you adjust the bandage of the healthy limb with the limb that is being treated, the thumb is longer and more prominent than the healthy one, and the limb cannot bend its knee over the ankle without causing pain, and the limb is stretched out as far as the heel has been moved forward by the cautery.</end>
The sign of that to which this affection relates is that these [afflictions] happen in the opposite way to this one.</end_of_turn
The sign of that to which this affection relates is that the limb is expanded towards the front according to custom, more especially not bending the knee that causes pain in that area; and if you perforate it to go forward and it cannot go over what is in front, the urine is retained and the swelling is post-traumatic, and you must walk the limb on the ankle.</end_of_turn
The sign of that to which this affection relates is that it does not expand the ankle, nor does it permit bending that knee which bends the swelling, and the bandage of the limb is shorter than the other, and the swelling is softened, and the heel is over that place.</end_of_turn
More reduction of these species of dislocation is that you consider, when you know if the dislocation is old and ancient, for it is already outdated as soon as you have administered reduction to it and it remains according to its custom; for in that treatment there is no need for that.</end_of_turn
More in that one in which the dislocation is recent, and is one of the four species of dislocation, then you must command that you return the joint and extend it towards the front and towards the back, and also towards the right and left, for that is what is most likely to restore it and not to cause any other treatment.</end_of_turn
More so, if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare strong ministers and extend the bandage of the limb from the lower part, or from the upper part, or from the ligament which is bound about the ankle; and another minister should extend his hand of that side that puts his thumbs on the toes of the limb; and you must strengthen the ankle ligament over the heel of the foot, and have another minister hold the limb.</end_of_turn
And let the extension be from the hip joint to the ankle joint, or from the buttock to the knee joint.
And let the extension be throughout so that the patient's body rests on the earth and remains hanging down.</end_of_turn>
And this kind of extension is common in all four limbs.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, if the dislocation returns to where we have said, it is well; but if not, it is necessary to do everything according to the proper treatment.</end_of_turn>
In the reduction itself, when it is dislocated, if the dislocation is at the hip joint, cover that the patient's body rests on the side of the bed; and place your hand over the base of the thigh in that place where between the head of the thigh and the place that is left hanging is the ankle joint.
And another servant grasps firmly the patient's arms, and immediately grasp the large area of the painful thigh and extend outwards by strong extension, until that which returned to its place.</end_of_turn>
And this is the lighter treatment of the member that is reduced compared to the others.</end_of_turn>
More than if you excuse yourself and do not obey the order with this kind of treatment, it is necessary that both feet of the patient be held firmly together with strong bands, with love, over both the ankles and over both the toes.</end_of_turn>
And let the length of each by the quantity of four fingers, and let the painful limb be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.</end_of_turn
And let the patient be suspended over the head of the bed, and that he be in the middle; and let the length of the limb from the earth be the quantity of two arms.</end_of_turn
And let a strong youth grasp the head of the thigh and suspend it with the patient, and the other youth grasp the thigh with force pushing, so that the joint returns to its place quickly.</end_of_turn
But in the reduction itself, when the dislocation is outwards, cover that the patient steps over the heel as we have recommended; and keep the ligament stretched over the painful limb and over the feet of the patient.</end_of_turn
And two cushions are placed, one under the foot, and the other under the head; and two cushions are placed adjusted to the middle of the limb that is left hanging over which a damp cloth is placed, so that the patient is not wet because the limb is between the thighs, so that the extension to the outwards parts is not strained.</end_of_turn>
And let every attendant extend their part, and the doctor with his hand grasps the reduction according to the art.</end_of_turn
And when the dislocation is at the knee joint, it is necessary that the limb be flexed strongly; and as for the thigh, it is like what is said above about the limb; and the doctor places the palm of his right hand over the painful knee, and with his left hand grasps that which is grasped by the right hand, and over that grasp pauses that which is extended to the outwards parts of the foot.</end_of_turn
And if the dislocation is at the hip joint, it is not necessary that the patient's limb be extended to the outwards parts, but rather elevated over the earth; and it is necessary to keep it fixed firmly, just as if the ankle were dislocated outwards, as we have said about the support of the limb over two fingers; and it is over its face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, without any spasm.</end_of_turn
And cover that a bandage is administered over the area around the joint.</end_of_turn
Therefore when the reduction is accomplished as we have said – and the sign of the reduction of the limb is not hidden from you, that is that you extend the limb in two positions, and when you have done those things and the limb is released from its embrace and expands its limb and expands that sensation of excuse, you will know that the limb according to what we have said is returned – and you adjust two cushions and place them under and extend with a bandage so that the ankle does not swell in any of the parts; and keep the patient at rest for three days or for four.</end_of_turn
And then remove the ligament and the membrane, and compare one limb with the other.
When, however, you see that the swelling has subsided, then know that the dislocation has already stopped, and now let the patient rest.
And if you see any cause of malnutrition, then return it and plaster that [limb], and extract that according to your first order, and leave that one for three days.
Then remove that [limb], and make that walk slowly for a few days, until he is comforted.
Chapter XXXII.
On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle bone
The ankle bone is dislocated in three ways, that is, it is dislocated at the outer part, and at the inner part, and at the lower part towards the heel; but not at the upper part.
And the sign of dislocation is that the patient complains that his limb is bent at the ankle; know that the ankle is dislocated
And the restoration of all these ways is that you must make the patient sit upright, without bending his limb, until he can extend his limb voluntarily; apply two bands to the front of the limb, and place his foot between the ankles; and further apply two bands to hold the ankle to the heel, and another to extend the limb until the ankle returns to its place.
And the sign of recovery is that his limb adheres to the ground without labor without lifting it off the ground
Then plaster that limb and make him adhere the bandage to the ground, and keep them bound together with a bandage for three days or four, and then remove them.
Do not let the patient walk for a few days, until he is healed and comforted
Moreover, if the reduction was done by you, know that it is excused, however, administer strong extension to the ligaments of which in the treatment of the ankle was previously narrated
Chapter XXXIII.</start_of_turn>
On the treatment of dislocation of the talus bone
The talus bone is sometimes dislocated for slight displacement, and sometimes it is dislocated according to custom, and the dislocation is caused either by the outer part or the inner part or the heel part
The sign of dislocation is that sometimes the talus becomes flat as a result of the displacement to which it is dislocated.
As for the treatment of displacement, it is of little remedy, and it is that it is extended easily with ease and is swollen until it returns to its place
As for the treatment of dislocation according to custom, command the patient to sit upright, and hold that limb by the heel with a strong and valiant hand in the middle of the limb's place
And put your right hand on the top of the foot and your left hand on the lower part of the foot in the place of the ankle
And pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and with the left hand for two thumbs, and extend with the left hand; and bind the ankle to the heel with the bandage that will be on the right side of the bandage
And do two thumbs as we have counted
And bind the foot to the bandage for the third time, and you are at the ankle
Therefore, if it returns in one thumb or two according to this manner, and if sometimes the foot is swollen, it is good; but if not, know that you must repeat the operation until it returns
Moreover, if it is prohibited for you to reduce it in this way, know that you must make the patient walk on his two legs on the ground, and support him with a cushion under his thighs, and place a cushion under his feet, and you have already placed a bandage around his limb for the sake of preventing him from being injured
And let the attendant hold the patient's thighs, and another extend the limb with his hands or with the ligaments that lie over the ankle; and extend whichever minister you like against the extension of the limb, and the cushion should remain between the patient's thighs so that the body of the limb is not pulled towards the lower parts because of the extension
And the physician should bandage the dislocation with the heels, and another minister should hold the healthy ankle towards the lower parts, so that the dislocation returns with ease.
Therefore, when the dislocation has been reduced and you have declared the restoration of the limb, then you pause the plaster and gently stretch out the part that was tightly limed, and join the limb to the bandage.
Beware or take precautions against the nerves that lie behind the knee, so that the ligament over that area is not too tight and the part is not injured too much.
And keep it elevated for two or three days; and if the ligament is softened, remove it
And on the fourth day or the fifth, remove the dressing and prohibit the patient from eating for forty days. Even if it is necessary to go forward despite this space, it is not harmful to ensure that the dislocation is not dissolved and corrupted, and that you do not cause further damage.</start_of_turn>
And if the limb is accidentally burned by the cautery, cover that immediately with the salve that we mentioned before in this narration, in another place of care and bandage, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XXXIV.</start_of_turn>
On the treatment of dislocations of the toes.</start_of_turn
When something is dislocated, keep it gently stretched without excessive force; and what is not difficult, abstain from it.</start_of_turn
If the dislocation is on the ankle bones of the foot, then make the patient sit with their foot resting on the ground or a table, and stay like this as if they were going.</start_of_turn
Then hold your foot still, and keep the limb resting on what is above the joints, and support the limb with your hand until it returns, and that you see that it is already healed and does not appear in the area immediately.</start_of_turn
And put under the foot of the limb a board that covers the whole foot, which has two caps, and support the limb downwards with your hand for three days; and then remove it and allow the patient to walk for a month, until it is healed and the restoration is certain.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXXV.</start_of_turn
Of the kinds of dislocations that are caused by swelling or fracture or some other injury.</start_of_turn
When any of these causes occur, and you proceed with the treatment and restoration of the limb, the patient often dies.</start_of_turn
Therefore, do not presume that you can cure this without knowledge, experience, compassion and humility; and use in the beginning of treatment medicines that do not cause burns so much alone, and consult the divine judge, rather than to him who promises you salvation, both from the disease and from the loss, in whom any hope appears.</start_of_turn Therefore, strive in the first place to reduce the dislocation in the beginning of the disease, without causing further damage.</start_of_turn
And if the limb returns as we want, then administer a regimen that relieves the swelling and dries out the wound.</start_of_turn
If the dislocation is on a separated tibia, then you puncture the membrane of the joint, and do what has been said in the simple diseases of this kind.</start_of_turn
Beware and avoid according to your ability what is in the way of fear according as I have foretold; for what is better for you than the Creator Himself? May His permanent glory be praised, and may you enjoy true peace in this life and in the next.</start_of_turn Thus ends the discourse of Albucasim, perfectly blessed by God. Amen.</start_of_turn>
