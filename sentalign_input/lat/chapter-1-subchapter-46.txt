On the method of cauterizing for pains caused by a fall or blow.
Chapter 48.
When pain occurs in certain limbs from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is ineffective: then it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery.
And the cautery for each limb should be sized according to its size, and its delicacy, weakness, strength, and the location of the twist and pain from it.
If it heals from the first cauterization, it is well.
If not, then repeat the cauterization.
Because it is customary with these pains that they shift from one limb to another nearby.
Therefore you should pursue them with cauterization until the patient is healed.
