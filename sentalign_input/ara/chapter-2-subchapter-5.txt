Chapter Five.
On the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from inside the head.
When someone experiences copious, sharp, pungent, and persistent discharges, and you see their eyes weakened and small, their vision impaired, their eyelids ulcerated, and their eyelashes falling out.
And there is a sharp, painful ache deep in the head, and continuous sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from numerous, deep vessels, and the best treatment for them is this treatment:  You order the patient to shave his forehead, then you make a single incision in the middle of the forehead.
Or slightly higher horizontally, and you begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and the incision should reach the bone. Keep your hand away from the temple muscles that move during chewing until the bone is exposed and you have dried all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the edges of the incision with absorbent cotton or a linen wick, then bandage over it with compresses soaked in wine and oil to prevent a hot swelling. When you remove the bandage and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should scrape the bone until the flesh begins to grow in it.
Then treat it with the drying method that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony, preparing an ointment from them, and using it for flesh growth in such wounds.
