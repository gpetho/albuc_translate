Sometimes fingers are dislocated in various directions.	The fingers may be dislocated in any direction.	0.7564264
When a finger is dislocated towards the back or the palm, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.	When one of the fingers is dislocated dorsally or ventrally, then extend the finger and thrust the dislocation with your thumb until it goes back.	0.91034174
Then support the finger tip and suspend it towards the dislocated direction, leaving it for two days.	Then bind the head of the phalanx, suspending it in the direction in which it was dislocated, and leave it for two days.	0.7819646
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straightened on that same day.	Then unbind it and extend it so that it may straighten out all that day.	0.821988
At night, bandage it as described, and during the day, unwrap and exercise it, rebandaging it at night; do this for several days until it is stable.	Then at nightfall bind it in just the same way.
