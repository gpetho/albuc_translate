of the hip	at the hip].	0.5231476
When viscous moisture descends to the hip joint, causing it to dislocate, and the sign is that one thigh is longer than the other when measured together; and the location of the dislocation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient on the hip joint with a circular cautery, and bleed in front of the location around the joint so that the joint is within the circle; and let the cautery be like the one used for the stomach.	Then you should cauterize the patient over the hip joint itself with a circular burn, after you have marked with ink a circle round the femoral joint, so that the joint falls in the middle of the circle. The cautery should be the one whose description has already been given in cauterization of the stomach.	0.6220058
And if this cautery is not available, make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and let the cautery be as deep as the entire core; and treat it until it is healed.	But if you have not this cautery by you, give him three cauterizations with the larger size olivary cautery. The burn should be to the depth of the whole thickness of the skin. Then dress till healed.	0.7607561
