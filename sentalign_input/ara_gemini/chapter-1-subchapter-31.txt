Chapter thirty-one on cauterizing ascites.
Cauterization is only beneficial in particular for ascites due to an obstruction.
If you treat the patient with ascites with the types of treatment that we mentioned in the classification, and your treatment is not effective, then it is appropriate to cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel, one cauterization on the stomach, another cauterization on the liver, a cauterization on the spleen, and two cauterizations behind his back between the vertebrae, one facing his chest and the other facing his stomach.
And the depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then you leave the cauterization open, letting the pus flow for a long time.
And do not neglect treating the patient after the cauterization with what is appropriate to combine for him the two meanings, so that healing will quickly come to him.
And the shape of the cautery iron with which the back is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its image was presented previously, and the one with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped.
