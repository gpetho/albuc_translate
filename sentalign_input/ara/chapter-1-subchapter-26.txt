Chapter Twenty-Six.
On cauterizing the stomach.
If there occurs in the stomach coldness and much moisture, so that it puts it out of its temperament, and the discharges to it increase, and it is treated with various kinds of treatment but it does not succeed, then the patient should lie on his back and extend his legs and arms, then you should cauterize him with three cauterizations.
One cauterization below the xiphoid process the width of a finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauterizations below, on the sides of the single cauterization, so that the shape of the cauterizations is like a triangle, and further apart so that they do not join when they suppurate, and the depth of the cautery should be two-thirds of the thickness of the skin, and the shape of the cauterizations should be...
like this image, and this size, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach like this image.
And the cautery iron with which you cauterize this single cauterization should be in the shape of a circle like this image.
And the stomach may be cauterized by spotting, for one who shrinks from this cauterization, which is that you mark points on the stomach to the extent that you desire with ink, then cauterize it with a spotting cautery, then treat it with the aforementioned treatment until it heals.
