Chapter XIII.	CHAPTER TWELVE.	0.61586666
When signs of fluid accumulation in the eye become evident, as discussed in the disease divisions, begin by giving the patient something that will purify the head.	When by those signs I have mentioned in the relevant section there is brought to your notice the beginning of a cataract of the eye, start with draughts for the patient such as shall cleanse his head; and guard him from all humidities.	0.70251036
Keep the patient away from all sources of moisture, and have him sit in a steam bath while fasting for several days.	Make him also sweat for some days, fasting, in the bath.	0.49804538
Then instruct him to shave his head, and apply a cautery to the middle of the head. Next, cauterize both temples if the fluid is affecting both eyes or on one side if it is in one eye, severing all veins and arteries under the skin with the cautery. These cauteries should extend along the temples' width; take care to avoid excessive blood flow.	Then tell him to have his head shaved; and burn him with one cauterization in the middle of the head; then cauterize him with two burns on the temples if the cataract is beginning in both eyes; or on the one side only if it is in one eye. And with the cautery cut all the subcutaneous veins and arteries; and let the cauterizations be long, across the breadth of the temples.	0.82147765
If bleeding is observed, immediately cut it off with whatever means possible. I will elaborate further on artery extraction and cutting and ways to prevent excessive blood flow.	Beware of haemorrhage; if you see any, stanch it straight away with any means you can. We shall deal later on with the method of extraction and cutting out of arteries, and provision against haemorrhage.	0.8284039
In some cases, two cauteries should be applied at the back of the neck, beneath the two bones, as a final step.	Two strong cauterizations are sometimes made on the back of the neck below the two bones.	0.7596546
