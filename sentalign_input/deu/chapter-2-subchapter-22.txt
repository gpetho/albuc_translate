Chapter XXII.
On the treatment of alconati.
This disease called alconati is not anything but a fluid which is attached in the eye resembling descending water, but it is not that.
The way to treat it is to make the patient sit on a prepared and upright seat, then take his head in your hands on both sides and move it until you see the fluid come to the lower parts, and it dries and does not descend, and the vision is clear, and the patient sees things as before.
If it does not descend, you know it is water.
If the descent is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and take a fine instrument and make a small incision on the panniculus towards the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the circle (in the empty place), until the fluid is expelled.
Then when it is expelled, you drip warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled.
Then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
