Chapter Twenty-Nine:
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that the cautery made from the roots of aristologia for cold pleurisy is done in this way: take a long dry root of aristologia that is found and is the thickness of a finger.
Then submerge it in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize with one cautery in the place between the continuation of the furcula (collarbone) and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the clavicles, slightly inclined to the area below the chin, and with two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined to the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and another on the stomach, and three cauteries on the back; and one cautery in the place between the two shoulders, and two cauteries on both sides of the chest, below the cautery between the two shoulders.
And it is not necessary to press too much with the cautery, but it should be evident in the tendon during the procedure.
Some ancients also said that some people use a cautery of iron similar to a rod and heat it, placing it in the location between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess and pus is expelled, as we have said for the liver abscess.
But in this perforation with cautery, there is no fear, because one can die immediately or it can cause a fistula that cannot be healed.
