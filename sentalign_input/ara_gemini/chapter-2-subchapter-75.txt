Chapter seventy-fifth in teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses if they come out in an unnatural form.
The midwife should first know the form of a natural birth, and its signs are: if you see the woman pushing downwards and longing to smell the air, and her labor pains become easier for her, and the exit of the fetus is quick, then know that this birth will be in the natural form, and its exit will be headfirst, and the placenta with it or hanging from its umbilical cord.
So if you see these signs, it is appropriate to press her abdomen so that the fetus comes out quickly, because if it descends headfirst, the placenta descends with it and she cleanses well from those excesses.
And other than this birth, it is unnatural and undesirable because the fetus may come out on its feet, or its hands may come out before its head and feet, or one hand or one foot may come out, or its head and hand may come out, or it may come out folded, and perhaps it turns on its back, and similar undesirable forms.
So it is appropriate for the midwife to be skillful and gentle in all these things and to beware of slips and errors, and I am explaining each form of them and the proper technique for it so that you may be guided by that and understand it.
If the fetus comes out headfirst, the natural exit, and that is difficult for the woman, and labor is difficult for her, and you see that her strength has weakened, then sit her on a chair and order women to hold her, and apply a poultice to her uterus with cooked fenugreek and moist ointments.
Then the midwife inserts a small lancet between her fingers and cuts the placenta with it or cuts it with her fingernail until the moisture in it flows out, and presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then it is appropriate to inject the woman with fenugreek mucilage with oil of euphorbia, then after the injection, order her to push and make her sneeze with hellebore and hold her mouth and nose, for the fetus will come out immediately.
If the fetus's hand comes out first, it is appropriate to push them back gently little by little, if they do not go in, then place the woman on a platform and raise her legs upwards, then shake the platform on the ground and the woman holds on so that she does not fall when shaking, if the hands do not go in and the fetus dies, then cut them off and pull the rest of the fetus or tie its hands with a cloth and pull them moderately, for it will come out.
Exit of the fetus on its feet.
If the fetus comes out on its feet, it is appropriate to push them upwards, then turn the fetus little by little until you straighten it, then take one of its legs and extend it little by little, and if they come out to the thighs, then order her to push and make her sneeze with hellebore, for it will come out.
If it does not come out as we described, then return the fetus little by little until you put it in the natural form, then it will come out smoothly.
If it resists with all that we described, then take marshmallow mucilage, fenugreek mucilage, oil of euphorbia, and dissolved gum, and grind all of them in a mortar well, then anoint with it the woman's vulva and lower abdomen, then sit her in lukewarm water until it reaches the thighs.
So if you see that her lower part has softened, then make for her a suppository of myrrh and let her bear it, and if she holds the suppository for an hour, then sit her on the chair, then make her sneeze and close her mouth and nose, and gently press her lower abdomen, for the fetus will come out immediately.
Exit of the fetus on its knees and hands.
If it comes out in this manner, strive to insert its hands little by little, then the woman lies on her back and hangs her hips downwards while lying on a bed and clasps her hands, then press above her abdomen little by little, then remove what is under her legs from the pillows until her lower part is elevated, if the fetus does not come out, then take both of her legs and move them vigorously, then press above the thighs little by little until the fetus ascends upwards, then the midwife inserts her hand and straightens the fetus little by little and orders the woman to push until the fetus comes out.
Exit of the fetus transversely, hanging one of its hands.
Strive to return its hand, if you are unable to return it, then make the woman stand and make her walk, if she is unable to walk, then let her lie on her bed and shake her legs vigorously, then use the poultice that I described from the mucilages, if labor pains take her, then sit her on a chair, then work on returning the hand and straightening the fetus to the natural form, and make the woman sneeze and order her to push until it comes out.
Exit of the fetus on its back, extending its hands, and its face is towards its mother's back.
It is appropriate for the midwife to hold the fetus's hand, then turn it little by little and straighten it gently, and when it is straightened, apply to her vulva what we described of ointment and mucilages, then order her to move little by little, and if she does that, then sit her on the chair and order her to lean to the right side, then order her to push and make her sneeze with hellebore, for it will come out.
Exit of the fetus upright on its side.
If it descends to the cervix in this manner with the placenta, then cut the placenta with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture, and if it is attached to the fetus's face and neck, cut it from the umbilical cord so that it does not choke and die, then push the fetus inwards until you put it as it should be, and order the woman to push several times, for it will come out easily.
Exit of twins or many fetuses.
Know that twins are often born, and three or four may be born and live, except that is rare, as for five, it is something outside of nature, they do not live at all.
And one placenta surrounds them, even if they are many, and they are separated by a dividing membrane between them connected to the umbilical cord of each one of them.
And they may come out as a single fetus comes out, a natural, easy exit, and they may come out in an undesirable exit as we described, so if some of them have difficulty at birth and become in what we mentioned of unnatural forms, then treat it as we described.
And let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and patience, and use strategies for each form with what is available to her of techniques leading to safety.
Mention of what is conceived in the uterus of fetuses and then they are miscarried.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the uterus, and it has been confirmed to me that a woman miscarried seven and another fifteen, all of them conceived, that is by the decree of the Mighty, the Knowing.
So all of this should be in the knowledge of the midwife, perhaps something like that will happen to her one day, so she addresses it as appropriate.
