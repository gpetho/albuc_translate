of the dead child
When you treat a woman with a dead child in the womb, as I have said in the section, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to work by hand; you must know if the woman is of sound constitution, and does not have an illness where she fears death; the woman must be placed on her back, with her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised; and the assistant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled down with the descent of the child; then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mucilage of marshmallow and fenugreek and linseed, then let the midwife anoint her hands with these oils and these mucilages; then insert them gently into the womb, then find a place where she can insert the hooks that are suitable for this, and pay attention if the child is positioned to descend head first; insert the hooks into its eyes or its neck or its mouth or its palate or under the chin or in the fontanelle or near the temples, and if the descent is feet first, insert them in the heel and in the middle ribs; and she must hold the hook in her right hand, and place the curvature between the fingers of her left hand, and insert it with her whole hand gently, and insert the hook in any of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space; and this is the shape of the hook:
then insert another hook against it, or a third if you need it, so that the extraction is even; and then pull evenly, moving from one side to the other, to make it come out, and the hook should be toothed to hold it, as is the shape here:
And if a part remains, let the midwife anoint some of her fingers with oil, and insert them into that part, and pull the other part; and if any of it remains, put this hook in a higher place, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and it cannot be brought back due to the tightness, you must wrap it in a cloth, until it comes out completely; then cut it at the joint of the wrist or at the elbow, and so you must do with the other hand, and with both feet.
And if the child's head is large and it is narrow at the exit, or if there is fluid collected in the head, you must insert the thorny spatula between your fingers, and pierce the head and extract the fluid; or you break it with the instrument that is called "almidach," whose form comes with the instruments in the chapter that is after this one; and do the same if the child has a naturally large head; and then pull out the bones with forceps, and if the head jumps out and is constricted at the fontanelle, let it be split, so that the moisture that is in the brain comes out; and if it cannot come out, cut it in pieces however you can; and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, you must pierce it so that the fluid runs out.
And if the child is on its feet, the extraction is easy, and the straightening at the opening of the womb is easy.
And if it is narrow at the belly or the chest, you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around the hand; and pierce the belly or the chest, so that the moisture that is there runs out; and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, let the midwife put her hand deep into the womb, and pull it down to the opening of the womb; then insert one or two hooks there, and pull it out; and if the opening of the womb is narrowed due to a hot abscess that has come there, you should not work on it, but rather administer moist and fatty things; and administer poultices to her, and sitz baths in softening and moisturizing water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can straighten it, administer what we have said for the live child; and if one cannot, then pull it out piece by piece, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, administer what we have said for hot abscesses that occur in the womb; and if bleeding occurs, she should be placed in constricting water, and other treatments administered.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had died, then another was conceived over that one, and the other died as well.
After a long time, she developed an abscess in the buttock, and it swelled so much that it opened, and began to suppurate heavily.
I was called to treat it, and I worked on it for a long time, and the wound would not close.
I applied a plaster with strong drawing power, and a bone came out, and after a few days, another one.
I was very surprised, because there are no bones in the belly.
So I thought that these were the bones of a dead child.
I examined the wound, and drew out many bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived for a long time like this, and a little pus always came out of the place; and I have only recorded this chapter so that, when a physician finds a strange case, they might know how to offer help.
