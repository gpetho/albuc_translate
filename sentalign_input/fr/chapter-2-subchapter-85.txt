Regarding the rupture of the abdomen
The rupture of the abdomen can be large, medium, or small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines or the nerves of the intestines protrude, causing their prolapse;
and the stitching is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one,
because it is harder to put the intestines back in, unless done immediately;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel cold, making it harder to return them,
and this is why the medium wound is often better, because the intestines are easier to reposition than in the other two.
And know that the rupture of the abdomen can occur in four ways:
the two common stitches happen in the sewing of the abdomen,
and the stitching of other body wounds and two other specific stitches are common for other wounds;
yet they are more appropriate for the stitching of the abdomen, and I will describe each and explain.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine protrudes,
and it is difficult to put it back, it is due to one of two reasons:
either because of the small size of the wound, as we have said,
or because the intestine is swollen due to the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this way:
wet a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water,
or you boil squinant (wormwood), cypress, and spike (lavender) in water,
and pour it over the intestine until the swelling is reduced;
and sometimes restraining wines are used, which are better than plain water for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling subside, moisten the intestine with water where althea (marshmallow) and mallows have been boiled,
because this eases the reinsertion a little;
and if it cannot enter, slightly enlarge the wound with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting,
as no one should cut without great necessity;
and this is the instrument for the incision:
it cuts inside the curve but not outside, and here is the shape:
And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes,
put it back according to its natural shape in its proper place,
if you can, because it is very beneficial.
When the wound is large, and it is on the lower part of the abdomen,
it is necessary to make the patient lie on their back,
and place their legs higher than their head;
and if it is on the lower part of the abdomen,
then place the head and chest higher than the lower parts,
and similarly if the rupture of the abdomen is in one of the two parts
pay attention to make the injured part higher than the other;
and thus manage what I say for large and medium wounds.
In small wounds apply what you have prepared,
then have a compassionate assistant who holds the whole rupture in his hand,
and bring the edges together;
and this is the common method of stitching,
and it is that you take a needle or several, according to the size of the wound,
then leave a finger's width from the edge of the wound, and insert a needle with a strong thread;
and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the membrane (siphac),
which is under the skin, so that you pierce it on that side,
and bring together the two edges of the siphac;
then tie a double thread around the needle from both sides,
then bring the two edges of the wound neatly together,
and then leave a finger's width and insert another needle;
then tie it with the thread as you did with the first needle,
and continue doing this as necessary with the needles,
until the whole wound is closed;
and the needles should be medium-sized, between fine and thick,
because fine needles cut all the flesh, and too thick needles cannot enter well:
therefore they must be medium;
and it is not necessary to push the needles too much outside the flesh and skin,
so that they do not cut and open the wound before healing;
then cut the heads of the needles so that they do not injure the patient while sleeping,
and place tents or cloths on the heads of the needles to keep them in place,
and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds,
because one or two needles suffice.
The second stitch is common,
and it is that you bring together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the siphac with one needle with a strong medium thread;
and when you have pierced all four edges together,
then bring the needle back to the part where you started, as you sew cloth;
and leave a space between each stitch the size of a small finger;
this stitch is known by people,
and I sewed a wound that a man had on his abdomen,
which was caused by a knife,
and the wound was more than a palm in size,
and two palms of intestines were protruding,
and the wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
I put the intestine back after it had been out for 24 hours,
and the wound healed within 15 days, and I treated it, and he recovered.
And the doctors had judged that he would die, and it was a miracle;
and I did not treat him with ointment, because I was in a place where none were available, nor any medicines;
and I only placed old cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until he was healed.
Now I will tell you about the two specific ways of stitching:
take the needle, and insert it from the outside part to the inside;
when it has pierced the heart straight through, leave the head of the siphac where you inserted the needle,
and make it pierce from the inside to the outside;
and the idea of this stitch is that you sew as the furrier does with skins,
and that you leave the siphac on one side once, and take it on the other, until the stitch is completely done.
The second manner of stitching, which Galen specifically mentions,
is like some do, who join the two parts together naturally,
and they apply one end of the siphac to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle at the nearest point of the wound, and pierce only that place,
and leave the two ends of the siphac;
then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outside to the inside,
with the two ends of the siphac;
then make each one pierce from the outside to the inside, on the other side of the wound;
and this is the best and most common manner of stitching.
Galen said this, and some testify,
that one should sew the abdomen with two needles, each with a thread;
and one should insert one needle on one side and the other on the other side, like those who sew belts;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen,
the stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.
The judgment of the wound is like the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with its blood, before it has changed,
then put the intestine back, and sew it; then apply the powder that generates flesh,
and if it has changed, then apply any available ointment, until the wound opens;
and let the threads fall, and let the siphac and the wound heal;
then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you do not have medicines, then apply, as soon as it starts to discharge, old cotton,
and change it twice a day until it is healed.
Because you do not need other medicine in many situations when the wounds are simple;
and if you doubt that the wound might cause complications to the principal members,
then it is necessary to moisten light wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil,
and place it around the groin, and under the armpits;
and if there is pain or decay in the bowels, and it often happens,
then give them an enema with warm dark wine, especially if the decay reaches the intestine;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small.
The intestine called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is wounded,
and this is because of the abundance of veins there, and the delicacy of the whole body, and its proximity to the nerves.
And if the fat protrudes from the wound, put it back just like the intestine, as long as it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become green or black, it is necessary to tie the place that is black, so that no blood flow reaches it,
because there are veins and arteries;
then cut what is between the ties,
and place the two hanging ends from the lower part of the wound to the outside to ease the extraction when the fat falls, and the wound opens.
Regarding the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is torn, and the wound is small,
it can be restored in some people,
because I saw a man wounded in the abdomen with a lance;
and the wound was on the right side of the stomach,
and it festered and became a fistula, and excrement and gas came out;
I treated it as best I could, and did not stop treating it until it was healed, and the place sealed.
And when I saw it heal, I feared that the patient might have pain in his abdomen;
and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be tied in this way:
take ants with large heads, then bring together the edges of the wound,
and when the ant opens its mouth, place it on the two edges,
so that it clamps its mouth shut;
then cut off its head, and it holds so that it cannot loosen,
then place another ant afterwards in the same way as before, until the wound is completely closed;
and sew the wound.
These heads stick to the intestine, and cause no harm to the patient,
and one can tie the intestine with a fine thread made from the intestine of an animal,
in this way:
take the end of this intestinal thread that is well cleaned,
then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread,
then thread the needle, and sew the intestine, and return it to the rupture;
and this method of stitching with ants is only used in cases of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no skill or health, except subtlety.
