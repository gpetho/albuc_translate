Chapter seventeen on cutting the warding and what grows of excess flesh in the eye.	CHAPTER SEVENTEEN. On cutting for chemosis and superfluous flesh in the eye.	0.76775193
Red, overlapping flesh may grow in the eyes of some people until it covers the pupil, or comes close to it, or overflows onto the eyelids. And sometimes the eyelids turn outwards, and it resembles a pomegranate flower.	Sometimes in the eye of certain people a red granulation grows up and increases so as to block the pupil or nearly so; or it grows over the eyelids and often turns the lids outward, and it resembles the blossom of the pomegranate.	0.84961206
The procedure for this is to have the patient place their head in your lap, then open their eyes, and you pick up all of that red flesh with suitable small hooks, or grasp it with tweezers or forceps, then cut the flesh bit by bit until it is all gone by cutting, and be careful of the eye so as not to harm it during the procedure.	You operate for this by having the patient put his head in your lap; then he opens his eyes and you gather up the granulation whole, with suitable hooks, or hold it with tweezers or forceps. Then you cut away the first bit of flesh and then the next, until you have cut it all away; and beware of damaging the eye in the course of operation.	0.8491212
Your cutting of it should be either with the scalpel that we described for cutting the pterygium, or with small scissors like those used to pluck hairs, as their image will appear in the chapter following this chapter.	Your incision should be made with the scalpel which we described for the incision of pterygium; or with small scissors like those with which one gathers up pannus, as shown in the chapter after this.	0.8885143
Once your cutting is complete and all the fleshy growth is gone, fill the eye with crushed salt, or drip into it red vitriol and similar corrosive medications, and apply cotton with egg white on the eye from the outside to prevent hot swelling.	And when you have finished your incision and removed all the chemosis, fill the eye with powdered salt or instil the red powder or similar corrosive; and apply to the outside of the eye cotton wool with white of egg to ward off an abscess.	0.80914235
If any of the fleshy growth remains and the bleeding overwhelms you, and you fear hot swelling, then leave the eye and treat it with something that soothes the swelling, then return to it with the procedure until it heals.	If there is any chemosis left and blood is getting the better of you and you fear an abscess, then desist and treat the eye with those means for settling a tumour. Thereafter return to your operation till cured.	0.779129
And likewise do the same with the excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type, except that you should avoid treating any eye that is weak by nature or by accidental cause with iron instruments.	So must you do with superfluous flesh that arises in the eye. But you must avoid treating surgically any eye that is weak, whether congenitally or by acquired disease.	0.753005
And do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that the organ can tolerate that procedure.	Never set your hand to an operation of this kind till you have seen if the organ can endure such an operation.	0.79132885
