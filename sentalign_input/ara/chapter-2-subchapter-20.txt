Chapter Twenty.
On Reducing Eye Protrusion.
If the eye protrudes in its entirety without causing any damage or impairment to vision, you should first reassure the patient.  Then bleed him from the cephalic vein, then place a cupping glass on the nape of the neck without scarification, and apply gentle suction.
Then, apply a poultice to the eye made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.  Then bandage the eye tightly over the poultice with many compresses.  The method for the compresses is to take many soft rags and fold each cloth into four layers, making many of them.
Then place them one on top of the other as much as the eye requires, then tie them tightly with a strong cloth. Reapply the cupping glass with suction, without scarification. Then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during that time, it should be tightened again.  Then, after a day and a night, remove the bandage as we have said. If you see that the eye has returned to its place, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the application of the poultice, the compresses, the bandaging, and the cupping glass until it returns.
