of old pain in any limb When pain comes in a limb, either from a fall or a blow, and this pain lasts a long time, and medical treatment is of no use, then it must be cauterized with the cautery which is called "points," and the cauterization should be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and weakness and its strength and location of the twisting pain.	When pain occurs in some limb due to a fall or a blow and the pain becomes chronic and medical treatment has no effect upon it, you should cauterize it with the punctate cautery. In each case the cauterization should be in proportion to the size of the limb, its strength or weakness, and the chronicity of the pain and contusion in it.	0.8128482
If he is healed from the first cauterization, that's good; if not, repeat another cauterization over it, because it is customary that it should move to the limb that is nearest to it, so you must do the cauterizations until the patient is healed.	If it is cured at the first cauterization, good; otherwise repeat the cauterization. For it is customary for these pains to move from one part to a neighbouring part, and you must follow them with the cautery till the patient is cured.	0.8601777
