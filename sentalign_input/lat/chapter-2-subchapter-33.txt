On Stabilizing Loose Teeth with Gold Wire.
Chapter 33.
When the front teeth are shaken or loosened due to an impact or fall, and the patient cannot bite down properly without risking tooth loss, and you have attempted to treat them with astringent medications without success, the best approach is to stabilize the teeth using gold wire. This is because silver turns green and corrodes over time, while gold remains unchanged.
The wire should be of moderate thickness and fineness, appropriate to fit securely between the teeth.
The procedure for stabilization involves taking the wire, doubling it, and threading it between two healthy teeth. Then, weave the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth—whether one or multiple—until you reach a healthy tooth on the other side.
Next, weave the wire back to where you started, tightening it with precision and skill until the loose teeth are entirely stable. The constriction should be close to the roots to prevent movement.
Cut off the excess ends of the wire with scissors, twist the two ends together with forceps, and conceal them between a healthy tooth and a loose one to avoid irritating the tongue. Then leave it in place until the teeth are secure.
If the wire loosens or breaks, replace it with a new one, and it will hold in place over time.
This is the form and arrangement of the teeth in stabilizing two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as shown.
Sometimes, one or two teeth can return to their original positions after such stabilization and will stay in place, but only a skilled and experienced practitioner can accomplish this.
In some cases, a piece of cow bone may be shaped like a tooth and placed in the gap, securing the tooth as described. This placement is stable and can last a long time.
