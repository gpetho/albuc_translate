On the method of cauterizing for numbness.
Chapter 50.
When a limb is numb and has been treated with medicines, oils, and poultices without healing, then cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to its size, whether large or small.
Let your cautery penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Sometimes numbness in the hand or foot is treated by cauterizing at the vertebrae of the back, near the exit points of the nerves that control that limb, and the numbness is relieved.
However, only those who are knowledgeable in the anatomy of the body and the pathways of nerves controlling movement should attempt this.
