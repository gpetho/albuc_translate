Chapter Fifty-One:
On the cauterization of abscesses.
When any abscess is slow to mature, either because of excess causing it, the patient's old age, their decrepit state, low blood, or the weather, and you want to hasten its maturation, then cauterize around it with many small puncturing cauteries; then leave it as it will hasten the maturation.
But if you want to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery in this shape: place it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in that lower area, so the body of the abscess is relieved; then treat it until it heals.
