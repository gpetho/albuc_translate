On the Treatment of Pterygium.
This condition, which is called pterygium, is a growth that gathers in the eye, resembling but not actually, flowing water.  The way to operate is to sit the patient upright on a chair, then take his head in your two hands.
And move it until you see the growth descend in the eye, then it becomes fixed and does not move, and the light breaks through and the patient sees things as he used to. If it does not descend, we know that it is fluid. If the descent of the growth cannot be achieved by what we have describedâ€¦
Otherwise, sit the patient before you, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision above the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the limbus until the material comes out.
Once it comes out, instill into the eye hot water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled. Then treat with other medications until healed.
