Of the swelling that cannot mature
When someone has a disease called "adubelati", and it takes a long time to ripen either because of the excess it produces or because of the patient's age when he is decrepit (which means too old) and has little blood, or because of the time; and you want to hasten it to ripen: then cauterize around it with many small pricking cauteries; afterward, leave it like this. Because it will hasten to ripen.
And if you want to pierce it with the cautery, heat the cautery, the form of which is:
And place your hand in the middle of this disease called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it outside in such a way that the flow of the putrid matter is eased. Afterward, treat it until it is perfectly healed.
