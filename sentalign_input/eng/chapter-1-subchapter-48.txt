 CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT.
On cauterization for numbness.
 When some limb is affected with numbness and it is treated with drugs and ointments and plasters, but is not cured, burn the benumbed limb itself with cauterizations proportionate to its bigness or smallness.
Let the cauterization somewhat penetrate the thickness of the skin; then dress with ointments till healed.
For numbness that occurs in the hand or foot it is possible to cauterize over the dorsal vertebrae at the exit of the nerve activating that part; and the numbness will go.
This should not be attempted except by one who has a good knowledge of the anatomy of the limbs and of the exits of the nerves that move the body.
