to pierce the anus/rectum
Many children are born who do not have a pierced anus, but it is blocked by a thin membrane:
therefore the midwife must pierce this membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp spatula, and take care that she does not touch the band (frenulum);
then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you are worried that it will close up again, put a lead tube in the hole, and leave it for several days, and remove it when the child needs to go to the toilet.
And sometimes this blockage comes from the healing of a wound or an abscess;
so it is necessary to cut this adhesion:
then it should be treated, as we have said, with the lead tube.
