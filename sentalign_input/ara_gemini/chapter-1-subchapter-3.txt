The third chapter on cauterizing non-chronic migraine.
If pain occurs in the fissure of the head along with a headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then induce vomiting in the patient with medicines that purify the head, and employ all the other treatments that I mentioned in the classification of diseases.
If that is not effective, then cauterization is done in two ways.
Either cauterization with a sharp, burning medication or with iron.
As for cauterization with a burning medication, it is that you take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Then incise the place of the pain on the temple with a wide scalpel until there is a space under the skin that can accommodate the clove, so it enters under the skin until it disappears.
Then tighten it with a bandage, tightly, and leave it for about fifteen hours.
Then untie it and take out the garlic and leave the wound for two or three days.
Then apply cotton dipped in ghee to it until the place suppurates.
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, you can do this with some of the burning medications that I provided in the eighteenth article on burning medications.
And as for cauterizing it with iron, it is in this manner: you heat the cautery iron, which is of this form:
And it is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head is like the shape of a nail, with some curvature and a small protrusion in its middle.
Then you place it on the painful area and hold your hand while you rotate the iron little by little.
And the amount you burn of the skin's thickness should be like half of it, and you lift your hand so as not to burn the artery that is underneath, causing bleeding.
Then you soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area and leave it for three days, then you load the cotton with ghee, then you treat it with the ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the knife-like edge coming from the cautery, and be careful of cutting the artery in this migraine, especially if it's not chronic.
