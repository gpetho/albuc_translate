of the worms that arise between skin and flesh
This disease is called in our land "ox disease", because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm that arises between skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body ascending and descending, and one feels it moving from limb to limb, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and comes out; and it is generated from the putrefaction of certain humors, as worms and snakes and earthworms and ascarids arise in the belly; and one fears its malice, for when it goes through the body, and it rises to the head, and it comes to the eye, perhaps it enters and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you want to treat it and draw it out, it can only be done when it moves: so you must tie the place above and below with a strong, tight ligature, then cut over it and draw it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you cannot find it, cauterize it with fire above, until it dies; and the greatest harm it does is that it damages the eye, as we have said; and if you see it coming in the head near the eye, squeeze the eyebrow tightly below it, then cut over it, and draw it out; and the patient must use cleansing of the body with laxative medicines for the bad putrid humors, and beware of foods generating putrefaction.
