Regarding the fracture of the wrist bone.
When the pubic bone of a woman is broken, have her sit spread-legged, then lean her towards her back, and have her held from behind; then the attendant fills the patient's vagina with cotton, and puts in as much as a fist; then have the woman stand up, and raise her back little by little, and then the cotton will jump out, until it comes to the opening of the vagina, and the bone returns with the fist; and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back in, and do this for seven days or thereabouts: the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a tube to the opening, and insert the whole bladder into the vagina; then blow strongly into the tube, until the bladder is inflated inside: the vagina will return the fracture; then fill it with cotton, and leave it like that for a few days, until it is healed.
And when the wrist bone of a man or woman is broken, restore it as we have described for the hip bone; and these fractures are not hidden from those who study and practice them, and understand my book.
For the fracture itself indicates in many ways the right path to restoration: understand this then.
For the penis, when it is broken, take a goose feather and place the penis inside it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or thereabouts, and it will be quickly healed.
