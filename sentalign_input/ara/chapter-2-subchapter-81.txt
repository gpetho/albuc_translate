Chapter Eighty-One.
On Lancing Hemorrhoids that Bleed, Excising Them, and Treating Fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types. Either they are inside the anus, resembling red blisters or like grape seeds, and they are small and large, and blood flows from them constantly.
And they are single and they are many, and they are outside the anus and on its edges, except that those that are outside the anus are mostly less moist, and a yellow fluid or a little blood flows from them constantly, and they are the color of the skin. 
And the treatment for those that are inside the anus is that you order the patient to defecate and strain until the anus protrudes and the warts appear to you, then you quickly grasp them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, then you cut them at their roots if the hooks will not hold in them due to their moisture and looseness.
Then rub it with a coarse cloth or a piece of rough bread, or pull it with your fingers, then cut it. Then sprinkle on it after cutting some sharp powders to act as cautery for it, or cauterize it as described previously in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with other treatments until it heals. If the anus does not respond to you for protrusion, then give the patient an enema that has a little pungency to wash what is in the anus, and it will come out quickly when the patient strains. As for external hemorrhoids, their treatment is easy and simple.
And that is that you take it with your fingernail or hook it with a hook and cut it, then treat it with what we mentioned until it heals.  And whoever dislikes cutting with iron should try piercing it in this manner: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the wart upwards and pierce it with the needle at its base from the other side, and wrap the ends of the thread under the needle while it is transverse, and tighten the wart tightly and firmly, then knot the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all the warts, leaving one that you do not pierce.
so that excess blood may flow from it. Then place a cloth dipped in rose oil or cerate on the anus and place it on the anus, and tell the patient to remain still. Then leave him until they fall off. When the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often occur from dryness of the stool and constipation. If it becomes chronic and no medicine is effective for it, then it should be scraped with the blade of a scalpel or your fingernail until it becomes moist and the top layer that prevents it from healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals as it should. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping, more severely than the first time, until it bleeds slightly and peels. Then treat it, and it will heal.
