When a swelling appears on a limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then cauterize it on the limb according to the size of the limb; and let the cauterization go a little deep into the flesh; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.	When some limb is affected with numbness and it is treated with drugs and ointments and plasters, but is not cured, burn the benumbed limb itself with cauterizations proportionate to its bigness or smallness. Let the cauterization somewhat penetrate the thickness of the skin; then dress with ointments till healed.	0.8419359
And sometimes cauterization is done on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the swelling is removed; however, no one should undertake this unless they are knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.	For numbness that occurs in the hand or foot it is possible to cauterize over the dorsal vertebrae at the exit of the nerve activating that part; and the numbness will go. This should not be attempted except by one who has a good knowledge of the anatomy of the limbs and of the exits of the nerves that move the body.	0.76446986
