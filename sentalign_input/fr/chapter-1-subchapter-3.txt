of the cautery of the head
When sudden pain comes in one part of the head and the disease extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed by purifying medicines, and the other treatments mentioned in the division of diseases are applied, and none of this helps: then make cauteries in two ways, namely with sharp medicine and with iron.
The cautery with sharp medicine is made by taking a clove of garlic, removing the peel, and cutting it a little at both ends, then cutting the temple where the pain is so that you can insert the clove of garlic under the skin; when it is inserted, bind and press it well and leave it for twelve hours; then untie it and remove the clove of garlic, and leave the wound like this for two or three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter until the rot comes out.
Afterward, treat the wound with ointment until it is healed; and if you wish, use some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is done in this manner. Heat the cautery which has this shape:
It is called "clos" because the head is shaped like a nail with a slight curve, and in the middle, it has a small protrusion; place it on the painful spot, hold your hand and turn the iron slightly, until half the thickness of the core is burned; then lift your hand so that the artery above does not burn, and a lot of blood flows.
Afterward, apply cotton soaked in salt water to the spot for three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the spot with ointment until it is healed; and if you want, cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare", with the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
