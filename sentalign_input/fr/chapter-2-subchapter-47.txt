Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, so that they resemble women's breasts;
and they remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, must cut them according to this form from line b. to g.:
then peel the fat, and fill the wound with medicine that generates flesh, then sew the two lips of the wound together, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops down, and is softened due to its size as happens to women, then cut it in two parts on top, with two similar incisions;
of which one is connected to the other at the end of both, so that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this form, from line b. to line g.;
then peel the skin between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders, and what is necessary for the cure, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not fully done, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the blood flow, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment;
and leave it until it consumes the remaining fat, then treat it until it is healed.
