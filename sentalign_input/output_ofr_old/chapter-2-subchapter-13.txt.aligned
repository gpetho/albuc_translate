When this disease called "aleacrati" or rot comes to the eye, there are two types: one natural, and the other unnatural. And it occurs by the healing of a wound, or by cutting or cautery, and by similar things.	Now sometimes this inversion is natural, sometimes acquired. It is acquired either from the cicatrization of an injury, or an incision, or cauterization, or the like.	0.5457178
And the manner of the procedure is that you cut that adhesion, and separate the lips of it, and place linen tents inside, and bind it until it is healed; and you must not use in the treatment of it any drying and constricting substances. For if you do this, the disease will return worse than before; but treat it with softening substances, such as fenugreek; and sprinkle it with water or mallow and linseed cooked, and dyacylon ointment melted in some oils, and wrap a tent in it, and treat it with this.	The idea of the operation is to excise the scar, separate the edges of the wound, pack linen between them, and bandage up till healed. In the treatment of it you should not use anything styptic or drying, for if you do the inversion will return worse than ever before. Employ relaxing substances such as fenugreek; and fomentation with water in which mallows and linseed have been boiled; and diachylon plaster which has been previously softened with one of the oils and spread on the packs; and treat it with this.	0.8719926
And the treasure of your treatment is that you take care that it does not heal in the same form as before; and this procedure that we have mentioned is only for addressing this disease, so that it does not return in the same form as before.	The main thing in the treatment is to use every device to prevent the healing up of the place as it was before. This operation which we have described is but some correction of the inversion, not that the appearance of the place will necessarily revert to what it was.	0.6692856
