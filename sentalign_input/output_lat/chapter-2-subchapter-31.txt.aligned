On the extraction of roots and of broken pieces of mandible.	On Tooth Extraction and Removal of Fractured Jaw Bones.	0.6800303
When, in extracting a tooth, a broken-off root remains behind, you should apply to the place cotton wool soaked in butter for one or two days to soften it; then insert the tongs or forceps with stork-bill jaws; this is the figure of the forceps.	If a part of the tooth breaks and remains after extraction, place a poultice with butter on the site for one or two days until it softens. Then, insert a tool, such as an algast or forceps, whose tips resemble the beak of a bird known as the stork. This is the form of the forceps.	0.7284863
The point should be made like a file or rasp on the inside.	The tips should have an inner surface like a file or like aliskilfegi (a type of file or rough surface).	0.56540203
If it does not respond to your attempt to extract it with these forceps, you must dig down over the root and remove all the flesh, and then insert the instrument that resembles a small crowbar; this is its figure.	If the tooth does not respond and come out with these forceps, then you must carefully work around the root, exposing all surrounding tissue, and insert an instrument known as the “small lever,” which has this form.	0.71653295
It has a short rather thick extremity, and should not be tempered lest it fracture.	It should have a short, somewhat thick end and should not be too fine, to avoid breaking.	0.8527267
If the root comes out, good; if not, get assistance from the other instruments figured here.	If the root comes out this way, that is ideal. If not, use other tools, which have the following shapes.	0.77050966
First, with a triangular point, somewhat stout.	The first instrument has a triangular tip with some thickness.	0.70470655
Another, triangular and slender.	Another is a triangular but finer tip.	0.7298889
Sometimes also we get help from this forked instrument and beside this, from other instruments and appliances mentioned above under scraping of teeth.	These tools, along with those previously described for tooth scraping, can be of great assistance.	0.53358614
Sometimes also recourse may be had to this instrument resembling a large hook, figured thus. The hooked extremity is triangular in section, of some thickness lest it break, not tempered.	A further helpful tool resembles a large hook with a twisted, triangular tip of substantial thickness to prevent breakage; it should not be too fine.	0.74717736
You should know that dental instruments are very numerous, as are the other instruments, almost beyond reckoning. And the experienced worker with a knowledge of his craft may devise fresh instruments according as his work on actual cases suggests them to him.	Know that there are many dental instruments, and countless other tools as well. A skilled practitioner, clever in their craft, often discovers suitable tools themselves based on the needs of the operation and the specific ailments.	0.79123247
For there are certain diseases for which the Ancients did not mention any instruments, on account of the variety of them.	There are some conditions for which the ancients did not provide specific instruments due to the varied nature of such cases.	0.6926658
Now if the mandible or one of the bones of the mouth be broken or decayed, explore the site with some instrument that is suitable for it, namely one of the instruments or forceps mentioned for extraction of roots. We also make use of forceps of this form.	If a jaw bone or another bone of the mouth fractures or decays, carefully explore the area with the appropriate instruments and forceps mentioned for root extraction, and use a tool called “gesti,” shaped as follows.	0.76788414
They are fairly thick, to grip the bone firmly lest it slip before the bone has been got out. Then cicatrize the place with suitable drugs.	The “gesti” should gradually narrow, allowing a firm grip on the bone so it does not slip or move, ensuring complete removal. Then, treat the area with suitable medications.	0.5839362
If the bone is only slightly decayed, scrape it clean of its decay and blackness, then dress till healed.	If there is minor decay in the bone, scrape away the rot and treat the bone until it heals.	0.72871125
