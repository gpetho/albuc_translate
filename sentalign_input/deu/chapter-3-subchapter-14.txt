Chapter 14:
On the restoration of fractures of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone often breaks and is identified by its misalignment forward and upward.
Restoration involves tightly bandaging the fracture and another bandage below it, with the patient lying face down.
An assistant should extend the entire bandage according to the injury's nature when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
If near the hip joint, place the bandage near the knee on the thigh so that the extension is upward, and another bandage below the fracture.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, place the bandage near the knee and extend it downward.
The doctor should then align the bone with both hands to its natural position and ensure good alignment; then apply a plaster and bandage unless there is an abscess.
If an abscess occurs, leave it for a few days until it subsides, then return to the treatment.
The bandage should be applied firmly, doubled two or three times, and any excess removed; then wrap the leg from the foot to the hip.
Place a long cloth between the thigh and leg near the knee, with the ends reaching the uppermost part of the leg, and wrap any excess cloth around the leg and thigh.
Place splints over the fracture on the thigh and another splint on the leg bone.
Fill the gaps between the leg and thigh with soft cloths to ensure firm bandaging.
Start with a tight bandage in the middle of the fracture with three or four wraps, and as you move away from the fracture site, make the bandage looser and softer.
Extend the ends of the cloth to the lower parts, reaching the ankle, and tighten both ends of the splints so the bandage stays in place.
Leave the bandage as it is, ensuring it doesn't cause corrosion, severe abscess, or swelling; if any such issues arise, quickly remove the bandage and correct the issue as described.
If there is a bone fragment, align it as much as possible; if not, remove it and treat it according to previous instructions until healed.
Sometimes this fracture of the thigh is supported with splints as described for the forearm and arm.
In this manner of restoration, the patient does not develop a limp; if restored alone without the other leg's support, the patient will likely limp.
Know that the thigh should be bandaged for 40 days, give or take, depending on the patient's constitution and other factors.
