When there is looseness of the bowels due to cold and moisture, which weakens the stomach and intestinal retention and digestive functions, and if usual treatments fail, and the patient is strong enough to tolerate cauterization, apply a large cautery to the stomach, as previously described in stomach cauterization using a circular cautery. Apply four delicate cauteries around the navel, using a fine nail-like cautery tool, and another on the alcatin (just above the pubic bone), using a large cautery or two smaller ones.	When the diarrhoea is due to frigidity and humidities so that the capacity of the stomach and intestines to hold and to digest is impaired, and this has been treated by various methods and is not cured; if you see that the patient is able to endure the cautery and is of unimpaired strength, make a big cauterization on his stomach according to the preceding instructions for cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery; and four narrow cauterizations round his navel with the thin claviform cautery; and one or two big cauterizations in the lumbar region over the coccyx.	0.83290744
If you see an excess of moisture and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize over the pubic area and over each iliac crest. You may add two small cauteries on the stomach, close to the larger one.	And if you see that the humidities are superabundant, and the patient fit to tolerate it, then make one cauterization over the groin and one over the hypochondrium. You may also add two small ones over the stomach near the big one.	0.8460296
