If the hemorrhoids are due to phlegm and cold humors, and they do not respond to ripening with medications, and you want rapid ripening, then heat the hollow cautery iron, which is depicted here, with both ends open.	When the tumours arise from phlegm and cold humidities and are not to be dispersed with medicines and you wish for a rapid dispersal, then heat the hollow cautery of which this is the figure. It is open at both ends to give exit for the fumes of burning from the other end.	0.7094592
So that the smoke may come out of the other end during cauterization, place it, heated, upon the swelling itself, once and a second time if needed, until you reach the depth of the swelling.  If the swelling is small, then make the cautery the size of the swelling.	It is open at both ends to give exit for the fumes of burning from the other end. Place it hot, right on the tumour, once, or twice if need be, till you reach the bottom of the tumour. If the tumour be small, suit the cautery to the size of the tumour.	0.7956252
Then leave it for three days and apply to it cotton dipped in fat until what was burned by the fire is gone, then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.	Then let be for three days and apply cotton wool soaked in butter until the eschar has disappeared. Then treat with ointments and with plugs of lint till healed. [	0.8229643
