Of the fingers
When the toes are dislocated, they should be gently extended without effort, and it is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any joint of the back of the foot, you should make the patient sit on a flat surface or a straight table, and place your foot on what is visible of these joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns;
And when it is set and nothing is visible, place a two-headed board under the sole of the foot, then bind it tightly, and leave it for three days, then untie it; and let it rest until it is healed.
