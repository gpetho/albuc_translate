When hairs other than the natural ones grow on the eyelids, and they are thick, they harm the eyes, and cause various diseases such as habitual tearing and softening of the eyelids and albugine, to the point that it causes the destruction of the eyes; and the treatment is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is before in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suturing or by hooks, according to what I will say.	When superfluous lashes grow on the eyelid outside their natural place, below the natural lashes, and continue, they injure the eye and give rise to many kinds of disease, such as chronic lachrymation, dropping of the eyelids (ptosis), and whiteness and opacity, eventually resulting in the destruction of the eye. The plastic operation on the eye is carried out in four ways: by the actual cautery; by caustic in the way mentioned above in the book on cauterization; by incision and suture; or with canes, as I shall describe.	0.79079044
and there is another method: and it is that you mark the eyelid with a figure that is like a myrtle leaf, as we have explained, with three separated hooks according to the form that is here:	Yet another way of operating is to mark on the eyelid the figure of a myrtle leaf as we have described; then lift the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or joined thus.	0.7722243
then cut what exceeds with small scissors evenly according to the form that is here:	Then cut away the superfluous lid with a small pair of scissors with an even incision. The scissors are of this pattern.	0.6235558
And if you cannot hold the pincers, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with a thread, and place it in the middle of the figure; and place another thread near the large tear duct, and the second thread near the small one, and gather the threads evenly between your fingers; then raise your hand evenly, and lift all the skin that you have marked, as we have explained, then join the two lips of the wound by stitching, and treat it until it is healed; and if an abscess comes to your incision, then soothe it with wax and similar soothing ointments;	But if you cannot conveniently hold with the hooks, take a threaded needle and introduce it into the middle of the marking; and put another thread through near the greater canthus, and a third thread near the lesser canthus. With your fingers hold the threads evenly and then raise your hand evenly and you will raise up the whole of the marked skin as we have said. Then bring the edges together with a suture and dress till healed. But if in your incision, or the opening you have made, a swelling arises, then allay the swelling with wax and similar sedatives.	0.8986776
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelid are inverted: then you must use what we have said about the incision; but the stitching in both is more artificial.	Sometimes the lower lid also has the lashes inverted. For this you should use any of the methods we have mentioned: the incision and suture, and the operation by the actual cautery and by caustic.

The treatment with hooks is according to this form: and it is that you turn the eyelid and cut inside according to what I have said, and then make two hooks by art, and two delicate threads as long as the eyelid and the width of the spatula is; and cut the two ends on two sides where you hold the threads; then join them both subtly above what exceeds the eyelid of the eye, and press the two hooks from both sides strongly; and leave it like this for some days, and the skin that is pressed will die and blacken and rot, until it falls off by itself.	Trimming the lid by means of canes is done as follows: you invert the eyelid and cut the inner slit as I have described; then you prepare two slender canes or rods of a length equal to that of the eyelid and a breadth less than that of a scalpel; and at either end of each you make a notch to hold the threads. Then gently put them together over the superfluous part of the eyelid and tie them firmly together at both ends and leave for a few days; for the ligated flesh will necrose and turn black and putrefy and eventually fall away spontaneously.	0.88200414
If it delays, then cut it with small scissors, then treat it until it is healed; and when the wound is healed, and the eyelid is lifted, and the hairs will not prick anymore; and this is the form of the two hooks that you will make according to this figure, and according to this length and width:	But if it is slow in sloughing, cut off with shears; then dress till healed. And when it is healed the eyelid will be raised and the lashes will no longer irritate the eye. Now this is the figure of the canes; you should prepare them exactly in this shape and of this length and breadth.	0.7952064
