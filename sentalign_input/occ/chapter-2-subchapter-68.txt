Chapter 68.
On the softening of the covering of the testicles.
Sometimes the covering of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh between it is softened, and its care is unpleasant.
Then it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat it to make the patient lie on his back, and cut all the covering that is softened over the natural covering; then join the two edges with the suture.
And if you want, sew at the beginning the excess of the softened covering with three or four stitches and a firm suture.
Then cut between the sutures; and then treat it as with other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall off.
