of chronic pain in any limb When pain comes to any member, either from falling or injury, and this pain lasts a long time, and medical cures do not work, then it must be cauterized with the cautery called "poins", and let the cautery be according to the length of the member and its smallness, its weakness, its strength, and its location of twists and pain. If healed by the first cautery, it is good; if not, repeat another cautery on the same spot, because such a habit is that it must be moved to the nearby member, for which it is necessary to make cauteries until the patient is healed.	When pain occurs in some limb due to a fall or a blow and the pain becomes chronic and medical treatment has no effect upon it, you should cauterize it with the punctate cautery. In each case the cauterization should be in proportion to the size of the limb, its strength or weakness, and the chronicity of the pain and contusion in it. If it is cured at the first cauterization, good; otherwise repeat the cauterization. For it is customary for these pains to move from one part to a neighbouring part, and you must follow them with the cautery till the patient is cured.	0.8705833
