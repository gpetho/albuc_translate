The author of this book said: O my children, when I completed this book for you, which is the theoretical part of medicine in its entirety, and reached the ultimate goal in its clarity and explanation, I saw fit to complete it for you with this treatise which is about the practical work by hand.
For skilled handiwork in our country and in our time is completely non-existent, to the point where its knowledge has almost been forgotten and its trace cut off.
Only slight traces of it remain in the books of the ancients, which hands have corrupted and in which errors and confusion have occurred until their meanings became locked and their benefits distant.
So I saw fit to revive it and compose this treatise about it in the way of explanation, clarification and conciseness, and to include illustrations of cauterization instruments and other tools of the work, as this adds to the clarity and is among the most important things needed.
The reason why there is no skilled craftsman with his hands in our time is because the medical craft is lengthy, and its practitioner needs to train beforehand in the science of anatomy which Galen described.
Until he understands the benefits of organs, their forms, their temperaments, their connections and separations, and knowledge of the bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers and exits, and the pulsing and still vessels and their exit points.
Therefore Hippocrates said that physicians in name are many but in deed are few, especially in handiwork, and we have mentioned some of this in the introduction of this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable in what we mentioned of anatomy will inevitably fall into errors by which he kills people, as I have witnessed many times from those who imagined themselves in this science and claimed it without knowledge or expertise.
For I saw an ignorant physician who cut into a scrofulous tumor in a woman's neck, and severed some of the neck arteries, so the woman bled until she fell dead before him.
And I saw another physician who proceeded to extract a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large, so he acted recklessly and extracted it with a piece of the bladder tissue.
The man died after about three days, and I had been called to extract it but saw from the size of the stone and the patient's condition what I estimated would happen to him.
And I saw another physician who was earning his living with one of the commanders of our country as a doctor.
A black boy in his care suffered a fracture in his leg near the heel with a wound, and the physician in his ignorance hastened to bind the fracture over the wound with bandages and splints, binding it tightly and not leaving the wound any breathing space.
Then he left him to his desires, then left him for days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage until his leg and foot became swollen and he approached death.
I was called to him and quickly loosened the bandage, so he found relief and recovered from his pains, except that corruption had already taken hold in the limb and I could not reverse it.
The corruption continued to spread in the limb until he perished.
And I saw another physician lance a cancerous tumor, and it ulcerated after days until its owner's affliction became severe, because when cancer is purely from black bile, it should not be approached with iron at all.
Unless it is in an organ that can tolerate complete excision.
Therefore, O my children, you should know that handiwork divides into two types: work accompanied by safety and work that leads to destruction in most cases.
And I have pointed out in every place that comes in this book the work that contains risk and fear, so you should beware of it and reject it.
Lest the ignorant find a way to criticism and reproach, so take for yourselves caution and vigilance, and for your patients gentleness and steadfastness.
Practice the superior path that leads to safety and praiseworthy outcomes, and avoid dangerous diseases that are difficult to cure.
Keep yourselves above what you fear might bring suspicion upon you in your religion and worldly affairs, for it is more lasting for your standing and more elevating for your worth in this world and the next.
For Galen said in some of his commandments: Do not treat an evil disease, lest you be called evil physicians.
And I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The First Chapter.
On cauterization by fire and cauterization by caustic medicine, organized systematically from head to foot, including illustrations of instruments, cautery irons, and everything needed for manual operation.
And the Second Chapter.
On incision, lancing, bloodletting, cupping, wounds, extraction of arrows and such matters, all systematically organized with illustrations of instruments.
And the Third Chapter.
On setting bones, treating dislocations, sprains and such matters, systematically organized from head to foot with illustrations of instruments.
The First Chapter.
On Cauterization.
Before we discuss its practice, we should mention its benefits and harms, and in which temperament it should be used.
I say that the discussion of the nature of cauterization's benefits and harms is a lengthy discourse, a subtle science, and a hidden secret about which many wise men have spoken.
They differed in their views, and I have summarized their words briefly to avoid lengthy exposition.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for every imbalanced temperament, whether with material or without material, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without material and the dry temperament without material.
As for the dry temperament with material, they differed about it - some said cauterization is beneficial for it, while others contradicted this, saying cauterization is not suitable for an illness caused by heat and dryness because fire's nature is hot and dry.
It is impossible to cure a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry remedy, but those who argue the opposite say that cauterization by fire can benefit a hot and dry disease that occurs in human bodies.
Because when you compare the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I agree with this statement because experience has revealed this to me many times, however, one should not imagine this matter except for those who have trained and practiced extensively in cauterization.
And who understands the different temperaments of people and the nature of diseases themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the other temperaments, you need not fear them, especially cold and wet diseases, for all physicians agree on them and do not differ about the benefit of cauterization for them.
Know, my sons, that among the secrets of treatment is cauterization by fire and its superiority over cauterization by caustic medicine, because fire is a simple substance whose effect does not exceed the cauterized organ nor harm another connected organ except slightly.
Cauterization by caustic medicine may extend its effect to distant organs and might cause a disease in the organ that is difficult to treat and might even kill, while fire, due to its nobility and the excellence of its substance, does not do this unless used excessively.
This has become clear to us through experience from long service and attention to the craft and understanding of the truth of the matter.
For this reason, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse, and were it not inappropriate for this book of mine, I would have presented to you a profound secret about fire and how it acts upon bodies and eliminates diseases, with philosophical, demonstrative speech that would be too subtle for your understanding.
Know, my sons, that they have differed about the time suitable for cauterization, and they made spring the best time.
I say that cauterization may be suitable in any season because the harm occurring due to the season is overwhelmed by the benefit obtained through cauterization.
Especially if the cauterization is for necessary, strong, urgent pains that cannot tolerate delay for fear they might be followed by an affliction greater than the slight harm entering from the season.
Do not imagine, my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians fancy, that cauterization which cures a disease will never allow its return and make it permanent.
The matter is not as they supposed because cauterization is like a medicine that alters the temperament and dries the moistures which are the cause of pain occurring.
However, cauterization is superior to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the power of its authority.
The disease may return at some time depending on the patient's temperament, the establishment of their illness and its strength, and what accumulates in their body of excess humors and their negligence in acquiring them from foods and such causes.
Unless the disease for which cauterization is used is mild and in an organ with little excess and moisture.
Like cauterizing a tooth for pain and such, for it is possible that pain may not return to it, and this occurs in the minority of cases.
As for the common saying that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, it is a correct statement but not for the reasons they believe, as they think that no treatment with medicine or otherwise is beneficial after cauterization, but the matter is contrary to this.
The meaning of "cauterization is the last resort in medicine" is that when we have used various types of treatments for an illness and those medicines did not work, then we use cauterization as a last resort and it works - this is why it is said that cauterization is the last resort in medicine.
Not in the sense understood by the common people and many ignorant physicians.
The ancients mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than with iron, and they said this because of gold's balanced nature and noble essence, and they said that the cauterized area does not suppurate, but this is not absolute.
Because I have tested this and found that it only works this way in some bodies and not others, and cauterization with it is better and superior to iron as they said, except that when you heat the cautery instrument in fire made of gold, you cannot tell when it is heated to the degree you want due to gold's redness.
And because it cools quickly, and if you increase its heat, it melts in the fire and dissolves, causing trouble for the practitioner, therefore cauterization with iron is quicker for us and closer to proper practice, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections organized from head to foot to make it easier for the student to find what they want, God willing.
First Section.
On single cauterization of the head.
This cauterization benefits from the dominance of moisture and cold in the brain, which are causes of headache and frequent discharges from the head to the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, tooth pain, and throat pains.
And in general, for every disease that occurs from cold such as paralysis, epilepsy, stroke, and similar diseases.
The procedure for this cauterization is to first order the patient to purge with a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights according to what the patient's strength, age, and habits require.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor, then seat him before you cross-legged with his hands placed on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes, and where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery which is of this form.
If bone is exposed about the size of a pin head or a vetch seed, remove your hand; if not, reapply your hand with the same iron or another if it has cooled.
Until you see the amount of bone I mentioned to you, then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak a piece of cotton in it and place it on the spot and leave it for three days.
Then apply cotton soaked in ghee and leave it until the scab from the burn falls off, then treat it with the quaternary ointment until it heals, God willing.
They have said that the longer the wound remains open, draining pus, the better and more beneficial it is.
Some mentioned that one should cauterize the skin to the bone and hold the cautery until some of the bone's thickness burns, then scrape away what was burned from the bone, then treat it.
Others said one should be thorough with the cauterization until it makes a strong impression on the bone until a piece of bone falls off like a carat or small disc, and they claimed that the head's vapors are released from that spot, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then treat until it heals, but I do not support these two types of cauterization at all except in some people and as a risk, and leaving it alone is better in my opinion and safer, because when it happens, the head weakens when its natural continuity is broken, as we have observed in other organs.
Especially when the patient's head is naturally weak, and the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion, and it is what I use, so practice it and you will be safe, God willing.
Second Section.
On cauterization of the head also.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head and persists with the patient, and they have used medicines, poultices, nasal drops, oils, and compresses, especially if they have already had the single cauterization we described and none of that benefited them, then observe.
If the patient's head is naturally strong in constitution and not weak, and they feel severe cold, then cauterize another spot slightly above the first one.
Then cauterize each horn of his head with a cauterization until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone we described is exposed.
And cauterize a spot at the back of his head in the place known as the axe, and lighten your hand in this one and do not expose the bone, for the patient will feel severe pain unlike the pain of all other head cauterizations, and I will mention this cauterization in its place.
The cautery used for the horns of the head and its back should be finer than the cautery used for the middle of the head, and this is its form.
Chapter Three.
On cauterization for non-chronic migraine.
If pain occurs in one side of the head with headache and the pain extends to the eye, then purge the patient with medicines that cleanse the head and use all the other treatments that I mentioned in the classification of diseases, and if that doesn't work, then cauterization can be done in two ways.
Either cauterization with sharp burning medicine or with iron.
As for cauterization with burning medicine, take a single clove of garlic, peel it and cut its ends from both sides, then make an incision at the site of pain in the temple with a wide lancet until there is space under the skin that can fit the clove.
Insert it under the skin until it disappears, then bind it firmly with bandages and leave it for about fifteen hours, then untie it and remove the garlic and leave the wound for two or three days, then apply.
Place cotton soaked in ghee on it until the site suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If you wish, you can do this with some of the burning medicines that I mentioned in the eighteenth treatise on burning medicines.
As for cauterizing it with iron, it is done in this manner: heat the cautery that looks like this:.
It is called the nail cautery because its head is like a nail with some doming and has a small protrusion in its middle.
Then place it on the site of pain and hold your hand while rotating the iron slightly, and the amount you burn should be about half the thickness of the skin.
Lift your hand so as not to burn the artery below which would cause bleeding, then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the site and leave it for three days.
Then apply cotton with ghee, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, you can cauterize this migraine with the protruding knife-like end of the cautery, being careful not to cut the artery, especially in this non-chronic migraine.
Chapter Four.
On cauterization of chronic migraine.
If you have treated the migraine with what we mentioned of the previous treatment and what we mentioned in the classification of diseases, and the treatment doesn't work, and you see that the condition cannot be managed by what we mentioned of the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire.
Then you should heat the knife-like cautery until it turns white, after marking the site of pain with a line half a finger long or so, and release your hand once while pressing firmly until you cut the artery and reach near the bone.
However, you should be careful of touching the jaw that moves during chewing so you don't burn the muscle or nerve that moves it, which would cause spasm.
Be cautious and vigilant about bleeding from the artery you cut, for there is risk in cutting it.
Especially for one who is ignorant of what to do and is not experienced and practiced - abandoning the procedure is preferable.
The management of bleeding that occurs from the artery will be mentioned properly in its place in the book, God willing. If you see that the condition cannot be managed by this cauterization.
And you see that the patient's body can tolerate it, then cauterize a spot in the middle of the head as we described and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, you can use the cauterization that we mentioned in the chapter on arterial extraction with the double-bladed cautery, for it is better and more effective than this.
Chapter Five.
On cauterization for ear pains.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with purgatives and other treatments that we mentioned in the classification but the pain doesn't go away, then heat the cautery called the point cautery that looks like this.
Then make points with it after heating it around the entire ear in a circle, or around both if the pain is in both.
Keep the cauterization slightly away from the base of the ear after marking the site with ink, and make about ten points of cauterization for each ear or thereabouts, then treat the sites until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six.
On cauterization for facial paralysis.
The facial paralysis that is treated with cauterization is only of the type that occurs from phlegm as I mentioned in the classification of diseases.
And avoid cauterizing the type that occurs from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you have treated this type of facial paralysis with electuaries, nasal drops, and gargles and your treatment doesn't work, then the patient should be cauterized with three cauterizations.
One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below his temple, and the third at the meeting of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the opposite side of the diseased part because the relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The form of cauterization is that you cauterize a spot opposite the upper tip of the ear slightly below the horn of the head, and another in the temple, and its length should be about the length of a thumb.
Lower your hand with the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin, and this is the image of the cautery which is a type of knife-like instrument previously illustrated, except it is slightly more delicate as you see.
The knife should be slightly thicker, then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On Cauterizing Chronic Apoplexy.
When apoplexy becomes chronic and you have treated it as we mentioned but your treatment was not effective and the patient has no fever, then cauterize them with four cauterizations.
One cauterization on each horn of their head, one cauterization in the middle of the head as we mentioned, and one cauterization at the back of the head as previously described.
The description of the cauteries is as previously mentioned, and you may also apply a cauterization on the mouth of the stomach which would be more effective, then treat as previously mentioned.
Chapter Eight.
On Cauterizing Forgetfulness.
That which is caused by phlegm - the patient should first be given major purgatives and pills that purify the brain.
Then shave their entire head and apply the mustard plaster described in the chapter on plasters multiple times, for it is a type of cauterization.
Do this in the exact order I mentioned there, and if they are cured by this, fine, otherwise cauterize them with three cauterizations at the back of their head, arranged in a line from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
Make the space between each cauterization the width of a finger, then treat the cauterization as previously mentioned. If you want to increase and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle cauterization.
If you want to increase further, cauterize on the horns then treat until healed, and the cautery should be olive-shaped as previously illustrated.
Chapter Nine.
On Cauterizing Paralysis and Total Body Relaxation.
You should first proceed with purifying the head with purgatives as we mentioned, then shave the patient's head, then cauterize once in the middle of the head, once on each horn of the head, and once on its back.
And three times on the vertebrae of the neck, and if you need more than that for the condition of body relaxation, and the patient can tolerate it and the disease is strong and established, then cauterize four times on the vertebrae of the back.
Press firmly with the cautery until you burn most of the skin then lift your hand, then treat as previously mentioned until healed God willing, and the cautery should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
On Cauterizing Epilepsy.
Only cauterize the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm, and you should first purify their brain with major purgatives and with all the treatment we mentioned in the classification if the patient is adult and can tolerate taking medicines.
But if they are a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then use gargles and mouth washes that purify the brain for many days before that, while improving their nutrition.
Then shave their head then cauterize once in the middle of the head as previously described and another cauterization at its back.
And one cauterization on each horn of their head, and if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, apply the cauterizations mentioned for the paralysis and body relaxation patient on the vertebrae of the neck and back vertebrae, and the cautery should be olive-shaped as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery delicate like this illustration.
Chapter Eleven.
On Cauterizing Melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, apply the cauterizations we mentioned for the paralysis patient.
If the cause of melancholia is excess tending toward black bile and the patient's body is moist, give them what purifies their brain as previously mentioned in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head then make a firm ring of linen like a circle then place it in the middle of their head while the patient sits cross-legged held from all sides, then take one pound of aged sheep butter.
Then heat it on fire moderately until a finger can tolerate being inserted in it, then pour it in the middle of the head in the circle and leave it until it cools, do this to the patient once every week along with the rest of their good regimen until they heal God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize with many small dots without holding your hand with the cautery but rather just hovering for this type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply cotton soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing cataracts in the eye.
When you identify the beginning of a cataract in the eye through the signs mentioned in the classification, hasten to give the patient what purifies his head, protect him from all moistures, and make him sweat in the bath on an empty stomach for days.
Then order him to shave his head and cauterize once in the middle of the head, then cauterize twice on the temples if the beginning of the cataract is in both eyes, or on one side if it is in one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries under the skin, and let the cauterizations be long across the temples, and guard against blood loss.
If you see any of it [bleeding], stop it immediately by whatever treatment possible, and we will come to the wisdom of extracting and cutting arteries and protecting against bleeding.
And two deep cauterizations should be made in the nape below the two bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
On cauterizing chronic tears.
If the eye tears are chronic and continuous, and they are caused by the veins and arteries that are on the outside of the head, and you are certain that this is from cold, thick phlegmatic excess, then cauterize as I described exactly in the beginning of cataracts.
One cauterization in the middle of the head and two on the temples and two in the nape below the two bones, and if you need more, cauterize once on each side of the tail of the eye at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing nose putrefaction.
If you have treated it with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment wasn't successful, hasten to give the patient the quqaya for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle cauterization with the olive-shaped cautery.
Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery twice above the eyebrows slightly below the hair and be careful of the artery not to cut it, and this is the shape of the nail-shaped one.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing drooping eyelids.
If the eyelid droops due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize slightly above the eyebrows twice on each side and stay away from the temples, and let each cauterization be along the length of the eyebrow.
Don't let your hand be excessive in cauterizing, but only enough to burn a third of the skin, and the shape of the cautery should be of this description.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its eyelashes turn inward and prick the eye, there are two types of cauterization.
Either cauterization with fire or cauterization with burning medicine. As for cauterization with fire, order the patient beforehand to leave his eyelashes if he is someone who plucks them, until they grow long and even.
If they prick him when they grow, bind his eyes with a bandage so they don't move until they grow, and when they have grown and evened out, place the patient's head in your lap then mark on the eyelid with ink a mark in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
The mark should begin near the eyelashes, then place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or psyllium mucilage, then heat a cautery of this shape.
Then cauterize over the shape you marked little by little many times until the surface of the skin which is in the shape of the myrtle leaf is all burned, especially its surface, and the sign of your work being correct is that you see the eyelid has retracted and the hair has risen from the flesh of the eye.
Remove your hand then and leave it for three days, then apply cotton with butter until the scab falls off, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If any hair returns after time and the eyelid droops.
Then repeat the cauterization on that spot as you did the first time. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and the hair doesn't prick the eye. As for cauterization with burning medicine, order the patient to leave the eyelashes until they grow long and even.
Then make from paper the shape of a myrtle leaf, then take regular soap and unslaked lime, one dirham weight or so of each, and grind them together well, and do this quickly lest it dry.
Then spread it on the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf and place it on one or both eyelids and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white with the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger over the medicine and press it slightly while moving it whenever the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, for they will feel a burning like fire. As long as they feel the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. When the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Observe, and if you see the eyelid has risen as it rises during cauterization with fire or cutting - if not, reapply the medicine to the area where it hasn't taken effect and hasn't blackened until you complete your work and the eye is lifted. Then place cotton with butter on it until the burn crust falls off.
Then treat it with palm ointment or another until it heals. During the procedure, you must be extremely careful that none of the medicine falls into the eye. If the eyelid becomes loose after days and some hair grows into the eye,
Reapply the medicine to that specific loose area of the eyelid as you did initially, then treat it until it heals. This is the image of the myrtle leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, small and large, so adjust your lifting accordingly. The correct way is not hidden from those who have experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On Cauterizing the Fistula That Occurs in the Corner of the Eye.
If you have treated the fistula with what we mentioned in the classification of diseases and your treatment hasn't worked, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
Order the patient to place their head in your lap, and have an assistant hold their head firmly between your hands so it neither moves nor shakes.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or psyllium mucilage on their eyes, then heat the cautery tool which is of this shape.
It should be hollow like an eagle's feather quill on one end where the cauterization occurs, and if you wish, the other end can be perforated, or if you prefer, it can be solid like a probe, though this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then squeeze the fistula if it's open and extract the pus and dry it, or if it's not open, open it and extract its pus, then immediately place the very hot cautery on it and hold it steady until you reach the bone.
Keep your hand slightly away from the eye toward the nose during cauterization, lest your hand slip or the patient jerks and the cautery falls into the fat of the eye and damages it. If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, fine; if not, repeat with the cautery a second time if needed.
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton with butter and treat it with drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass without healing, apply the sharp, caustic medicine until the bone is exposed and strip it as will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing the fistula mentioned by some ancients: Proceed to the fistula site, cut it, then place in the cut itself a thin funnel of this shape.
Pour into it about one dirham's weight of molten lead and hold the funnel firmly and tightly, and the patient must not move at all lest the molten lead flow into their eye. You should place cotton soaked in egg white or water on the patient's eye.
For the lead burns the fistula site and heals it wonderfully. If the fistula heals with what we mentioned of cauterization and treatment, fine; if not, then it's necessary to perform nasal perforation and redirect the fistula to the nasal passage as will be mentioned in its specific place.
Chapter Eighteen.
On Cauterizing Lip Fissures.
Frequently fissures occur in the lip called the "hair-line," especially in children's lips where it often occurs. If you have treated this fissure with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment hasn't worked, then heat a small knife-like cautery of this shape.
Its hollow should be as thin as a knife, then place it hot quickly into the fissure itself until the cauterization reaches the depth of the fissure, then treat it with cerates until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing fistulas occurring in the mouth.
If swelling occurs in the base of the gums, palate, or at the roots of the molars, then becomes purulent and bursts, and the flow of pus creates a fistula, and you have treated it but the treatment was not effective, then you should heat a cautery iron to the size that fits into the fistula.
Then insert it hot into the fistula opening and hold your hand steady until the heated iron reaches its depth and end, and do this once or twice, then treat it afterward with what we mentioned of treatment until it heals, God willing.
If the discharge stops and it heals, fine; if not, then the area must be exposed and the decayed bone removed according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On cauterizing teeth and loose gums.
If the gums become loose due to moisture and the teeth become mobile, and you have treated them with medicines without success, place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the cautery iron whose illustration will come after this, after placing the tube on the tooth.
Insert the hot cautery quickly through the tube and hold your hand briefly until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth, then lift your hand, then repeat the cautery several times as needed, then have the patient fill their mouth with salt water.
They should hold it for a while then spit it out, for the loose tooth will become firm and the loose gum will tighten and the corrupt moisture will dry up.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On cauterizing tooth pain.
If tooth pain is due to cold or if there are worms in it, and treatment with medicines has not been successful, then cauterization can be done in two ways: either cautery with clarified butter or cautery with fire.
As for cautery with clarified butter, take cow's clarified butter and heat it in an iron spoon or shell, then take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, then dip it in the heated clarified butter and place it quickly on the painful tooth and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, you may dip wool or cotton in cold clarified butter and place it on the painful tooth and put the heated iron above it until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterizing it with fire, take a copper or iron tube with some thickness in its body so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth, then heat the cautery whose illustration will come and place it on the tooth itself and hold your hand until the cautery cools - do this several times.
The pain will go away either that very day or another day, and following this cauterization, the patient should fill their mouth with good clarified butter and hold it for a while then spit it out, and this is the illustration of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish and as circumstances allow, and this is the illustration of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing scrofula.
If scrofula is caused by phlegm and cold humors and does not respond to maturation by medicines, and you want quick maturation, heat the hollow cautery iron which has this illustration, with both ends open.
So the smoke can exit from the other end during cauterization, and place it hot on the swelling itself once and a second time if needed until it reaches the depth of the swelling, and if the swelling is small, make the cautery according to the size of the swelling.
Then leave it for three days and apply cotton soaked in clarified butter until what was burned by the fire goes away, then treat it with ointment and wicks until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If humors overwhelm the windpipe, especially if this occurs with coldness of temperament, the patient should first be purged with purgative medicines, then cauterize once in the hollow of the throat at the base of the larynx in the depressed area.
Be careful not to reach the larynx with the cauterization and burn only half of the skin, then cauterize another time at the joint of the neck at its last vertebra deeply, and the cautery should be nail-shaped according to the description that preceded.
Then treat it with what was previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On cauterizing lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and the patient has neither fever nor consumption, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize with two cauterizations above the collarbones in the soft, hollow, depressed areas, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cautery should be nail-shaped according to the previously shown form, and if you wish, your cauterization can be done as dots using the cautery called "the point" which was previously shown in the section about cauterizing ear pain, and the dots should be about thirty in number.
Then treat it as previously mentioned until it heals, and you can make a three-pronged cautery of this form, and the cauterization is hastened because you cauterize three burns at once, and this is the form of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated due to slippery humors, or if it doesn't stay in place when reset from its dislocation until it becomes habitual, returning then dislocating at the slightest movement as we have observed, then the dislocation should first be reduced.
Then the patient should lie on their back or on the healthy side, then lift the skin inside the armpit upward with the fingers of your left hand if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then heat the two-pronged cautery which is of this form.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the cauterization pattern will be four burns, and it can be cauterized with a three-pronged cautery making the pattern six burns, and the prongs should be as thin as a rose thorn.
And this is the form of the three-pronged cautery.
One more can be added to this number making eight burns, then apply ground antimony with salt to the cautery, then require the patient to rest and not move the limb for a time until it strengthens, and if the dislocation is upward, which rarely occurs.
Cauterize above the shoulder with either one good nail-shaped cauterization or many dot cauterizations, for the joint will strengthen, the moisture will disappear, and the patient will heal.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On cauterizing the stomach.
If cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach until it deviates from its temperament, and catarrh to it increases, and it has been treated with various treatments without success, then the patient should lie on their back and extend their legs and arms, then cauterize with three cauterizations.
One cauterization below the xiphoid process by a finger's width with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauterizations below on either side of the single cauterization so that the pattern of burns forms a triangle, and space them apart so they don't merge when they suppurate, and the depth of the cautery should be about two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and the pattern of the cauterizations should be.
Of this form and this exact measure, no more.
And if you wish, you may cauterize with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach of this form.
And the cautery used for this single cauterization should be circular in shape, of this form.
And the stomach can be cauterized with dots for those who fear this cauterization, by marking dots on the stomach with ink to the extent you want, then cauterizing with a dotted cautery, then treat it with the previously mentioned treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On cauterizing the cold liver.
If pain occurs in the liver due to cold and moisture or due to thick wind until it deviates extremely from its natural temperament, and the patient has been treated with what we mentioned in the classification without success.
Then the patient should lie on their back and mark three cauterizations with ink in this form and this exact measure on the liver below the costal cartilages where the human elbow reaches.
And the distance between each cauterization should be the width of a finger, and the cauterization should be straight along the length of the body, and do not press your hand firmly with the cautery.
And the amount you burn of the skin's thickness should be half, no more, and the patient should be standing on their feet, but if they cannot stand then they should be lying down with legs extended and arms raised, and this is the form of the cautery.
And you can cauterize these burns with the knife-shaped cautery if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and be careful not to go too deep in cauterizing lest you burn through the entire skin and burn the abdomen and reach the intestines, for the skin there is thin, so know this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On treating liver tumor by cauterization.
When an abscess occurs in the liver and you want to know whether that tumor is in the liver tissue or in its membrane, if it is in the liver tissue, the patient feels heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the liver membrane, there is severe sharpness with the pain, and if you see that physicians have failed to treat it, the patient should lie on their back, then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery iron in fire, which is the cautery that resembles a probe, and this is its form.
And cauterize it with one cauterization until the entire skin is burned and the cauterization reaches the membrane until all the pus comes out, then treat it with abscess treatment until it heals.
This type of cauterization should only be used by one who has long experience in medicine and has treated these diseases through repeated experience, only then should they proceed with such work, though in my opinion, leaving it alone is better.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On cauterizing pleurisy.
The ancients mentioned cauterization with birthwort roots for cold pleurisy in this manner: take one root of the dry long birthwort, the longest you can find, about the thickness of a finger, then dip it in oil and light it in fire.
Then make one cauterization between where the collarbone meets the neck, and two small cauterizations slightly below the jugular veins, angled toward the area under the jaw, and two large cauterizations above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
And also two cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly angled backward, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest, another above the stomach, and three cauterizations from behind - one between the shoulder blades and two on the sides of the spine below the cauterization that is between the shoulders.
You should not press deeply with the cauterization, but rather keep it superficial on the skin as a warming; some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery like a probe, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reached the tumor itself.
And extract the pus as we mentioned in liver tumor, but in this puncturing by cauterization there is risk: either the patient dies immediately or a permanent fistula develops in the area with no cure.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If you have treated the spleen disease with what we mentioned of treatment in the classification and your treatment wasn't successful, then cauterization for it is done in three ways, all of them correct; one of them is to make three or four cauterizations lined up along the length of the spleen.
In the form of liver cauterizations which we previously described, with the distance between each cauterization being about the thickness of a finger or slightly more, and the form of the cautery should be the same as we mentioned for liver cauterization, and don't press deeply with the cauterization, and the patient should be lying on their back.
The other approach is at the elbow, and you lift the skin opposite to the spleen where the patient's left elbow ends, and you lift the skin opposite to the spleen where the patient's elbow ends, and your lifting of the skin should be across the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the two heated skewers until they penetrate the skin from the other side, then remove the cautery so there will be four cauterizations, and if you wish you may cauterize with the other cautery that has three skewers.
Then treat the cauterized area after letting it discharge pus for many days, as this is more effective than all the previously mentioned treatments.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization only benefits especially in ascitic dropsy; if you have treated the patient with dropsy using the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification and your treatment wasn't successful, then you should make four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.
And another cauterization on the liver and one on the spleen and two behind his back between the vertebrae, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach, and the depth of cauterization should be about the thickness of the skin, then leave the cauterization open to discharge pus for a long time.
And don't leave the patient without treatment after cauterization with what is necessary to combine both approaches for faster healing, and the form of the cautery used for the back should be nail-shaped as previously illustrated, and the one used for the back should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On Cauterizing the Feet and Legs.
When they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow fluid, one should cauterize on the top of the foot in the depression between the little toe and ring toe.
Keep your hand steady with the cautery and do not twist it, then lift your hand and do not repeat it at all, for the yellow fluid will seep out, and the cautery should be in this form.
Then cauterize the legs with two burns on each leg, using the knife-like end of the cautery, making the cauterization along the length of the leg - one below the knee and another lower near the middle of the leg - and two burns on each thigh.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time so the fluid seeps out, then treat it with the rest of what we mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On Cauterizing for Diarrhea.
When diarrhea is from cold and moisture until it weakens the retaining and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and this has been treated with various treatments without cure, and you see the patient can tolerate cauterization and has sufficient strength, then cauterize them with a large burn on their stomach.
As previously mentioned in stomach cauterization with the circular cautery, and four small burns around the navel with the fine nail-like cautery, and one large burn or two burns on the lower back above the coccyx.
If you see abundant moisture and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize once on the pubic area and once on each flank, and you might add two small burns on the stomach near the large one, for it is a successful treatment that will not fail to benefit, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On Cauterizing Hemorrhoids of the Anus.
When there are chronic multiple hemorrhoids in the anus, or a single one, caused by thick cold humors or corrupt moistures, and they have been treated with what we mentioned in the classification without success, then cauterize the patient with three burns on the lower vertebrae slightly below the table in a triangular pattern.
And one burn two fingers' width below the navel, and if you determine that their stomach has become cold and their food is not digesting, and you see their face is swollen, then cauterize them with a large burn on the stomach as previously mentioned, and a burn on their liver.
And another on their spleen with a nail-like cautery, and leave the cauterization open for a time, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On Cauterizing Warts.
After cutting them, when you have cut the wart, heat the probe-like cautery then insert it hot into the cut wart itself and keep your hand steady until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vessel from which blood flows, doing this once or twice.
If there are many warts, cauterize each one as we described, then treat them with suitable ointments until they heal, and if you also make a large cauterization on the lower back, it will be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On Cauterizing Fistulas That Occur in the Anus and Its Surroundings.
If the patient does not accept the incision and procedure we described in its place and is afraid of that, sometimes it can be cured by cauterization. When someone develops a fistula and it becomes chronic, with pus and corrupt fluids flowing from it, first you should probe it with a thin probe.
Then know the extent of its depth with the probe, then heat the probe-like cautery and insert it hot into the fistula itself, following the straight path of the fistula's depth to the extent the probe entered, and repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt tissues are burned, once or twice or thrice as needed.
And be careful not to burn any nerves if present there, or large vessels, and if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine.
Be careful of all these areas, and only do this when the fistula is in a fleshy area and you determine it is not penetrating, then treat the area until it heals. If the area seals and the discharge stops and remains so for a time, know that it has healed completely.
And if the discharge does not stop, know that it is penetrating or has corrupt bone in its depth or something similar that will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On Cauterization of the Kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or thick wind, and because of this the patient's sexual function decreases, then you should cauterize on the loins over the kidneys themselves, one cauterization on each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery that was previously mentioned, and sometimes we cauterize a third time in the same area so there are three cauterizations in a row, which is more effective in benefit.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On Cauterization of the Bladder.
If weakness and laxity occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture until the patient cannot hold urine, then cauterize once below the navel over the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and once to the right of the navel and another to its left.
The cauterization after burning should be on each side about the size of a thumb joint, and cauterize once in the lower back or twice if you need that, and the cautery should be nail-shaped as mentioned before.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On Cauterization of the Uterus.
If matter occurs in the uterus from cold and moisture, and because of this conception is prevented and her menstruation is corrupted and its flow is difficult, or pain occurs when it comes, then you should make three cauterizations around the navel as we mentioned in the cauterization of the bladder.
And one cauterization on the lower back below the spine, or two, and the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter Forty.
On Cauterization of Hip Dislocation.
Mucous fluids may flow to the hip socket, causing it to leave its position, and its sign is that the leg becomes longer than the other when you compare them to each other, and you find emptiness in the location of the dislocation, so you should cauterize the patient on the hip socket itself with a circular-like cauterization.
After marking with ink around the socket as it circles so the socket itself falls in the middle of the circle, and the cautery should be the one whose image was previously shown in stomach cauterization, and if this cautery is not available to you, then make three cauterizations with the large olive-shaped cautery.
And make the cauterization deep enough for the thickness of the entire skin, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-One.
On Cauterization of the Sciatic Nerve.
If pain occurs in the hip socket and its cause is cold and moisture, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment was not effective and it became chronic, then the patient should be purged of thick humors with stinking pills or aloe pills and the like.
Then cauterize him, and the method of cauterization in this case is of two types: either cauterization with burning medicines or cauterization with fire, and cauterization with fire can be done in many ways, one of which is to cauterize three triangular cauterizations on the hip socket itself in this pattern.
Make them appropriately deep, and the distance between each cauterization should be about the thickness of a finger, and the cautery should be olive-shaped, and sometimes a cauterization is made in the middle on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations, and if you wish, you can cauterize with the circle that was previously mentioned in the cauterization of hip dislocation as a single cauterization.
So that the circle encompasses the entire hip and burns the thickness of the entire skin. This is the description of cauterization in sciatica when the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, then make two cauterizations on the thigh at the location where the patient indicates pain, and one cauterization above the heel tendon by four fingers slightly to the lateral side, and the cautery should be knife-shaped and the depth of the cauterization should be only as deep as the thickness of the skin.
And if he indicates that the pain extends toward the toes, then cauterize where he indicates with the point cautery three or four times or more if needed, and if he indicates pain below the knee toward the leg, then cauterize there with one knife-shaped cauterization.
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to reach with the burning to the point where you burn a major nerve or artery, as this would cause serious harm or disability to the patient.
And I have witnessed one and two of those who were cauterized above the heel tendon and the cauterization was excessive, so the leg became infected until the infection reached the foot and it all perforated and the entire leg was corrupted, then diarrhea and death occurred after that. If the pain is in both sides, cauterize them both in exactly this manner.
And some scholars among the wise men have mentioned regarding hip cauterization a cauterization whose description is as follows: make something like a cup from iron with its diameter being half a span, and at its mouth it should be as thick as a date pit or slightly less, and inside that cup is another cup and a third cup.
The distance between each cup should be about the size of a thumb joint, and the cups should be open from both sides, with a height of about one or two joints, and they should have an iron handle firmly fixed into the cups, and this is its form.
Then heat it in fire until it becomes red and sparks fly, then place it on the hip joint while the patient is leaning on their healthy side, and cauterize three circular burns at once, then leave it for three days and dress it with ghee and leave the wound open for many days.
The author of this book says: We rarely used this type of cauterization due to its ugliness and frightening appearance, and because we rarely find anyone who can endure it, although it is among the best cauterizations for those who can bear it and when applied to the correct spot.
As for cauterization with burning medicines, it is done by making two rings like the ones used for door latches, made of copper or iron.
Their edges should be raised about two joints or so, with a space between them about the thickness of a finger, and they should be open at both top and bottom, held together in this form.
Then lower it onto the hip joint while the patient lies on their healthy side, and grip firmly with your hand, then pour slightly heated caustic water between the two circles and hold it for about an hour in the sand clock, and the patient must endure its sting and burn, for it burns like fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe all the caustic water from the hip with fresh water, then leave it for three days and apply ghee until the burn blackness disappears, and leave it for days to discharge pus, for this is more beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold that holds water just as you did with the hip. This is the description of the caustic water, which I have recorded in the treatise on medicine preparation.
Take one part each of potash and unslaked lime, grind them and put them in a new pot with a single small hole pierced in its bottom, just large enough to insert a probe, and place another glazed pot under the bottom of the first pot.
Pour enough fresh water over the potash and lime to cover them by a finger's width after pressing them well with your hand, and leave the pot until the caustic water drains into the lower glazed pot, then collect all that water and pour it over fresh lime and potash again.
It will then become very strong in its caustic effect, useful in many medical procedures and in cauterizing various body parts as it acts exactly like fire. Among the medicines used to cauterize the hip are also thapsia, cashew honey, and lime mixed with soap as liniments.
Galen related a story about one of the ancients' treatment for hip pain and sciatica, greatly emphasizing its importance and claiming it needed no other treatment and would cure in a single application.
So much so that sometimes a patient would be carried into the bath and leave cured. It involves taking fresh harmel plant, or if unavailable, recent dried harmel, grinding it well with some fat and placing it on the hip where the pain is, or on the leg or thigh.
Bind it and leave it for about three hours or until the patient feels the burning sensation subside, then enter them into the bath. When their body becomes moist, put them in the pool, and the pain will go away and heal, God willing. If it doesn't heal, reapply the compress after ten days.
It will heal, God willing. Know that no one should use cauterization with these medicines except after purging the body. Dioscorides mentioned that goat droppings when used to cauterize sciatica are beneficial.
The cauterization is done in this manner: Take wool soaked in old oil and place it on the deep spot between the thumb and forearm, closer to the forearm, then take a dry goat dropping.
Ignite it with fire until it becomes like coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes, then take another and continue doing this until the sensation reaches through the upper arm to the hip and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called dung cauterization.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On cauterizing back pain.
Back pain occurs from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive discharge, or similar causes, and it can be from the flow of cold, wet matter, and cauterization is only applicable in this type alone.
After purging the patient with stinking pills and the like, for pain caused by the flow of cold matter, you should cauterize their back where the pain is in three rows across the width of the area itself, after marking the location with ink, with five cauterizations or more in each row depending on what you see of the patient's tolerance and strength.
The cauterization should be done with a dot cautery, and if you wish, you can cauterize three or four times with a medium-sized nail cautery of this shape.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a hump.
This condition often occurs in young children, and the sign of its beginning in the child is that they experience shortness of breath when standing and moving, and you find in their lower vertebrae a protruding vertebra that stands out from the rest.
When you see this and want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery of this shape.
So that the cauterization covers each side of the vertebra evenly, and if you wish, you can cauterize around the vertebra with a dot cautery in two or three rows, with the dots close to each other, then treat the area until it heals as we mentioned.
Be careful not to use cauterization in humps caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
When joint pains are caused by cold humors flowing to any part of the body, and when the pains occur in the feet, doctors typically call this gout specifically.
If cold-caused gout is treated with the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification and the pains do not go away, then cauterization will remove them by cauterizing around the foot joint with many cauterizations after purging, using a medium-sized olive-shaped cautery of this shape.
If you need to make dots on the top of the foot, do so with a dot cautery, and if the pains rise to the knees or other joints, which often happens, cauterize each knee with three or four cauterizations on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery.
If more cauterization than this is needed, do it but don't press your hand deeply with the cautery - just to the thickness of the skin only, and if the pains rise to the hips or back, use what we mentioned about cauterization in its chapter.
If the pains are in the hands only, make dots around the forearms in two circular rows, and if the pains remain in the fingers, make a dot on each knuckle and on the metacarpus, and if the pains rise after days to the elbows or shoulders.
Cauterize them from each side, and the patient should not be without good management and taking medicines, for if they improve their diet and purge the phlegm, they will heal with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On cauterizing hernias.
If a hernia occurs in the groin and some intestine and omentum descend to the testicle, and this is recent and new, you should order the patient to stop eating that day and to use laxatives to move the stool from their bowels.
Then they should lie on their back before you, and you order them to hold their breath until the omentum or intestine protrudes, then return it with your finger, then mark with ink below the hernia on the pubic bone a mark resembling a half-circle with its ends pointing toward the upper body.
Then heat a cautery of this shape.
Until it becomes white and throws sparks, then return the intestine or omentum to the cavity, then have an assistant place his hand on the spot so the intestine doesn't protrude, and you have spread the patient's legs and placed a pillow under them, and another assistant ties their legs.
And another on their chest holding their hands, then lower the cautery onto the mark itself with your hand holding the cautery upright and steady, and hold it until you reach the bone or repeat it again if you didn't reach the bone with the first attempt.
And be very careful to prevent intestinal protrusion during cauterization lest you burn it, which would cause either death or great affliction for the patient. Know that if your cauterization doesn't reach the bone, your procedure won't succeed. The cautery iron for children should be delicate according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with clarified butter until the fire's scab falls off, then treat it with other ointments until it heals. The patient should lie on their back for forty days until the wound closes.
Their diet during treatment should be what softens their bowels, lest the intestine protrudes during straining and defecation. Then when they want to stand after forty days, use a firm bandage and maintain it for another forty days, and reduce strain, fullness from food and drink, and loud shouting.
For if this regimen is followed thus, complete healing will occur, God willing. I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing. As for hernias that occur elsewhere in the abdomen and are beginning, if you want to prevent its increase, cauterize the hernia with a circular cauterization according to its size.
The amount of skin you burn should be about two-thirds of it, then treat it as we mentioned, and it will not increase, God willing. Some ancients have mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery of this shape.
After marking the hernia with ink, place the horizontal line at the upper side of the hernia and the other line below, and lower your hand in the middle with a single nail-shaped cauterization. The first cauterization method is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On Cauterizing Sprains.
When pain occurs in some limbs from a fall or blow and that pain persists for a long time and treatment with medicines doesn't succeed, it should be cauterized with a point cautery, and the cauterization of each limb should be according to its size, whether large or small, and its weakness or strength.
If the pain and sprain are established in it, then if it heals from the first cauterization, good; if not, repeat the cauterization, because it is the nature of these pains to move from the limb to what's near it, so you should follow them with cauterization until the patient heals.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On Cauterizing Leprosy.
As for lepers, they benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that comes from putrefied phlegm and black bile.
When you want to cauterize it, observe: if the leprosy is beginning and you've treated it as we mentioned in the classification, and it hasn't diminished or stopped, and you fear for the patient that corruption will overtake their entire temperament, then cauterize five cauterizations on the head.
One in the known middle of the head, the second lower toward the forehead at the hairline, two on the temples, and one behind on the hollow of the nape, and press your hand with the cautery a little until it affects the bone slightly.
And scales fall from it to facilitate the release of thick vapors from it, and also cauterize once on the spleen itself as previously mentioned. If the leprosy has persisted in the patient and appeared clearly, you should make these cauterizations we mentioned in the head.
And one cauterization on the tip of the nose, two on the cheeks, two on the vertebrae of the neck, six on the vertebrae of the back, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the tail, another above it on the table itself, and two on the hips, one on each hip.
And two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the chest bones, and cauterize each joint of their fingers and toes with one cauterization, and on each ankle of their feet and wrists of their hands.
And be careful of the nerve that's on the back of the ankles lest you burn them. And cauterize once on the pubic bone, another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver. Know that the more cauterization you add, the more beneficial and effective it will be.
Know that the patient doesn't feel the pain of cauterization as a healthy person would because their body has become numb. The cautery irons should be in size according to the limbs and joints as previously mentioned in the descriptions of the irons.
Then treat the cauterization with bitter vetch flour with honey and other treatments until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On cauterizing numbness: When a body part becomes numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and compresses but does not heal, then cauterize the numb part itself with cauterizations according to what the size of the organ deserves, whether large or small, and let your cauterization penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals, and sometimes numbness that occurs in the hand and foot is cauterized in the vertebrae of the back at the exit point of the nerve that moves that organ, and the numbness disappears.
And none should attempt this except one who is knowledgeable in anatomy and the exit points of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On cauterizing vitiligo.
When vitiligo persists and no medical treatment works for it, then cauterize it with a cauterization that goes slightly deep according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness goes away and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour with rose oil and plantain leaves and pigeon blood or swallow blood, one part of each, mix everything and apply it on a cloth and keep it on the area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On cauterizing cancer.
When cancer is in its early stages and you want to stop it, cauterize around it with a circular cautery as it goes around, and some wise men have mentioned cauterizing intensely in its center, but I don't recommend this as I expect it to ulcerate, and I have witnessed this multiple times.
The correct approach is to cauterize around it in a circle as we said or with multiple cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On cauterizing abscess.
When someone develops an abscess that is slow to mature, either due to the causative excess or due to the patient's age if they are elderly with little blood, or due to the season, and you want to hasten the maturation of the abscess, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations in a dotted pattern.
Then leave it, for it will quickly mature, and if you want to lance it with cautery, heat the cautery tool of this shape.
And insert it in the center of the abscess until it penetrates the skin, and let the cauterization be toward the bottom to facilitate pus drainage, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On cauterizing gangrene.
Gangrene is corruption that spreads in the organ and consumes it as fire consumes dry wood, so if you see gangrene in a location that can tolerate cauterization by fire, heat many nail-shaped cauteries, both small and large, according to what is suitable for that location where the gangrene is.
Then cauterize it from all sides until all the corruption is eliminated and nothing remains of it at all, then leave it for three days and apply ground sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scab and all the corruption falls off.
Then treat it with flesh-growing ointments, and if after three days you see that the flesh is growing healthily without corruption, fine, otherwise repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas, and gangrene can be treated with caustic medicine.
For it serves the purpose of fire, working faster, and I have mentioned its treatment with caustic medicine in the classification, so take it from there when you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted corns.
Often this condition occurs in the soles of the feet and it is something rough that causes pain to the foot, and cauterization for it is of two types: either cauterization by fire or cauterization by caustic water.
As for cauterization by fire, it is to heat the hollow cautery that resembles a vulture's feather, made of iron according to what surrounds the corn from all sides, and it should be thin-edged, then lower it hot onto the corn, then rotate your hand with the cautery around the corn until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn.
And leave it for three days until it starts to suppurate, then dress it with wild mallow pounded with salt and leave the dressing on it overnight, for it will be uprooted from its roots, then treat the wound site with flesh-growing ointment until it heals, and if the corns are not inverted.
And often they occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you should take a tube of copper or iron or vulture's feather and lower it onto the corn or wart, then pour a small amount of caustic water into the tube.
Hold your hand while rotating it with slight pressure from your hand so that the edge of the tube affects the base of the nail, allowing the sharp water to find its way to penetrate to the base of the nail, and the patient should endure the sting of the sharp water for a while.
Then leave it, for the nail will be uprooted with its roots. Do this one by one until you have treated all of them in the body, then treat their sites after removal with flesh-growing ointments.
Chapter Fifty-Four.
On Cauterizing Shivers.
If someone experiences shivers from cold in the nerves or from quartan fever or otherwise, you should cauterize them with four or five cauterizations on the vertebrae of the back, with a cauterization between each vertebra, and one cauterization on their chest.
And one cauterization on their stomach with the olive-shaped cautery, for the shivers will calm and the cold illness will quickly mature.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
On Cauterizing Pustules Occurring in the Body.
Ugly pustules may appear in the body from cold, thick, corrupt matter, so at their first appearance, you should cauterize each pustule's head with a gentle cauterization using a myrtle stick whose tip has been ignited by fire, or with long birthwort root, or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Boils can be cauterized at their first eruption in this manner, so they won't increase, and the causing excess will disperse, and the patient will recover - though this should only be done after bleeding the patient.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
On Cauterizing Bleeding That Occurs When Cutting an Artery.
Often bleeding occurs from an artery that has been cut during an external wound, or when cutting open a tumor, or cauterizing a limb, and similar cases, making it difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the mouth of the artery and press it firmly until the blood is contained under your finger and nothing comes out, then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large depending on the wound and the location where the artery has burst, and place the cautery directly on the vessel after quickly removing your finger, and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If blood spurts when you lift your finger from the artery's mouth and extinguishes the cautery, quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire, and continue doing this one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn any nerve that might be there, lest you cause another affliction for the patient, and know that when an artery bleeds, stopping it is not possible, especially if the artery is large, except by one of four ways: either by cauterization as we said, or by cutting it if it hasn't been cut completely.
For if it is cut, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop; or it can be tied firmly with threads; or medications that stop bleeding can be applied along with firm bandaging with compresses.
As for those who try to stop it with a bandage or by binding with rags or applying burning substances and the like, it will never stop by these means except rarely, and if this happens to someone and no physician or medicine is present, they should immediately place their index finger on the wound opening itself as we described.
And press it very firmly until the blood is contained, and pour extremely cold water continuously over the wound and on the artery while the finger remains in place, until the blood congeals, thickens, and stops, and during this time consider what is needed in terms of cauterization or medication.
Book Two.
On Incision, Lancing, Bloodletting, Wounds, and Similar Matters.
Khalaf said: We have mentioned in the first book every disease in which cauterization by fire and burning medicine is suitable, along with its causes, reasons, instruments, and forms of cauteries, and I arranged it in chapters from horn to foot.
And I will follow in this book the exact same approach to make it easy for the student to find what they seek.
Before I begin with that, you should know, my sons, that this book contains more risk than what was in the first book on cauterization.
Therefore, greater caution is needed in this matter, as work in this field often involves the loss of blood which sustains life, whether through opening a vein, incising a tumor, draining an abscess, treating a wound, removing an arrow, cutting for bladder stones, and similar procedures which all carry risk and fear, and in many cases result in death.
I advise you against falling into matters of uncertainty, for in this craft you will encounter various types of people with different ailments. Among them are those who have grown weary of their illness and care not for death.
Due to the severity of their illness and long suffering, and the disease shows signs indicating death. And among them are those who offer you their wealth and would enrich you hoping for health, while their disease is fatal. You should not assist anyone who comes to you with these characteristics at all.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with any of this except with certain knowledge that confirms to you a favorable outcome, and in all your treatment of patients, employ prognosis and warning about what will lead to safety.
For in this you will find help in gaining praise, glory, remembrance, and commendation. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance and not deprive you of correctness and success, for that is in His hands, there is no god but He.
I have arranged this chapter in sections as previously done in the chapter on cauterization, from horn to foot, to make it easier for you to find what you want from it, God willing.
Chapter One.
On treating water that collects in children's heads.
This ailment frequently occurs in children at birth when the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness, and it may also occur from an unknown hidden cause.
I have not seen this condition in anyone but children, and all whom I saw among them died quickly, therefore I saw fit to abandon treating it. Indeed, I saw among them a boy whose head was filled with water and the head grew larger every day.
Until the boy could not sit up by himself due to the size of his head, and the moisture kept increasing until he perished.
This moisture either collects between the skin and bone or collects under the bone on the membrane, and the procedure for this, if the moisture is between the skin and bone and the swelling is small, is to make a single transverse incision in the middle of the head, with the length of the incision about two knots until the moisture drains, and this is the form of the lancet.
If the moisture is more and the swelling greater, make two intersecting incisions in this form:
If the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the head's sutures open from all sides and the water sinks when you press it with your hand inward, and this is not hidden from you, you should make three incisions in the middle of the head in this form.
After the incision, remove all the moisture, then bind the incisions with cloths and pads, then dress it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day, then undo the bandage and treat the wound with wicks and ointments, and do not cease binding the head moderately, and feed the patient every dry food with little moisture.
Until the limb strengthens and heals, and another description of the incision is to look where the swelling appears most prominent and where water collects, for it may be more in the back of the head or in its front or on the right or on the left.
Then aim your incision where the swelling and water collection appears to you, and make the incision as you can, and be careful not to cut an artery causing bleeding that would lead to the patient's death from that bleeding along with the draining of moisture.
Chapter Two.
Cutting of the two arteries behind the ears known as the pulsating ones.
When someone suffers from acute catarrh in the eyes or chest that becomes chronic and medicine does not help, the most effective treatment is cutting these two arteries.
If you want to cut them, you should first shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to make the artery visible, then tighten the patient's neck with their excess garment, then look for where the vessel pulsates. Their locations are in the two depressed areas behind the ears, and they are rarely hidden except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with the sharp scalpel down to the bone, doing this across the head. If you wish, you can insert the scalpel from under the artery and pull it upward while cutting, and the length of the cut should be about two fingers pressed together.
When the vessel is cut, the blood will emerge in a pulsating manner, leaping forward in regular spurts. If the artery is not visible to touch, you should measure three fingers' width from the ear, then mark with ink and cut to the bone. What you should do is...
Release about six ounces of blood on average, though sometimes more or less depending on what you observe of the patient's strength and the fullness of their arteries. Then examine the wound, and if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it away.
To prevent hot inflammation, pack the wound with a linen wick, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On Extracting the Arteries in the Temples.
When a person suffers from chronic migraine or acute catarrh due to sharp humors and heat in the temple muscles, or severe chronic headache and the like, and various medical treatments have been tried without success, we have found success in these diseases by extracting the arteries from the temples or cauterizing them as we described.
The procedure for extraction is to shave the hair at the temples and locate the visible artery in the temple, which you can identify by its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in rare individuals.
Or during severe cold. If it's hidden from you, have the patient tighten their neck with their excess garment, then you rub the area with a cloth or apply hot water compresses until the artery becomes clearly and distinctly visible.
Then take the scalpel which is of this form.
Then carefully separate the skin until you reach the artery, then insert a hook and pull it upward until you extract it from the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it from all sides. If the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook.
Then cut off a portion of it sufficient for its ends to separate and contract without causing hemorrhage, for if it is not severed and cut, the blood will not stop at all. Then drain between three to six ounces of blood.
If the artery is large, you should tie it in two places with strong doubled thread, either silk or lute strings so that rot doesn't set in before the wound heals, which would cause bleeding.
Then cut the excess between the two ties, doing this either immediately or after some time. If you prefer to cauterize it to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until its ends are severed, this serves the same purpose or better, as we said.
Unless the patient has fever or hot temperament, because cauterization helps eliminate fluids and thus becomes more beneficial. After extracting the arteries, the area should be packed with old cotton, firm pads placed over it, and after releasing, treated with dry medications that grow flesh and with wicks until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding occurs during your procedure from the artery, hasten to cut it either by cauterization or by filling the area with vitriol and pressing with your hand until the blood stops. If none of these are available to you, place your finger until the blood clots.
Pour very cold water on the area until the intensity subsides and bind it as necessary. What is lighter and easier than extracting the artery is to cauterize the vessel with this two-bladed cautery after marking the spots with ink.
Lower it very hot until it reaches the bone and cuts the vessel in two places so that its ends separate, for it will never heal with this cauterization. This is the form of the cautery.
The two blades should be sharp like small scissors but much less sharp than a knife, because if they were as sharp as knives, they would cool quickly and not cut the flesh rapidly. When they have some thickness, they retain the heat of the fire.
And cut the flesh quickly. This procedure is better than all others and lighter and easier. The distance between the two blades should be about the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four.
On treating the continuous flow of hot tears to the eyes.
When tears are continuous and their flow comes from the vessels on the outside of the skull, and no medical treatment with medicines helps, and you see the patient's face has reddened.
And they feel in their forehead a crawling sensation like ants, and their eyes are emaciated and moist, their eyelashes have eroded and their eyelids are irritated from the sharpness of tears, so the ancients were compelled to treat it with this procedure which they call treatment by the sword, which is to order the patient to shave the hair on their forehead.
Then make three parallel incisions along the length of the forehead, with each incision being about two fingers long, the first incision parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second slightly away from the movement of the temple muscle, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides and keep your hand away from the jaw connection, and the distance between each incision should be three fingers pressed together, and have prepared pieces of sponge or many dry cloths ready to absorb the blood.
Then insert the double-edged scalpel which is of this form.
From the incision near the temple to the middle incision, and use it to separate all the skin between the two incisions along with the membrane on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, then remove this scalpel.
And insert into the first incision another tool called a knife that is sharp on one side and smooth on the other side, and this is its form:.
And position its sharp side upward toward the flesh attached to the skin and its smooth side toward the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision, and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without the cutting reaching the outer skin.
Then do the same from the middle incision to the other incision, and after a moderate amount of blood flows, squeeze the areas to remove clotted blood, then place in each incision a wick of old cotton and put on it a compress that has been moistened with wine and oil or vinegar and oil.
To prevent hot inflammation, and on the third day remove the bandage and apply frequent fomentation with lukewarm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and whatever else you treat wounds with until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On treating tears and catarrhs flowing to the eyes from inside the head.
When someone experiences frequent, sharp, burning catarrhs continuously, and you see their eyes emaciated and small, with weakened vision and ulcerated eyelids, and their eyelashes have fallen out.
And there is a sharp, painful ache in the depth of the head and consecutive sneezing, know from these symptoms that these substances and catarrhs come from many deep vessels, and the best treatment for them is this treatment, which is to order the patient to shave their forehead then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead.
Or slightly higher across, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision be to the bone, and keep your hand away from the moving temple muscles used in chewing until when the bone is exposed and all blood is absorbed with the sponge.
Then separate between the lips of the incision with old cotton or linen wicks, then bind from above with compresses and soak the compresses with wine and oil to prevent hot inflammation, and when you remove them and see that the hot inflammation has decreased, you should scrape the bone until flesh begins to grow in it.
Then treat it with the drying regimen that grows flesh, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony and preparing from them an ointment and using it for flesh growth in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
On treating what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is one of four types: either mineral stone or stone-like materials such as iron and glass, or plant seeds like chickpeas and date pits and similar things, or liquid substances like water and vinegar and the like.
And either animals, so when a pebble or something similar falls into the ear that doesn't expand in the ear, face the ear toward the sun and if you see the pebble, drop in some violet oil or sesame oil, then try to remove it by moving the head or causing sneezing with hellebore.
Block the nostrils when the sneeze comes after placing a ring of rags or wool around the ear and pull the ear upward, as it often comes out with this treatment. If it doesn't come out, then try to remove it with the fine forceps that looks like this.
If it comes out with the forceps, good, but if not then try to remove it with a fine blunt hook with slight curvature. If it doesn't come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole carefully.
Seal around the tube with wax softened with oil so there is no path for air except through the tube, then draw strongly with your breath and it often comes out this way. If it doesn't come out with what we described, then take a small amount of Nabataean gum or prepared bird-lime and put it on the end of the probe.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, insert it gently into the ear hole after drying the ear of moisture. If it doesn't come out with all we described, then proceed to make an incision before inflammation or spasm occurs.
The method of incision is to first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and remove blood according to their strength, then seat the patient before you and turn their ear upward and make a small crescent-shaped incision at the base of the ear near the lobe in the depressed area.
Make the incision crescent-shaped until you reach the pebble, then extract it with whatever instruments possible, then stitch the incision immediately and quickly and treat it until it heals.
As for if the thing that fell in the ear is one of the seeds that swells and expands, try to remove it with what we mentioned. If it doesn't come out, then take a thin, fine lancet of this shape.
Try to cut that type of seed that has fallen into the ear, and you should only do this when you are certain that the seed has been moistened by the ear's vapor until you can break it into many small pieces, then remove them with the blunt hook or fine forceps or by suction.
As we mentioned, this makes their removal easier. As for water that has entered the ear, the patient should first use hellebore to induce sneezing while filling their ear with some old cotton and lying on the side of the ear with water in it, and if it comes out this way.
If not, then take many stones the length of fingers, thin and smooth, warm them slightly with fire, and have the patient insert one into their ear hole and hop on one leg from that side and strike another stone against the stone in the ear.
Keep doing this stone by stone until all the water comes out. The water can also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather and inserting one end into the ear and lighting the other end with fire until most of it burns, then use another feather.
Do this several times until all the water comes out, or draw it out with the tube as previously mentioned for the pebble. As for removing animals that have entered it, observe - if it is small-bodied like a flea or similar, treat it as mentioned in the classification and as for.
If its body is large and visible to the senses, try to remove it with forceps and hooks - it is easier than all other things that get stuck in the ear. As for removing worms that develop in the ear, if you have treated them with what we mentioned in the classification in the chapter on drops and your treatment wasn't successful.
You should look at the ear in the sun, and if any worms appear to you, remove them with forceps or fine hooks. If none appear to you, then take a tube that looks like this.
Narrow at the bottom, wide at the top, insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with it. Do this several times until all the worms come out. If they don't respond to extraction, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned to you regarding the stone.
If they don't come out with what we mentioned, then use the drops that I mentioned which the ancients have tried for killing worms. You will find this in the treatise on drops. Pour the oils and medicines into the ear using this instrument, and this is its image:
As you see, make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, wide at the top. If you wish, the plunger inside the tube can be made of fitted copper, or if you prefer, take a probe and wrap cotton tightly around its tip.
Then pour the oil, extract, or whatever medicine you want into the tube while it's in the ear, then insert the cotton-tipped probe from above and press with your hand moderately until the oil is pushed into the ear canal and the patient feels it.
The liquid you pour into the ear should be slightly warmed by fire. Beware of putting anything too cold or too hot into it, as the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven
On treating blockage occurring in the ear.
Some children are born from their mothers' wombs with their ear canals not perforated.
Some people also develop blockage in the ear canal from wounds or flesh growing in it, and this blockage may be deep in the ear canal where sight cannot reach it.
It may also occur closer to the outer opening of the hole where sight can reach it. That which occurs deep in the ear and cannot be seen is in most cases difficult to cure, while that which can be seen should be treated by placing the patient's ear in the sun.
Look into it, and if you see the blockage clearly, open it with a fine scalpel of this form:
Its tip should have some width, slightly sharpened on one side, while the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to harm the ear. If the blockage is from flesh that has grown in the ear canal, hold it with a fine hook and cut it very gently until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep in the ear, take a smooth fine probe, warm it slightly in fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the blockage, along with what the patient experiences of hearing heaviness, attempt to lance it gently.
Be careful not to wound the ear nerve, then place in the ear a wick sized according to the width of the hole, having smeared it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for days until you are safe from the wound healing closed, or take a wick, moisten it with water and sprinkle ground vitriol on it.
Use this, and if you see the ear has become inflamed with hot swelling, you should remove the wick and replace it with another wick that has been smeared with cerotum made with rose oil until the hot swelling subsides, then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use the rest of the treatment that stops bleeding mentioned in the treatise on drops.
Chapter Eight
On treating warts that occur on the eyelids.
These warts that occur on the eyelids may be moist or dry. You should hold them with forceps or a hook and cut them from their roots with a scalpel, then apply ground vitriol to the spot.
If they bleed, cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cautery. Cauterization after cutting is better, and often they return if any of their roots remain, but when cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter Nine
On treating hail-like formations occurring in the eyelids.
Often something occurs in the eyelids that resembles hail in its hardness and solidity.
That is why it is called hail, and it is an accumulation of thick fluid in the upper and lower eyelid. The procedure for it is to examine, and if the hailstone is protruding on the outer eyelid and moves in all directions, its matter is simple: make a horizontal incision on it.
Then gently separate it from all sides until it comes free, then hook it with the hook and cut it out. If you cannot cut it except by penetrating through the eyelid with the cut, this will not harm the patient at all. If the incision is large, close it with stitches and treat it until it heals."
If it is small, there is no concern for you about it, as the ointment will heal and bind it. If the cold growth is inclined toward the inside of the eyelid toward the inner surface, then turn the eyelid over and catch the growth with a hook without needing to make an incision, and cut it off from all sides.
If you penetrate the eyelid with the cut, it will not cause any harm. Then wash the eye after cutting the growth with salt water and treat the area with what binds until the patient is cured.
Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of the fatty tumor that occurs in the eyelid.
The fatty tumor is a mass of fat that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it occurs most often in children. It weighs down their eyes and causes them to have discharge in the early morning, and they cannot look at sunlight.
Because tears come to them quickly.
Therefore, you see them always leaning on their faces and sleeping on them, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist and swollen, and the protrusion of the fatty tumor is visible to the eye. When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the fatty tumor between them. The procedure is to have the patient place their head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare from it a wick, and make from that wick a circle of sufficient size to surround the fatty tumor from all sides, then place it on it and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the fatty tumor in the center of the circle.
Then make an incision in the center of that moisture with the thin scalpel, a transverse incision that should not be larger than the incision made in bloodletting. As for depth, you should cut through all the skin until you reach the fatty tumor.
In most cases, the fatty tumor will protrude from the incision like a piece of white fat, so pull it out with a cloth you have wrapped between your fingers while rotating your hand right and left until it is removed. Be careful not to enlarge the incision lest the scalpel reach the eye and harm it.
If the fatty tumor does not appear at the first incision, you should carefully increase the incision slightly until the fatty tumor protrudes, then pull it as we said. Then dip cloths in vinegar and water and place them on the area and bind it with a pad. Some people grind salt.
And place it inside the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treat it until it heals. If hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing dressings until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of eyelid lifting.
When extra eyelashes grow in the eyelid outside the natural course beneath the natural eyelashes and become chronic, they harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, eyelid laxity, whiteness, and thickness until this becomes a cause for eye failure.
Eyelid lifting is done in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or with sharp medicine as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or the lifting may be done by cutting and suturing, or with reed as I will mention.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid over with your left hand. If it turns over, fine; if not, insert a needle with thread from below the eyelid and pass the needle with thread from above, and this should be near the hair itself, and pull the thread upward with the eyelid.
And turn it over with the probe, then make an incision in the inner eyelid below the extra hair with the thin scalpel from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, then remove the thread and place under the eyelid a small pad of cotton or cloth, then mark on the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of a myrtle leaf, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to lift the eyelid, because people vary in this - some need a good amount to be cut from the eyelid according to how much the eyelid has drooped.
And some need less cutting, all according to the drooping of the eyelid. Then cut with the scalpel along the two lines you marked, starting from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, and one cut should be near the natural hair about the thickness of a probe.
Then insert the hook into one of the corners of the skin and peel it all off, then join the two edges with stitching using a needle and fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood and stick the excess threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive substances if.
If you wish to do that, otherwise it doesn't matter. Then leave the stitches and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. If you prefer, you can leave the wound without stitching and treat it with what dries and constricts, for the eyelid will rise when the wound heals and comes together, though stitching is better.
This method of lifting was mentioned by the ancients, though it is burdensome for the patient, yet it is good work without danger. There is another method of lifting where you mark on the eyelid a shape like a myrtle leaf as we described.
Then lift the eyelid with three hooks, either separated or together, in this manner:
Then cut the excess from the eyelid with small scissors in this manner, cutting moderately:
If you cannot hold the hooks steady and they don't work well for you, take a needle with thread and insert it in the middle of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger corner of the eye, and a third thread near the smaller corner, and gather the threads moderately between your fingers, then lift your hand steadily.
Lift all the marked skin as we described, then join the wound edges with stitches and treat until healed. If hot swelling occurs during your cutting or incision, calm that swelling with cerates and similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid can also have its lashes turn inward, so you should use what we mentioned of cutting, stitching, and lifting with fire and sharp medicine. Lifting with fire or sharp medicine is more effective and easier on the patient than cutting and stitching, though cutting and stitching in both cases is more skillful.
Lifting with reed is done in this manner: turn the eyelid and make the incision from inside as I described, then make two thin reeds or wooden pieces as long as the eyelid and narrower than a lancet.
They should be notched at both ends where the threads will hold, then carefully bring them together over the excess eyelid skin and tie the reeds firmly from both sides, leaving them for days until the bound skin dies, blackens, and decays.
Until it falls off by itself, but if it delays, cut it with scissors then treat until it heals. When it heals, the eyelid will lift and the lashes won't prick the eye. This is the form of the two reeds, make them in this shape and exactly this length and width:
Chapter Twelve
On lifting pricking hair from the eye with a needle.
If there are one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a fine needle and thread it with smooth, fine silk thread, then bring its ends together and tie them in a very fine knot, with the thread about a span long.
Then attach another finer, shorter thread to the loop, and tie its ends if you wish. Then have the patient rest their head in your lap near sunlight so the procedure is clear, as it is delicate work. Then insert the needle with the loop at the base of the excess hair.
Pass it through the eyelid quickly until it emerges above the natural hairs, then pull the thread up with the loop and insert into the loop that hair if it's one, or two, or three but no more.
Then pull your hand until the hair comes out with the loop in the eyelid with the natural hair. If you pull the loop and the hair doesn't come with it, pull the loop down with the thread you attached to it until the loop comes out of the upper hole.
Then return the hair into it and pull them - do this until it rises in the upper hole and you can see it clearly. Then remove the loop and thread, and bandage the eye, leaving it bandaged for two or three days until the hair stays in place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either attach to it a long hair from the natural hairs so it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after some time, then lift it.
Chapter Thirteen.
On treating the eversion that occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
This eversion is called "rabbity" and it is either congenital or acquired - the acquired type occurs from the healing of a wound, incision, cauterization, or similar causes.
The method of treatment is to incise that healed area and separate its edges, then place between them a cotton wick and bind it until it heals, and one should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict.
For if you do that, the eversion will return worse than it was - rather, use things that relax like fenugreek and fomentation with water in which marshmallow and flaxseed have been boiled, and diachylon ointment melted with some oils, applied to the wicks and treated with it.
The key to its treatment is to strive by every means to prevent it from healing in the way it was before, and this procedure we mentioned is only a partial correction of the eversion, not returning the site completely to how it was before.
Chapter Fourteen.
On treating the eversion that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This eversion that occurs below is what is truly called ectropion and it can be congenital or acquired - the acquired type occurs from a wound, incision, cauterization, or similar causes.
The method of operation is to take a needle with a doubled thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left canthus to the right canthus until the thread is at the ends of the flesh, then pull the flesh upward with the needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to how it should be, fine; if not, take a probe and place it on the site of the incision and turn the eyelid with it, then make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, with the ends of the incisions from the corners of the cut you made until they meet to form an angle.
Until when joined their shape becomes similar to this shape:
Which is the Greek letter lambda, then remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp side is below what follows the eyelid, then join the separated parts with two sutures using wool thread, then treat it with what we mentioned of relaxing medicines and wicks until it heals.
And if the eversion occurred from an incision or suturing or cauterization, one should make a simple incision below the eyelash hair also as previously mentioned, then separate between the edges with wicks as we described.
The summary of treating eversion whether upper or lower is to conduct the operation according to what presents itself to you from the condition of the eversion, for it can vary greatly in appearance, and the skilled practitioner devises the technique by whatever means possible.
Until he returns the shape to its natural form or close to it, and the disease itself will guide you to what is suitable for it in terms of procedure and instruments in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion occurs to many people where the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing it from easy movement and hindering its natural functions, so one should insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid.
And lift it upward or pull it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a fine scalpel that should not be as sharp as regular scalpels but rather slightly blunt so the patient doesn't become anxious during the procedure causing the scalpel to slip and harm the eye with its sharpness, and your cutting should be as if you're peeling away that adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its natural position and the adhesion heals completely, then pour salt water into the eye to wash it or drop into it verdigris collyrium dissolved in water, then separate between the eyelid and eye with a cotton wick.
And place above the eye wool moistened with egg white, and after the third day use healing collyria until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cutting pterygium and protrusion of flesh in the corners of the eyes.
The pterygium occurs in two types: either it is fibrous, resembling a tough thin membrane, or it is non-fibrous, resembling a white coagulated fluid that, when touched with an instrument or attempted to be grasped with a hook, breaks apart.
And no hook can hold it, and both types begin from the greater corner of the eye until they gradually creep forward until they cover the pupil and prevent light and eye movement, and the method of operation in cutting it is to have the patient place his head in your lap.
Then have him open his eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and pull it upward, then take a needle threaded with a horse or cow hair and a strong thread, bend the needle tip slightly, and pierce it through the middle of the pterygium.
Pass it through with the needle and tie the pterygium with the thread and pull it upward, and separate with the hair the side of the pterygium that is next to the pupil as if you are sawing it with the hair to its end, then cut the remainder at the base of the corner with a fine scalpel or small scissors and leave the natural flesh of the corner.
Lest cutting it cause constant tearing, and you may pull the pterygium with the hook alone or with the thread as we said, then separate it with the smooth-tipped scalpel which is of this form:
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the corneal membrane causing a tear in it leading to protrusion of the pupil, then after cutting apply to the eye some ground salt or verdigris collyrium and leave it until the next day, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the pterygium is non-fibrous and you cannot insert a needle into it nor can a hook hold it, this type of pterygium is often treated with medications and heals as I described in the classification, and if you want to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a fine smooth scalpel with a weak edge of this form:
And gently scrape the pterygium from above, and if you see it becoming loose and crumbling and the scraping is effective, immediately drop into the eye some verdigris collyrium or red collyrium or ground salt and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone, unless inflammation occurs in the eye, in which case leave it and treat the inflammation until it heals, then resume the scraping procedure until it heals, and as for protrusion of flesh in the corner of the eye.
If the protrusion severely harms the eye, hook that protrusion with the hook and cut off some of it, but do not cut too deeply lest it cause constant tearing, then drop red or verdigris collyrium in the corners until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cutting granulation tissue and excess flesh growth in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red flesh grows in layers until it covers or nearly covers the pupil or overflows onto the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids turn outward, and it resembles pomegranate flowers.
The procedure for this is to have the patient place his head in your lap, then have him open his eyes and grasp all that red flesh with hooks suitable for this purpose.
Or hold it with forceps or clamp, then cut the flesh piece by piece until you remove all of it by cutting, and protect the eye lest you harm it during the procedure, and your cutting should be done either with the scalpel we described for cutting pterygium or with small scissors.
Like those used to remove pannus, as will be shown in the chapter following this chapter.
When you complete your cutting and all the granulation tissue is gone, fill the eye with ground salt or drop in red powder and similar caustic medications, and place cotton with egg white on the eye externally to prevent inflammation.
If any granulation tissue remains and you are overwhelmed by bleeding and fear inflammation, leave the eye and treat it with what calms inflammation, then return to the procedure until it heals, and do likewise with excess flesh that occurs in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any eye that is weak by nature or by accident with surgical instruments, and do not undertake any of these procedures until you see that the organ can withstand that procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
On Extracting the Veins from the Eye.
The veins are red vessels that spread over the eye, preventing vision and weakening the eye over time. You must first examine [the eye], and if the eye with the veins is strong and has no other disease except the veins,
then extract them. This is done by instructing the patient to place their head in your lap, then hook those vessels with one or two hooks, depending on your skill, and the hooks should be fine and curved in this manner:.
or [you can use] two double-headed hooks in one handle, in this form:.
Then, gently cut those vessels with fine scissors, and wipe the blood occasionally until you see that those vessels have disappeared from the eye and the blood has flowed out. Be careful not to harm the eye with the tips of the scissors, and do your work in the presence of the sun for half the day.
And be very diligent in your work, lest you cut anything other than those veins. When you are done, drop the green or red collyrium into the eye, so that its pungency may consume what remains of the veins. If you cannot extract all of it in that session, then bandage the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye.
Leave it for days until the pain subsides and the hot swelling is secure, then repeat the procedure in the same manner until this condition is cured. This is the form of the scissors.
And [the technique is that] the patient's head should be in the student's lap, and another [assistant] dries the tears and examines the front and back of the eye, and you [the surgeon] are in charge of the work. The principle in the work is to open the eye with fixed or triangular speculums held by a skilled assistant.
The patient's head should be in the assistant's lap, and another [assistant] dries the tears and examines the front and back of the eye, and you have the choice to start the extraction from the top of the eye or the bottom, and it is preferable to fix two hooks on the upper side, one at the end of the eyebrow and the other at its beginning.
And hold them between the middle and index fingers, then attach the hooks from underneath in front of them, then hold them between the little and ring fingers. Gently raise your hand until you see all the veins have risen, then cut the smallest vein if you wish with scissors, or if you wish, with a fine lancet.
And insert the probe onto a needle and thoroughly examine the entire vein until it rises on the conjunctiva, and do not cut the drying [application], for the tears and blood will flow over you.
Then cut with the scissors what is in excess above and below the eyebrow, so that nothing remains stuck except in the cornea. If you can lift it off the cornea, remove it with the probe - this is better. And it may be possible in some people.
And if you cut it, the excised area will be inflamed for days, its pain will subside, and the hot swelling will be secured, then repeat the work on it.
Chapter Nineteen. 
On Returning the Fistula to the Nose.
The doctors call the fistula a sinus. If you have treated it with cautery or the pungent, burning medication as described before, and it has not healed, the only remedy is to incise the swelling when it matures, and extract all the moisture or pus in it,
until the bone is exposed. If you see decay or blackness in the bone, remove it with this instrument: .
And it is called the "rough-headed" [instrument]. It is made of Indian steel, its head rounded like a button, engraved with fine grooves like a rasp or a file. Place it on the site of the bone decay, then turn it between your fingers, gripping your hand slightly, until you know that the decay has been removed.
Do this several times, then bandage the site with drying, astringent medications. If the site closes and the flesh grows, and the flow of pus stops, and it remains so for forty days without recurrence or inflammation or incident,
then know that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no remedy except to return the sinus to the nasal aperture, in this manner: Expose the bone again, either with the iron or the pungent medication. When the bone is exposed, take a perforator like this: .
Its tip is triangular, and its shaft is conical, tapered towards the tip as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, near the inner corner of the eye, a little distant from the eye, then turn your hand with the perforator until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels the air coming out of it when they hold their hand over their nose.
At that point, bandage the site with the drying, astringent medications as I have taught you. When the flesh has grown and the site has hardened, the matter that was flowing outward will return to the nose, and that will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On the Reduction of the Eye.
If the entire eye is protruded and there is no injury or diminution in vision, the patient should be laxed, then bled in the cephalic vein, then a cupping glass should be applied to the occiput without scarification, and gently suctioned.
Then a topical application should be placed on the eye, made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and verdigris. Then the eye should be bandaged with many folds, and the description of the folds is that you take soft, numerous rags and fold each one into four layers to make many.
Then place them one on top of the other according to the need of the eye, then bind them tightly with a firm cloth and reapply the cupping glass by suction without scarification, then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage becomes loose during that time, it should be tightened well. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night as we said. If you see the eye has returned, otherwise repeat the dressing, folds, binding, and cupping glass until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One. 
On the Excision of the Iris.
If a hernia appears in the iris layer, then it protrudes outside the eyelids like the appearance of grapes, and the appearance of the person is disfigured because of that, and you want to cut it, the work on it is as I describe.
And it is that you insert a needle into the base of the iris from below to above, then you insert another needle with a folded thread from the side of the lacrimal point and pass it through, and leave the first needle as it is.
Then cut the place of the bend of the folded thread and tie part of the iris around the needle and tighten it well, then remove the needle and place wet cotton soaked in egg white on the eye and leave it until the threads fall off with the iris, then treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals, and you may bind the iris from all sides with a circle of cloth until the eye becomes more protruded, then prick it gently with a thin lancet until it reaches the depth of the eye, so the vitreous humor drains and the eye descends and atrophies in place, then bind it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the Treatment of the Hypopyon.
This disease which is called the hypopyon is only a collection of pus in the eye resembling flowing water but it is not, and the way of working on that is that you seat the patient upright on a chair, then take his head with your hands from the two sides.
And move it until you see the pus move to the bottom in your eye, then hold it and do not move, and the light is released and the patient sees things as he used to see them, and if the pus does not descend to the bottom as we mentioned, we know that it is water, and if the descent of the pus is not achieved by what we have mentioned.
Otherwise, seat the patient before you, then take a thin lancet and incise slightly above the corneal membrane at the junction of the conjunctiva and the corneal membrane in the limbus, until the material comes out.
And when it comes out, instill hot water in which honey or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled, then treat with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On the Couching of the Descending Water in the Eye.
We have mentioned the types of water in the classification and which of them is suitable for couching with detailed and explained speech, take it from there correctly. Then it is necessary to seat the patient before you in a cross-legged position facing the light near the sun.
And bind his healthy eye and tighten it well, then raise his eyelid with your left hand if the eye with the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the tip of the couching needle near the limbus at the thickness of a probe in the white of the eye from the side of the smaller lacrimal point, then push the couching needle forcefully as you rotate it in your hand until it penetrates into the white of the eye and you feel the couching needle has reached something empty.
And it is necessary that the depth to which the couching needle goes be the distance that is from the child to the end of the black, which is the limbus of the eye, for you see the copper in the same observer as the eye, due to the clarity of the corneal membrane, then direct the couching needle upwards to the place where the water is. 
Then press it downwards repeatedly, if the water descends immediately, the patient will see what is opened for him from the moment the couching needle is in his eye, then calm down a little, if the water rises, lower it again without removing the couching needle.
If it is settled and does not rise, then remove the probe gently while twisting your hand little by little. Then dissolve something of pure Andrani salt in water and wash the eye from the inside. Then place on the outside of the eye all a bandage or wet cotton.
With rose oil and egg white, and the healthy eye is bandaged. But we and the people of our time, we put on it the pounded cumin with egg white. If the probe does not enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have a very hard eye.
Then you should take the lancet called the fleam, which has this shape:
You only perforate the conjunctiva itself, and do not go deep into the perforation, but rather you lightly tap the probe in the place, then you introduce the probe as we have mentioned. When your work is complete, you prepare for the patient a secure reclining place in which he will sleep on his back in a dark room.
And he is prohibited from all movements and from coughing, and you make his food what softens his nature, and he must not move his head to the right or left at all. And the bandage remains in its state until the third day, then you uncover it in that dark room and test his sight.
And you show him things, then you put the bandage back until the seventh day. And it is not appropriate to do that during the treatment or after the perforation at the time, but it is necessary to avoid that before, because the water rises quickly with severe vision.
If a hot swelling occurs, it is necessary to uncover the eye before the seventh [day] and treat that with what calms the swelling until when it subsides, then you release his sight and place over it a veil that trains his sight from under it for some days, and he is in that dark room, then.
He goes out of the room gradually and engages in his affairs. And know that the perforation, the learner cannot do without observing it many times, then he proceeds with the work. And I have heard from some of the Iraqis that he mentioned that he makes in Iraq a perforated probe that sucks in the water.
And I have not seen anyone in our country make that, nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients, and that may be something new. And this is the shape of some types of probes so that those who are ignorant of it may know:
They are made especially of copper, and its end is exactly as thin as this, triangular in shape, sharp.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of the flesh that grows in the nose.
Various fleshy growths may grow in the nose, some of them resembling the many-legged scorpion, and some of them being hard cancerous flesh of dark color, and some of them being soft flesh not of dark color.
As for those fleshy growths that are soft and are neither malignant nor cancerous, it is necessary that you seat the patient before you facing the sun, and open his nostril, and throw the hook into those fleshy growths, then pull them out. Then cut what you have reached with a delicate sharp lancet from one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone, if something remains that you cannot cut, then strip it gently with one of the delicate tools, so that nothing remains of it. If the blood overcomes you or a hot swelling occurs.
Then deal with it as is appropriate, or if it was of the malignant swellings, then hurry and cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the fleshy growths are gone, then throw into the nose after the cutting vinegar and water or a drink. If the nose opens and the moisture flows into the throat.
Then know that it has healed. But if the moisture does not flow as it should, then know that there is growing flesh in the upper porous bones that the tool did not reach with the cutting. Then it is necessary that you take a thread of flax with some thickness.
And you tie many knots in it, and you make between each knot about a finger's width or less. And the patient skillfully inserts one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or with what he can, after he has made it like a button. And he pulls its breath until it reaches the palate.
And it comes out on his throat. And often the children do this in the schools, and it is an easy thing for whoever wants to do it. Then you gather the two ends of the thread, the one that came out on the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then you use to saw the flesh with the knots that are in the thread. You do that until you know that the fleshy growths have been cut by the knots of the thread, then you take out the thread and place in the nose after wiping the blood a wick that has absorbed the Egyptian ointment. You do that for three days or more.
Until the ointment eats up all that remains of the fleshy growths, then the last thing in the nose is a lead tube for some days until it heals. If it needs drying treatment, that was used.
This is the image of the dropper with which you drip oils and medicines into the nose:
It is placed of silver or copper, similar to a small lamp, open in its oiling and its passage is likewise.
And if you wish, you made the tube closed like a pipe and the oiler of the dropper is flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, you hold it when you heat the oil or what you wish of the juices or the flowing substances.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
On the warts growing at the tip of the nose.
It often grows a wart at the tip of the nose, it becomes large and increases with the days until its appearance becomes ugly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it at the first appearance and completely remove it, then carry on the site either cauterization or the caustic medicine that takes the place of cauterization. If its cutting is missed until it becomes large, then look, if it is hardened, solid, of dull color, and of little sensation.
Do not expose it to the iron, for it is a cancerous tumor, and I have often seen the cutting of this tumor returning a great evil to its owner. And if the tumor is soft to the touch, not of dull color, and you see that cutting is possible in all of it.
Then evacuate the patient and cut it without caution or fear, and treat the site with what dries and astringes until it heals.
The twenty-sixth chapter.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear.
If their connection is disrupted by a wound or the like, know that whenever a disruption of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, little benefits in it the work, except in some people.
So it is necessary, whenever something of that happens to someone, to look, if the wound is fresh with its blood, that you gather the edges of the wound with suturing, then treat it until it heals. And if the disruption of the connection has separated its edges and each side has become sound, it is necessary to peel off each side the apparent thickness of its skin until it bleeds.
Then gather the edges with suturing, tighten them, and sprinkle on them powdered alum and frankincense, and place on top of the powder a plaster of palm ointment or other astringent ointments, and leave it tightened for two or three days, then undo it.
And change the medicine and leave it until the threads fall off by themselves, then treat it with the ointment until it heals. The formula of suturing is to gather the disruption of the connection either with needles as we described in the suturing of the abdomen, or with thread as I have informed you there.
The twenty-seventh chapter. 
On extracting the knots that occur in the lips.
Many people may have in the inside of their lips small, hardened tumors, some of which resemble chickpea grains, and some are smaller and larger. It is necessary to turn the lip over and incise on each knot and hang it with a hook.
And cut it from all sides, then fill the site after the cutting with powdered vitriol until the blood is stopped, then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the sites with what contains astringency until the wounds heal.
The twenty-eighth chapter.
On cutting the excess flesh in the gums.
It often grows on the gum an excess of flesh, which the ancients call 'ab-ulus'. It is necessary to hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its origin, and leave the pus to flow or the blood, then place powdered vitriol on the site.
Or one of the astringent and desiccant powders. If that flesh returns after the treatment, it often returns, so cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after the cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On Scaling the Teeth with Iron.
Coarse, ugly scales may accumulate on the tooth surfaces, both inside and outside, and between the gums. They may become blackened, yellowish, or greenish, until the resulting decay reaches the gum and deforms the teeth.
It is necessary that you seat the patient before you, with his head in your lap, and scale the molar or tooth in which you see the scales and the sand-like substance, until nothing remains of it. Likewise, you should do this with the blackness, greenness, and yellowness, until you have thoroughly cleansed it.
If what is in it goes away with the first scaling, well and good. Otherwise, repeat the scaling on another day, and a second and a third time, until you reach the goal you desire. And know that the molar requires different shaped scalers, in many forms, according to what is suitable for your work.
For the scaler that scales the molar from the inside is not the same as the one that scales it from the outside, and the one that scales between the molars is in another form. And you should have all these different forms of scalers prepared.
Chapter Thirty. 
On Extracting Teeth.
It is necessary that you treat the painful molar by every means, and do not hasten to extract it, for there is no substitute for it if extracted, since it is a noble substance. But if there is no alternative to extracting it,
Then when the patient decides to extract it, you must be firm until the painful tooth is firmly established for you.
For often the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks it is in the healthy tooth, so he extracts it, then the pain does not go away until he extracts the diseased tooth. We have seen this happen many times from the actions of cupping practitioners.
So if the painful tooth is firmly established for you, then you should incise around the tooth with a lancet that has some strength, until you loosen the gum from all sides. Then move it a little with your fingers or with delicate forceps, until you shake it.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps, with the patient's head between your knees, which you have steadied so that it does not move. Then pull the tooth straight, lest you break it. If it does not come out, then take one of those tools and insert it under it gently from all sides, and move it as you did at first.
And if the tooth is perforated or eroded, it is necessary to fill that hole with a rag and seal it well with the tip of a thin rod, lest it crumbles when you tighten the forceps on it. And you must thoroughly incise around the gum from all sides.
And be very careful not to break it, for if part of it remains, it will return to the patient with a calamity greater than his original pain. And beware of doing what ignorant cupping practitioners do in their boldness and hastiness to extract it without using what we have described.
For they often inflict great calamities on people, the least of which is that the tooth is broken and all or part of its roots remain.
Or that it is extracted with part of the jawbone, as we have seen many times. Then he rinses with a drink or vinegar and salt after its extraction. If bleeding occurs from the site, which often happens, then immediately grind something from vitriol and pack the site with it.
Otherwise, cauterize it if the vitriol does not benefit you. The form of the delicate forceps with which you first move the tooth should be long in the tips, short in the handle, and thick, so that they do not bend when you grasp the tooth with them.
And this is the form of the large forceps: they should be as you see, thick in the handles so that when you grasp them, they do not give way nor bend. Short in the tips, and made of Indian steel or well-tempered steel, with serrated tips that interlock, so that they grasp firmly and tightly.
And you can make the tips in the form of a rasp, and they will also be strongly gripping.
Chapter Thirty-One. 
On Extracting Tooth Roots and Removing Broken Jawbone Parts.
If, after extracting the tooth, a root remains that has broken, it is necessary to place a cotton pad with ghee on the site for a day or two until the site relaxes, then insert into it the forceps or the ones whose tips resemble the beak of the bird called the pelican. And this is the form of those forceps.
Which resemble their extremities the beak of the bird called the pelican, and this is the image of the forceps:
You may have made it like a rasp from the inside or like the scalpel, but if it does not bring you out with these forceps, you must dig on the root and expose all the flesh with the scalpel, then enter the tool that resembles a small lever, which is this image:
Short-tipped, slightly thick, and not curved so as not to break. If the root comes out with that, otherwise use these other tools, which are this image, the first triangular-tipped with some thickness:
Image of another delicate triangular:
And we may also use this tool with two branches, which is also this image:
And other tools and irons that were mentioned earlier in the inventory of the teeth, and we may also use this tool that resembles the large hook, which is this image:
Triangular-tipped, curved, with a little thickness so as not to break, and not curved, and know that the tools of the teeth are many, and likewise all the tools are almost innumerable, and the skilled craftsman in his craft may invent tools for himself according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate.
For some of the diseases have not been mentioned tools for them by the ancients due to the difference in their types, so if a bone from the jaw or from one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decays, examine it in its place with what suits it from one of these tools and forceps mentioned in extracting the roots.
And we use this image of a forceps:
It has a little thickness to hold the bone so that it does not slip out until the bone comes out, and we splint the place with the appropriate medicines, and if the bone has a slight decay, then strip it of its decay and blackness until it purifies, then treat it until it heals.
The thirty-second chapter.
On the extraction of teeth erupted on others.
The teeth, if they erupt on other than their natural course, the form becomes ugly, especially if this happens in women and the delicate, so you should look, if the tooth has erupted from behind another tooth.
And it is not possible to spread it or return it, extract it, and if it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this tool, which is this image:
And it resembles the small beak, and let it be of Indian steel, very sharp-tipped, and your cutting of it should be on many days due to the hardness of the tooth and so as not to shake the others of the teeth, and as for if it is prominent and firmly established, then file it with a file from India, which is this image.
It is all of Indian [steel] and its hilt of it is very finely engraved, like the rasp with which the needles are made, file the tooth slowly, slowly, on many days gently, lest the tooth shake and fall, then smooth it finally and strip it with some scrapers.
And if a tooth has broken off some of it, and it hurts the tongue when speaking, it is necessary to file it as well, until the roughness of that break disappears and it becomes even and smooth, and does not hurt the tongue nor spoil the speech.
Chapter Thirty-Third.
On ligating the loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the anterior teeth become loose and mobile due to a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything to eat, so that they do not fall out, and the astringent medicines did not benefit them in the treatment.
The trick in this is to tie them with a gold or silver thread, and gold is better, because silver tarnishes and corrupts after some days, while gold remains in its state forever and does not suffer that, and the thread should be of medium fineness and thickness according to the space between the teeth.
And the form of the ligature is that you take the thread and enter its bend between the sound teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, one or more, until you reach the sound tooth on the other side.
Then you return the weaving to the side from which you started, and tighten your hand gently and wisely so that it does not move at all, and your tightening of the thread should be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not slip out, then you cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors and gather them and twist them with lint and hide them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
So that the tongue is not hurt, then leave it tied like this for as long as it remains, and if it loosens or breaks, tie it with another thread, and he will benefit from it forever like this, and this is the form of the teeth and the manner of the ligature in two sound teeth and two loose teeth as you see:.
And you may return the one or two teeth after they have fallen in their place and ligate them as we described, and they will remain, and only a skilled craftsman does that, and he may carve a bone from the bones of the ox and make it in the form of a tooth and place it in the place from which the tooth has gone.
And he ties it as we said, and it remains and he benefits from that,. 
Chapter Thirty-Fourth.
On cutting the ligament that appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament that appears under the tongue may be either natural, which the person is born with, or it may be accidental from a wound that has healed.
The work in it is that you open the patient's mouth and his head is in your lap, and you raise his tongue, then you cut that nervous ligament transversely until the tongue is released from its restraint, and if there is some hardness and complexity in it and that is from the healing of a wound, then you split it with a probe and cut it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knot is loosened.
And beware that the incision is not too deep into the flesh, for you may cut an artery there and bleeding will occur, then he rinses with rose water or vinegar and cold water, then place a cotton wick under the tongue which the patient holds every night.
So that it does not heal again, and if bleeding occurs, place powdered vitriol on the place, and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize the place with a lentil-shaped cautery that is suitable for that.
Then treat it with the rest of the appropriate treatment until it heals,. 
Chapter Thirty-Fifth.
On removing the frog that forms under the tongue.
There may occur under the tongue a swelling resembling a small frog that prevents the tongue from performing its natural function, and it may grow until it fills the mouth, and the work in it is that you open the patient's mouth towards the sun and look at the swelling.
If you see it dark in color or black and hard, the patient does not feel it, so do not touch it, for it is a cancer, and if it is inclined to whiteness and has moisture in it, split it with a probe and cut it with a fine scalpel and remove it from all sides.
If the blood overwhelms you during your work, place powdered vitriol on it until the bleeding stops, then return to your work until you extract it completely, then he rinses with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with the rest of the appropriate treatment until it heals,.
The thirty-sixth chapter.
On the treatment of tonsil swelling.
And what grows in the throat of other swellings may occur inside the throat, glands resembling the glands that occur from the outside, called tonsils. If you treat them with what I mentioned in the division, and they do not heal.
So look, if the swelling is hard, of a pale color, and has little sensation, do not expose it to the iron. And if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not expose it to the iron either, for fear of bleeding blood, but leave it until it ripens, either you incise it or it bursts of itself.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, this is what should be cut, and the work in it is that you look before the operation if its hot swelling has settled completely or decreased somewhat.
Then sit the patient next to the sun, with his head in your lap, and open his mouth, and take a servant in front of you who presses his tongue down with this tool:.
Made of silver or copper, it is thin like a knife. If you press the tongue with it and the swelling becomes visible to your eye, take a hook and insert it into the tonsil and pull it out as much as possible without pulling anything of the membranes with it.
Then cut it with a tool that looks like scissors, except that its two ends are bent so that the mouth of each one is opposite the other, very sharp, made of Indian iron or Damascus steel:.
If this tool is not available, then cut it with a lancet that looks like this:.
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same way, then after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If he has a hemorrhage, gargle with water that has boiled pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves or the like of astringents until the bleeding is stopped, then treat him until he is cured. And other swellings may grow in the throat other than the tonsils, you cut them as I mentioned in cutting the tonsils, alike.
And I treated a woman from a swelling that had grown inside her throat, tending towards paleness, with little sensation, almost blocking the throat, and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had prevented her from eating and drinking water.
And she was on the verge of death if she had remained for a day or two, and the swelling had two branches protruding from it until they came out of her nostrils. I quickly inserted a hook into one of them and pulled it, and a good piece was pulled out.
Then I cut it where I reached it from the nostril opening, then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril opening, then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue, then I inserted the hook into the swelling itself and cut part of it, and only a small amount of blood flowed.
The woman's throat was opened, and she hurried at that moment to drink water, then she took food. We continued to cut from that swelling repeatedly for a long time, and the swelling would recur in place of what was cut, until that prolonged for me and for her.
So I resorted to cauterizing the swelling inside the throat, so it stopped increasing, then I traveled from that place and did not know what God did with her after me.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On the excision of the uvular tumor.
If a descent of the fluxion occurs to the uvula and it becomes swollen and is white and elongated, it is called a "column"; and if it is thick at the bottom and rounded, it is called a "grape". If it is treated with what we mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not benefit,
and I see that the hot tumor has subsided from it and it has become thin, it is necessary to cut it. And what of it is collected, rounded, and does not have a length, and is bloody or of a dark color or has no sensation, it is necessary to avoid cutting it.
For in it there is a risk to the patient, so if you see it in the manner mentioned, of its whiteness and length, it is necessary for the patient to sit facing the sun, and you press his tongue with the instrument described earlier, then you insert the hook into the grape.
And you pull it down and cut it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the section on tonsillectomy. And it is necessary not to cut from it except what has exceeded the natural order without excess, for if you cut more from it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the cutting, use what we described in the tonsillectomy section to treat it until it heals. If the patient is afraid of cutting it, it is necessary to use the method of cauterizing it without fear or caution, and the direction of the cauterization in it is by the sharp medicine, which is that you place the patient's head in your lap.
Then you press his tongue with the instrument mentioned, then you take from the sharp water mentioned in the cauterization chapter and knead with it unslaked lime, and you make it neither thick nor thin, and you fill the recess of this instrument with it, and this is its shape:
Its end in which you place the medicine has a recess like the recess of a spatula. And you place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, and the patient is lying on his side so that the saliva flows from his mouth from inside his throat, lest something descends from it to his throat and harms him.
Then you hold your hand with the medicine and press it on the uvula for about half an hour until you see it has turned black and the burning of the medicine has subsided. And if you wish, you can take a cotton swab and wrap it around the end of a spatula, and wet the cotton in the medicine.
And you insert the spatula with the cotton into a tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula. You do this repeatedly until you reach what you want from the cauterization of the grape, then you leave it, for it will wither and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, you reapply it.
After the cauterization, wipe around the grape with a cotton swab soaked in ghee and dry with it what is around it from the medicine, then he rinses with cold water and is treated externally with fomentations and internally with gargles until he heals. This type of treatment is safer than excision and further from fear.
And the uvula can also be treated with what is gentler than cauterization and excision, treated by fumigation in this manner: Take fenugreek, hyssop, thyme, rue, wormwood, chamomile, and the like of the herbs, gather them all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
And boil them, and the pot is sealed with wax, and there is a hole in the middle of the lid to which the hollow instrument is attached in this way: It is made of silver or copper.
Enter the part in which the pomegranate is into the mouth of the patient until the vapor ascends to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula becomes warm, then repeat it several times until it withers, and beware of doing this treatment at the beginning of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling, and it is necessary to do that when the heat of the swelling has subsided. If you do not have this tool, take a reed and attach an eggshell to its end so that the mouth of the patient is not burned.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the vapor from burning the mouth, and this is one of the good treatments with its safety.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On the extraction of thorns and what gets stuck in the throat other than that.
It often happens that a bone or a fish thorn or something else gets stuck in the throat, so it is necessary to extract what is visible to the eye after pressing the tongue with the tool in the sun.
To make clear to you what is in the throat, and what is not visible to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary for the patient to vomit before his food is digested in his stomach, perhaps the stuck thing will come out with the vomiting or the patient will swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root.
Or he swallows a piece of dry bread, or you take a piece of soft sea sponge and tie it with a thread, then he swallows it. When it reaches the location of the thorn, quickly pull the thread, do this several times.
For often the thorn or bone sticks in it and comes out, and if it does not come out with what we have mentioned, otherwise use a leaden tool in this form:
It will be a little thicker than the probe, and at its end there is a hook, the patient inserts it into his throat gently while raising his head upwards, and he is careful not to touch his larynx lest he causes a cough, and he pushes the bone or thorn, or the doctor inserts it with his hand.
The patient's insertion of it is better, for he knows the location of the stuck thing and pushes it downwards or pulls it upwards with the tool, all of that as much as is prepared for him until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On the extraction of the leech stuck in the throat.
If you treat the leech with what we have mentioned in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not work, then look in the patient's throat in the sun after pressing his tongue with the tool I described to you.
If your eye falls on the leech, pull it with a small hook or a tightly closed tweezers, and if you cannot with them, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then insert into the cavity of the tube an iron heated by fire.
Do that several times, and the patient will endure without water all day, then he takes a basin full of cold water and opens his mouth in it and rinses with it and does not swallow a drop of it and moves the water from time to time with his hand.
For the leech falls on the spot when it senses the water, and if it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the throat with urine and with asafoetida with the tool described for the fumigation of the uvula, do that several times, for it will fall.
The way of working in the fumigation is that you take an amount in which there is glowing embers heated by fire, and the container is covered with a lid in the middle of which there is a hole, then you install the end of the tool in that hole, then you throw the incense, and the patient places his mouth in the end of the tube and closes his mouth so that the incense does not come out until he knows that the incense has reached his throat.
For the leech falls on the spot, and if it does not fall, then the incense is repeated several times, and the patient endures the thirst and eats the salty and garlic, and does not drink water, and it must come out with this treatment, and this is the shape of the tool with which the leech is extracted from the throat if it is seen.
And it resembles the claws as you see, except that it has this hook that enters the throat, and its ends resemble the beak of a bird, in which there is the roughness of the file if you grasp something, you will not let go of it.
And another tool with which the tongue is pressed, and it is a wide iron ring that can accommodate the mouth above the tongue, it is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, so the mouth remains open without the patient's will, and he cannot remove it at all until you remove it.
Description of the instrument used to open the mouth according to this specific measurement.
Chapter Forty.
On the discussion of lancing and incising swellings.
There are many diverse types of swellings, as will be mentioned one by one in this book, and they differ in their lancing and incision in two ways: first in the type of swelling itself and the fluids it contains.
The second type differs according to the locations where they occur in the body, for a swelling occurring in the head is unlike a swelling occurring in the anus, and a swelling occurring in a fleshy area is unlike a swelling occurring in a joint - each one has its own procedural rule.
Among swellings are those that should not be lanced except after the pus has matured and completed, and among them are those that should be lanced while raw and not fully matured, like swellings that are close to joints.
For when a swelling occurs near a joint and its condition persists until what surrounds it becomes infected, it may corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing permanent disability of that limb, or the swelling may be near a vital organ.
For if you delay its lancing until it matures, you harm that vital organ, or it may be near the anus, so you lance it while raw. The reason for lancing an immature swelling near the anus is to prevent the depth from becoming infected and penetrating into the anus, turning into a fistula.
And becoming incurable. You should know the time to lance fully matured swellings, which is when the swelling's pain subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and throbbing decrease, the top of the swelling becomes wrinkled, and other signs appear.
The incision should be made at the lowest point of the swelling if possible, to make it easier for the pus to flow downward, or at the thinnest and most protruding part of the swelling. The incision should follow the length of the body if the swellings are in areas like the hands and feet.
And in areas of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and generally in all straight areas that do not bend. As for areas that bend, the incision should follow the nature of that area. And if the swelling is in fleshy areas, it is better to leave its lancing.
Until its maturation is complete as we said, for if you lance it before that, the discharge of pus will be prolonged and there will be much dirt and filth, and perhaps its lips and depth will harden. Some swellings must be lanced across the body when necessary or according to what the organ requires.
Small swellings should receive a single incision, and large swellings should receive a wide incision or multiple cuts according to the size of the swelling. There are some swellings where the skin should be hollowed out and cut if it has become like a rag.
And has reached the point of death, as happens in many abscesses and hidden swellings. Some require a triangular incision, and some require cutting in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like groin swellings.
Some require circular incisions and crescent-shaped incisions and similar cuts. Those without a head, like smooth flat swellings, should only receive a simple incision. If the swelling is large and has collected much pus and you lance it, you should not rush to remove all the pus at that time.
Rather, remove some of it, then bind the swelling until another day, then remove some pus again, doing this repeatedly and gradually until all of it is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or a very elderly person, for the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden exit of pus, and the patient might die without you realizing, so be extremely cautious of this matter.
After lancing these swellings, you should wipe the wound and examine it. If the wound of the swelling is small or if there is a single simple incision, use wicks made of linen or old cotton, and if the swelling is large and there are many incision cuts.
You should insert a wick into each incision until they connect with each other, and if part of the tumor has been cut from the skin or hollowed out, you should stuff it with worn cotton or linen fibers without moisture and bind it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your operation, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a linen cloth in them and apply it to the bleeding site repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the procedures, treatments, and powders that we have described in many places in this book and in the classification. If it is winter and the tumor site has many nerves, you should moisten the dressings with wine and hot oil.
And place them on the site, and if it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply dressings soaked in water and oil or wine and oil, all of this cold, until the third day as we said, then you should untie the tumor and wipe it.
And use in its treatment what suits it until it heals. This is what you need to know about tumor treatment in general, and as for the detailed approach, I have mentioned how to treat each tumor, organized and summarized.
Chapter Forty-One.
On Incising Tumors That Occur in the Scalp.
Small tumors occur in the scalp, and they are types of cysts contained in membranes that are like chicken gizzards, and there are many types: some are fatty, and some contain moisture resembling mud.
And some contain moisture resembling crushed wheat and soup and such, and some are hardened and solid, and there is no danger in incising and removing any of them unless you encounter an artery during the incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument whose image follows this, which is called the probe, until you know what they contain. If what they contain is fluid, make a simple longitudinal incision in this manner:
Begin the incision from line B to line C, and when the fluid is emptied, peel away the sac that contained that fluid and cut all of it, leaving absolutely nothing of it, for it often returns if any of it remains.
Then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment if available, or else in salt water, and fill the wound with it and leave it until the next day, for it will consume what remains of the sac. Then reapply the cotton with Egyptian ointment a second and third time if you need to do so.
Until you are certain that nothing remains of the sac, then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. And if the tumor contains a fatty cyst, make an incision in this manner:
A cruciform incision, and place hooks in the lips of the wound and peel it from all sides, and strive your utmost to remove the membrane that contains it. If you encounter an artery, do as I described to you later, and likewise do the same with the tumor if it is hardened, regarding the incision.
And the treatment is exactly as I mentioned. And incising the hardened tumor is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these tumors in the head in some people have no moisture at all, for I once made an incision on a tumor in...
The head of an elderly woman and found the tumor like a hard stone, rough and white, that could not be broken, and if someone were to throw it, it would cause a head wound. And as for the rest of the tumors occurring in the head unlike these, such as tumors that occur in children's heads...
And near the bases of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision and make their opening from the bottom to facilitate the flow of matter downward, then treat them with appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On Incising Scrofulous Tumors That Occur in the Neck. These tumors frequently occur in the neck and under the armpits and in the groins, and they may occur in the rest of the body. What occurs in the neck may be single or multiple, and some generate from others.
Each of these scrofulous tumors is contained within its own special membrane, as occurs in sebaceous cysts and head tumors as we described. There are many types of these scrofulous tumors - some are hardened, some contain fluids, and some are malignant that don't respond to treatment.
When you find one that feels good to the touch, with its surface close to skin color, moving in all directions, and not attached to the neck nerves, jugular vein, or artery, and not deep-seated,
You should make a simple incision from top to bottom of the body in this shape from line C to line B:
Separate it from all sides and stretch the skin edges with one hook, two hooks, or multiple hooks if needed, as we mentioned for head tumors, and remove it gradually while being careful not to cut any vessel or nerve, and the scalpel should not be too sharp.
Lest your hand slip while cutting or the patient becomes agitated and you cut what need not be cut. If you cut a vessel or artery that hinders your work, place ground vitriol or some of the powder medications that stop bleeding in the wound.
Bind the wound and leave it until the tumor's acute phase subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to suppurate, for the bleeding will stop then. Return to your work until finished, then probe with your index finger if any other small tumors remain, cut them out and clean the area.
If there is a large vessel at the base of the tumor, you should not cut the tumor from its base, but rather tie it with a strong doubled thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm. Then pack the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
If you remove the entire tumor, you should bring together the wound edges and suture it immediately after ensuring no remnant remains at all. If you see that remnants remain due to the tumor's size,
You should aim to cut at its base and root, and employ suturing as we mentioned. For tumors containing fluids, make a simple incision where you see its ripeness appears, and make the incision toward the bottom as we said.
Then after the incision, use wicks with Egyptian ointment and similar medications to consume what corruption remains until when you see the wound has cleaned, treat it with flesh-growing ointments until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Three
On Incising the Larynx for Swelling that Occurs Inside the Throat
The ancients mentioned this laryngeal incision and I haven't seen anyone in our country perform it. This is the sequence of their words: As for those with quinsy, they should avoid laryngeal incision as they won't benefit from it.
Because all the vessels and lungs are diseased. But for those who have hot swelling in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, when there is no disease in the trachea, laryngeal incision must be used to escape the damage that comes from suffocation.
When we want to do this, we should make a small transverse incision in the larynx below three or four tracheal rings between two rings, just enough that the incision is in the membrane not the cartilage, and this location is suitable for incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and blood vessels are far from it. If the practitioner is timid, he should stretch the throat skin with a hook then incise the skin until reaching the trachea, avoiding blood vessels if he sees any.
Then incise the membrane we described. The incision of the trachea is indicated by the phlegm that comes out with what is pierced and by loss of voice. Leave the wound open for a time, and when the time of feared suffocation has passed, bring together the skin wound edges.
Suture it alone without the cartilage, then use medications that grow flesh until it heals. The author of this book said: The interpretation of all this speech we related is for when they see the patient whose throat is blocked by one of these swellings they mentioned.
When the patient approached death and was about to expire, they proceeded to cut the larynx so the patient could breathe somewhat through the wound site and be saved from death. They ordered that the wound be left open until the severity of the illness passed, and its severity [typically] lasts three days or thereabouts.
At that point, they ordered the wound to be sutured and treated until it healed. What I witnessed myself was that a servant took a knife and directed it at her throat, cutting part of the bronchus. I was called to treat her and found her making sounds like a slaughtered animal, so I examined the wound.
I found that the blood which had emerged from the wound was minimal, so I was certain she hadn't cut an artery or jugular vein, and air was coming out of the wound. I promptly sutured the wound and treated it until it healed. Nothing affected the servant except some hoarseness in her voice, nothing more.
She returned after several days to her best condition, and from this we say that cutting the larynx carries no danger.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On Incising the Swelling That Appears on the External Throat, Called the Elephant of the Throat.
This swelling called the elephant of the throat becomes a large swelling the color of the body, and it is common in women, and it is of two types.
Either it is natural or it is incidental. As for the natural type, there is no treatment for it, and as for the incidental, it comes in two forms: one resembles fatty cysts, and the other form resembles swelling that comes from arterial knotting, and cutting it is dangerous.
One should not approach it with iron [surgical tools] at all, except for those that are small, if you probe it and examine it with the probe and find it resembles a fatty cyst and is not attached to any of the vessels, then cut it as you would cut into cysts.
Extract it with whatever surrounds it of the sac if it is in a sac, and if not, then remove all of it thoroughly, then treat the area with whatever treatment is appropriate.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On Incising the Types of Cysts.
Cysts have many types, and I have mentioned all their types in the Classification, and we should explain here the difference between a cyst and an abscess as it is confusing. I say that an abscess comes with heat and fever and fearsome pains until the boiling of the excess subsides.
And when the rot is complete, then the fever and intensity subside. And the cyst does not come with heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it is contained in a membranous sac which is its special container, and it is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a chickpea and becomes like a melon and larger and smaller.
And it is of two types: either fatty or containing moisture, and the colors of the moisture can be many as mentioned in the Classification. So when you proceed to treat the cyst, you should first probe and examine it with the tool called the probe, whose image will come in the chapter after this.
[Determine] the size of the swelling, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after it. If liquid moisture of any color comes out, then make a simple incision as mentioned regarding other swellings, and if no moisture comes out after the probe, know that it is fatty.
Make a cross-shaped incision on it in this form as I have taught you, and hang it with hooks and carefully separate the skin from all sides, and preserve the sac if you can manage to remove it intact with the cyst.
If the sac tears during the operation and you cannot remove it intact, as often happens, then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it, for if anything remains of it, be it little or much, the cyst will return in most cases.
If you are overcome and a small amount remains, sprinkle the wound when you finish with some sharp caustic powders and bind the wound and place above it what will calm the hot swelling and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If the cyst was large, suture its edges and treat it with what will cause it to heal.
If you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vessel and bleeding occurs, quickly fill the area with crushed vitriol and leave it bound for two or three days until the wound becomes scarred and the blood's boiling subsides, then return to cutting what remains of the cyst.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On the Forms of Instruments.
Those used in incision and lancing include probes, which are of three types: large, medium, and small.
Form of a large probe:
Form of a medium probe:
Form of a small probe:
They are made of steel, with square ends, precisely crafted to quickly enter tumors. These are the forms of sounds, also called files, and they too are of three types: large, medium, and small. Form of a large sound:
Form of a medium sound:
Form of a small sound:
They are suitable for examining tumors, wounds, fistulas, and hidden places for bones and other things inside. They are made round, polished, smooth like needles, from Chinese copper, or spodumene, or copper, or iron, or silver, and the best are those made from spodumene.
Sounds are also made from black lead and are suitable for probing fistulas that have curves in their depths, as they bend flexibly with these curves. These too are of three types: long, medium, and short.
According to what is needed for the depth of each fistula, and their thickness is made according to the width and narrowness of the fistula. Form of a large lead sound:
Form of a medium lead sound:
Form of a small lead sound:
Forms of hooks, which are of many types: some are simple, meaning those with one hook, and these are of three types: large, medium, and small; and there are blind hooks of three types; and hooks with two hooks of three types; and curved hooks with two hooks.
These are of three types, and hooks with three hooks are of three types, and each of these types is needed in its place. Form of a large simple hook:
Form of a medium simple hook:
Form of a small simple hook:
Form of a large blind hook:
Form of a medium blind hook:
Form of a small blind hook:
Form of a large hook with two hooks:
Form of a medium hook with two hooks:
Form of a small hook with two hooks:
Form of a large hook with three hooks:
Form of a medium hook with three hooks:
Form of a small hook with three hooks:
These are the forms of scalpels used to incise and dissect cysts and tumors, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small. Form of a large scalpel:
Form of a medium scalpel:
Form of a small scalpel:
Their cutting edges are sharp while the other ends are not sharp. They are made this way to help in dissecting cysts when there is fear of cutting a vessel or nerve, and to comfort the patient who finds some relief from the burning sensation felt during tumor dissection.
These are the forms of deceptors, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small. Form of a large deceptor:
Form of a medium deceptor:
Form of a small deceptor:
They are made of copper like the probe used for applying kohl, with one end like a wide spoon made of two layers, having a hidden lancet blade in its head resembling a bird's tongue that can move in and out as desired, as you see.
Forms of lancets that are hidden between the fingers when lancing tumors so the patient doesn't notice them, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small. Form of a large lancet:
Form of a medium lancet:
Form of a small lancet:
Forms of cupping glasses used to stop bleeding, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small. Form of a large cupping glass:
Form of a medium cupping glass:
Form of a small cupping glass:
It is made of copper or porcelain, slightly elongated in shape as you see, and should be thin. You should have these types of cups in different sizes, large and small, to stop bleeding quickly when necessary and when no medicine is available.
However, do not use it to stop bleeding in every part of the body, but rather use it in fleshy areas such as the leg muscles, thigh, arm muscles, breast, abdomen, groin, and similar moist, fleshy organs.
Other small instruments can be made from it resembling pistachio shells, in this form:
It stops bleeding when it occurs from the site of bloodletting or when cutting a vein or artery, and it can be made round in this form:
Chapter Forty-Seven
On the Treatment of Men's Breasts
Which resembles women's breasts - some people's breasts swell at puberty until they resemble women's breasts, remaining swollen and unsightly. For those who dislike this, make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this shape:
From line B to line C:
Then peel away all the fat, then fill the wound with healing medicine, then join the wound lips with stitches and treat until it heals. If the breast droops downward and becomes loose due to its size, as happens with women.
You should make two crescent-shaped incisions in its upper sides, each connecting to the other at their ends, so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one, in this form:
From line B to line C, then peel the skin between the two incisions and remove the fat, and use what we mentioned of stitching and powders and whatever treatment is needed until it heals.
If you cannot complete cutting what needs to be cut due to the patient's anxiety or bleeding, you should stuff the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it consumes the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Eight
On Lancing Tumors That Occur Under the Armpit
These tumors that occur under the armpit are of the scrofulous type, hard and contained in a sac, and some contain fluids. For those containing fluids, make a crescent-shaped incision in this form:
From line B to line C. When you have drained all the pus from the tumor, stuff it with old cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
Treat with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the scrofulous node type, make an incision as we mentioned for scrofulous tumors exactly. If the wound persists until it produces pus, use cauterization as we mentioned previously.
Chapter Forty-Nine
On Incising Tumors That Occur Due to Arteries or Veins, Called Aneurysm
When an artery is wounded and the skin above it heals, a tumor often results, and similarly, a vein can also develop swelling and tumor.
The signs by which one knows whether the tumor and swelling are due to an artery or vein: if the tumor is due to an artery, it will be elongated and concentrated deep in the body, and when you press the tumor with your finger, you feel as if it has a squeaking sound.
That which is due to a vein will be round and on the surface of the body. Incising these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, neck, and many other parts of the body, and if they are very large, you should avoid treating them with the knife.
Also avoid those in the extremities or head. For those caused by dilation of the artery opening, make a lengthwise incision in the skin, then open the incision with hooks, then peel away the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath it and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places as I taught you in removing the arteries in the temples, then pierce with a lancet the area between the two ligatures until all the blood within it comes out.
Then the swelling dissolves, then apply the treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is due to a vein incision, you should hold with your hand as much of the swelling with the skin as you can, then insert a needle below the area you held with your hand and pass it through with a doubled thread until it emerges from the other side.
Then tie the swelling well with it as I mentioned to you regarding tying the grape-like growth from both sides with the ends of the thread, and if you fear the threads might slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling where the first needle intersects.
And tighten your threads in four places then cut the swelling in its middle until when what is inside comes out, cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied, then place on it a compress that you have dipped in wine and oil.
Then use the treatment that involves wicks and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the swelling that occurs from nerve twisting.
Just as swelling occurs in the artery and vein, likewise swelling occurs in the nerve when it suffers a blow or occurs from excessive fatigue or the like, and this happens most often in the areas of the wrists and heel.
And in every place where joints move, it is a firm swelling whose color resembles the rest of the body and is usually without pain, and when pressed firmly the patient feels a kind of numbness, and the swelling is not gathered in the depth of the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and it moves in all directions but does not go forward or backward, and those that are in the joints should not be approached with iron [surgical tools] as it might cause permanent disability, and those that are in the head or forehead.
Cut the skin with a lancet, and if the swelling is small, hold it with forceps and cut it from the root, and if it is large, hang it with a hook and skin it then remove it and join the wound with stitching and treat it until it heals.

Often some people develop on their abdomen and the rest of their bodies warts called mushroom-like because they resemble mushrooms, with a thin base and thick head whose edges have turned over, and some are small and some become very large.
Indeed, I witnessed a man who had two warts on his abdomen that most resembled mushrooms with no difference, white with thin bases and turned-over, cracked edges, with moisture constantly flowing from them, so I cut them and found the weight of one to be about eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces.
The procedure for cutting them is to examine, and if the patient is of moist temperament and the wart is white, moist, and thin at the base, cut it with a broad lancet and have cautery irons ready in the fire as often much blood gushes forth when cutting them.
So hurry if the blood overwhelms you and cauterize it, and if you see the patient is cowardly and frightened of cutting with iron, take a well-made lead thread and tie it around the wart of this description and leave it for two days, then increase the tightening of the lead, and continue to tighten the lead.
Whenever it affects the wart until it cuts through and falls off by itself without effort, but if the wart has a thick base, there is some fear and risk in cutting it, especially what is on the abdomen, but it is possible to cut half of it or some of it.
Then cauterize it so it doesn't return, then treat it until the wound heals, and beware of attempting to cut a wart that is dusky in color, with little sensation and ugly in appearance, for it is a cancerous tumor and we will discuss cancer after this.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On the treatment of protruding navel.
Protrusion of the navel occurs from many causes: either from a split in the peritoneum covering the belly, from which omentum or intestine emerges as happens in other hernias, or from blood flowing from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or from trapped wind.
If it is due to splitting of the peritoneum and protrusion of the omentum, then the color of the swelling resembles the body's color and is soft without pain and appears irregular in position.
If it is due to intestinal protrusion, its position along with what we described is more irregular, and when you press it with your fingers it disappears then returns, and sometimes there is gurgling with it and it enlarges considerably upon entering the bath and with severe exertion, and if it is due to moisture it will be soft.
It does not disappear when you press it with your hand and does not increase or decrease, and if it is due to blood then along with these signs the swelling appears blackish, and if it is due to growing flesh then the swelling is firm and hard and remains at one size.
If it is due to wind its touch is soft, and the procedure in this case is to examine - if the navel protrusion is due to arterial or venous blood or wind, then you should refrain from treating it as there is danger and risk in that, as I informed you in the chapter where I mentioned swellings that occur due to arteries and veins.
If the navel protrusion is due to intestine or omentum, you should instruct the patient to hold their breath and stand upright extended, then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Then order them to lie before you on their back, then make an incision with a broad scalpel around the navel at the place you marked with ink, then pull the center of the swelling upward with a large hook, then bind the incision site with strong thread or silk cord with a firm binding.
The binding should be a slip knot, then open the center of the bound swelling above the binding and insert your index finger and search for the intestine - if you find it has been caught by the binding, loosen the slip knot and push the intestine into the belly, and if you find omentum, pull it with a hook.
Cut off its excess, and if you encounter an artery or vein, tie it off well and return to your work, and take two needles and thread them with strong threads and insert the needles crossed through the incision you made around the swelling, having passed them through, then bind the swelling in four places on the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the site until the bound flesh rots and falls off by itself or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten, then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals, and if the navel protrusion is from flesh growing in it.
Or from moisture, you should hollow out the swelling as we said and extract the blood or moisture you find in it, then treat it with what will heal the site.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the Treatment of Cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines and the warning against treating it with iron lest it ulcerate, and we mentioned cancer occurring in the uterus and the warning against treating it.
The ancients mentioned that when cancer is in a location where it can be completely excised, like cancer that occurs in the breast or thigh and similar accessible organs for complete removal, especially if it is early and small, but when it is old and large you should not approach it.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it nor have I seen before me others succeed in that, and the procedure for it when it is accessible as we said is to begin by purging the patient of black bile several times then bleed them if there is clear fullness in the vessels.
Then position the patient in a position suitable for the procedure then cast into the cancer hooks appropriate for it then hollow it out from all sides along with the skin thoroughly until none of its roots remain and let the blood flow and do not stop it quickly.
Rather squeeze the sites and extract all the thick blood with your hand or whatever instruments possible, and if you encounter severe bleeding during the procedure from cutting an artery or vein then cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Four.
On the Treatment of Dropsy.
We have explained in the classification the types of dropsy, how water accumulates, the signs of each type and its treatment with medicines. The type treated with iron [surgery] is only the ascitic type alone, and the tympanitic type and the fleshy type should never be approached with iron.
For that is fatal. If you have treated this ascitic type of dropsy with medicines and your treatment was not effective, then observe if the patient has become extremely weak or has another illness besides dropsy such as having:
A cough or diarrhea or something similar, then beware of treating him with iron for it is dangerous. If you see the patient has abundant strength and has no illness other than dropsy alone, and is neither a child nor an elderly person, then the procedure is to have the patient stand before you.
And a servant behind him pressing his abdomen with his hands and pushing the water down toward the pubic area, then take a thorny scalpel of this shape:
Sharp on both sides, long with a pointed tip like a lancet, except that it has some slight flatness so that during the operation it doesn't penetrate into the intestines and harm them. Then observe if the dropsy has developed from the area of the intestines.
Then you should distance the incision from the navel by three fingers' width downward in line with it above the pubic area. If the dropsy developed due to liver disease, then make your incision to the left of the navel by three fingers' width. If it developed due to splenic disease, then make the incision on the right side by three fingers' width.
And also the incision should not be on the side that the patient wants to lie on, lest the fluids flow to that weak spot. Then pierce the entire skin with the instrument, then insert the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.
With the scalpel between the skin and the peritoneum as if you're skinning it, and the amount you skin should be about the size of a fingernail or so. Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, which is where the water is, then remove it and insert into the hole the instrument which is of this shape:
It is like a thin reed tube made of silver or copper or steel, smooth and polished, having a small hole at its bottom and three holes on its sides - two on one side and one on the other side as you see.
And its tip is sharpened in the shape of a pen nib of this shape:
At its upper end is a ring, for when the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately flow down the instrument. Draw out a moderate amount of water at the time, because if you draw out more than necessary at once, the patient might die from the dissolution of his vital spirit.
Or he might experience a faint close to death, but draw it out according to his strength and what the patient's condition indicates to you from his pulse strength and his good color. Then remove the instrument and stop the water, for it will stop immediately.
Due to the skin that holds the hole which is on the peritoneum that I told you to incise in that manner. Then return the instrument another day if you see the patient can tolerate it.
And draw out again a small amount of water, do this for days while being vigilant and careful of error until only a little water remains. If you fear for the patient and have left much water, then treat him by burying in hot sand.
And [encourage] profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and have him endure thirst and treat him with drying medicines until he recovers. And cauterize over the stomach, liver, and spleen after drawing out the water as I described previously.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
On the Treatment of Children Who Are Born with Their Urinary Openings Not Perforated or the Opening Is Narrow or Not in Its Proper Place.
Some boys come out of their mother's belly with their penis not perforated, so you should hasten to perforate it from the hour of birth.
With a very thin scalpel of this shape:
Then you place a thin lead nail in the hole and tie it and keep it for three or four days, so whenever he needs to urinate, remove it and let him urinate, then return it. If you don't use the lead, it's possible that the urine flowing over the area won't let it close.
As for one whose hole is narrow, it should be treated with lead as we said for many days until it widens. And those among them whose hole is not in its proper place, such that some are born with the hole at the tip of the penis and cannot urinate forward.
Until he lifts the urethra up with his hand, and he cannot have children because the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight path, and this is a very ugly condition. The method of operation for this is that the patient lies on his back.
Then stretch his penis firmly with your left hand and pare the tip of the urethra with a blade or sharp lancet like sharpening a pen, or as if you're carving something so that its middle protrudes like a penis and the hole falls in the middle as it should.
Be careful during your operation of blood loss as this often occurs, so counter it with what stops the blood and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
On tumors that occur in the foreskin and penis, and blackening and corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.
This tumor often occurs in the urethra and it is an ugly fleshy protrusion, and it can be malignant or non-malignant. For the non-malignant, you should hook it with a fine hook.
And cut it until you clean it all, then apply cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it afterward with palm ointment until it heals. But if the tumor is malignant and ugly in color, you should use cauterization after cutting and scraping it.
If the tumor is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and some of the tumor is inside the foreskin and some outside, you should remove the tumor that's inside first, and when it heals, then treat it from the outside.
Because if you treat them both together, you cannot guarantee the foreskin won't perforate. And blackening and corruption can also occur in the testicles and foreskin, so you should hollow out all that has blackened and is about to corrupt or has corrupted.
Then after that, smear on it honey with ground and sifted pomegranate peels and bitter vetch, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped cautery of this form:
For cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean bleeding and when the wound has corrupted. If the penis is corroded and goes entirely at some point, you should insert a lead tube into the penis passage so the patient can urinate through it. As for adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.
This adhesion only occurs in those whose foreskin is intact and who were not required to be circumcised, and its adhesion can occur due to a wound or swelling, so you should flay it with a flat lancet until the connection is loosened and the penis is freed from all sides.
If it's difficult to separate them thoroughly, you should flay some of the penis and the foreskin, as the foreskin is thin and might quickly perforate due to its thinness. Then separate between the foreskin and penis with a thin linen cloth that has been moistened in cold water so they don't adhere again.
Then treat with astringent wine until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
On circumcising boys and treating what errors occur to them.
Circumcision is nothing other than a disruption of continuity like other wounds, except that since it is done by our will and is used especially in boys, we must prescribe the best operation for it.
And the easiest path leading to safety. I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired.
Through experience, and that is because I found the majority of craftsmen and cuppers using circumcision with the razor and scissors, and using the disk and thread tie and cutting with the nail, and I have tried all these methods.
I found nothing better than circumcision with scissors and tying with thread, for circumcision with a razor often causes the skin to retract, as the foreskin has two layers, and sometimes the upper skin is cut while the lower layer remains.
This necessitates another cut and renewed pain, and circumcision with the disk is not safe from cutting the tip of the penis as it might enter its hole, and as for circumcision with the nail, the skin might slip and your work would be ruined, or the child's skin might naturally be short.
Many are born thus not needing circumcision, and I have seen this. As for circumcision with scissors and tying with thread, experience has revealed its superiority to me because the scissors cut proportionally since the upper blade is like the lower blade.
When you squeeze your hand with the balanced blades, it cuts in one measurement and at one time, and the thread's restraint becomes like a wall for the penile skin from all sides, with no error occurring at all. The first procedure is to make the boy imagine.
Especially if he understands a little, that you are only tying the thread to his penis and will leave it until another day, then cheer him up and please him in every way possible that he can accept with his mind, then have him stand upright before you.
He should not be sitting, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot so the boy's eye never falls upon it or any of the instruments, then insert your hand to his penis and blow into the skin and lift it up until the head of the penis emerges.
Then clean it of any accumulated dirt, then tie the marked place with a doubled thread, then tie a second knot slightly below it, then hold the location of the lower tie firmly with your thumb and index finger and cut between the two ties.
Then quickly lift the skin upward and expose the head of the penis, then let the blood flow a little as it is better and reduces swelling of the penis, then dry it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it ash from burned dried gourd which is the best I have tried, or fine flour which is also excellent.
Then place on top of the powder in a cloth the white of an egg cooked in rosewater beaten with fresh, good-quality rose oil and leave it on until the next day, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And this is the image of the scissors that are suitable for circumcision:
They should be blunt-tipped and cutting with no crookedness, with a well-fitted screw, and the length of the blades should be equal to the length of the handles. As for errors occurring in circumcision, sometimes the inner skin is turned entirely or partially during cutting, so you should extend it immediately with your nail before the area swells.
And cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your nail then pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days pass and what remains under the head of the penis remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the hot swelling subsides and peel it gently.
And cut it as becomes possible for you, and be careful of the head of the penis, for if something of the penis head is cut, it will not harm, so treat it with wound-healing powders that we described in the chapter on powders.
And if more skin than necessary is cut and it retracts upward, this also does not cause much harm, so treat it as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Eight
On the Treatment of Urine Retained in the Bladder
Urine retained in the bladder occurs due to blockage from a stone, clotted blood, pus, growing flesh, or similar things. If you have treated this with what we mentioned of the types of treatment described in the classification.
And the urine does not release and you see that its retention is due to a stone that has moved into the neck of the bladder, then the patient should be made to kneel on his knees, then a man should ride on his back and pull his belly toward his back, and the patient should hold his breath as long as possible.
Then the neck of the bladder will be forced to push the stone backward and the urine will release. If it does not release with what we mentioned and the matter becomes severe for the patient, then you should use extraction with the instrument called a catheter, which is this image:
It is made of silver and is smooth, hollow like a bird's quill feather in the thinness of the probe, about one and a half spans long, with a fine funnel at its head. The method of drawing urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie a piece of wool or cotton to its end with a good knot.
Insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut with scissors any excess wool so it enters the tube and blocks it like a stopper. Then lubricate the catheter with oil, butter, or egg white, and seat the patient on a chair.
Irrigate their bladder and urethra with moist oils or oil and lukewarm water, then insert the catheter into the urethra gently until it reaches the base of the urethra, then bend the urethra upward toward the navel, then push the catheter inside it.
When the urethra is fully bent, push the catheter inside until when it reaches near the rectum, angle the penis downward with the catheter inside it, then push it until it reaches the bladder and the patient feels it has reached an empty space.
This procedure is done in this order because the urinary passage has a curve. Then pull the thread with the wool firmly but gently, as the urine will follow the wool, then remove it and the urine will flow, and reinsert the catheter.
Keep doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine
How to irrigate the bladder with a syringe.
The instruments suitable for this are made of silver or ivory, hollow with a long tube as thin as pus, and if you want to instill waters and medicines into it, this is done with an instrument called a syringe, and this is its form:
It is made of silver or ivory, hollow with a long tube as thin as a probe, all hollow except the tip which is solid with three holes, two on one side and one on another side as you see.
The hollow space containing the plunger should be just enough to seal it without excess, so that when you pull with it any fluids are drawn in, and when you push with it they are expelled to a distance, like the sprayer used to shoot naphtha in naval battles.
If you want to introduce fluids into the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the fluid and pull the plunger upward so the fluid is drawn into the cavity of the syringe, then insert its tip into the urethra as we described for the catheter, then push the fluid with the plunger.
That fluid will reach the bladder immediately until the patient feels it, and this is the form of another fine irrigator with which to irrigate the bladder:
It is made of silver or lead, its upper head resembles a small funnel with a groove below it for the tie. Then take a camel's bladder and put in it the fluid with which you want to irrigate the bladder, then tie it firmly between the two grooves with a doubled thread.
Warm that fluid slightly over fire then insert the tip of the irrigator into the urethra, then press your hand firmly on the bladder with the fluid until the patient feels that fluid has reached the bladder.
If you don't have a bladder available, take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it and puncture it all around its circumference, then insert a strong thread through those holes around the circle, then gather the circle as you would gather a dining mat after you put in it whatever fluids, oils and waters you want.
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing with your hand until the fluid reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On Extracting Stones.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and I described the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and stones formed in the bladder, and the signs of all that, and I mentioned the stones which require manual operation and incision.
These are specifically the stones formed in the bladder and those that get stuck in the urethra, and I will describe that with clear explanation and brevity.
I say that bladder stones most commonly occur in boys, and among their signs is that the urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its thinness.
Sand appears in it, and he scratches his penis and fiddles with it, and often it hangs down then spreads, and the rectum protrudes in many of them, and healing is easier in boys until they reach fourteen years, and difficult in the elderly, while for young men it is intermediate between these.
Those whose stone is larger are easier to treat, and small ones are the opposite of that, and when we proceed to treatment, first the patient should be given an enema to remove all the waste in his intestines, as it can prevent finding the stone during examination.
Then take the patient by his legs and shake him downward to make the stone descend to the neck of the bladder, or have him jump from an elevated place several times, then seat him upright before you with his hands under his thighs to make the entire bladder incline downward, then examine him.
Feel him from the outside, and if you sense the stone in the space, proceed immediately with the incision over it, but if you cannot feel it at all under your touch, you should oil the index finger of your left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.
If he is a full-grown youth, insert it into his rectum and search for the stone until when it falls under your finger, move it little by little to the neck of the bladder, then press on it with your finger and push it outward toward the place where you want to make the incision.
Order an assistant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and order another assistant to pull up the testicles with his right hand, and with his other hand to pull the skin below the testicles away from the site where the incision will be made, then take the sharp scalpel which is of this form:.
And make an incision between the rectum and testicles, not in the middle but toward the left buttock, and let the incision be over the stone itself while your finger is in the rectum and you are pushing it outward at an angle so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, just enough to allow the stone's exit.
No larger, for perhaps pressing the finger in the rectum against the stone during the incision will make it come out without difficulty, and know that some stones have angles and edges which make their exit difficult.
And some are smooth like acorns and rounded, making their exit easy, so for those that have angles and edges, increase the incision slightly, and if it doesn't come out this way, you should try to manipulate it either by gripping it with a firm forceps whose tip is like a file.
To grip the stone so it doesn't slip away, or insert beneath it a fine tool with a hooked tip, and if you cannot manage it, widen the incision slightly, and if blood overwhelms you, stop it with vitriol.
If there is more than one stone, first push the larger one to the mouth of the bladder then make the incision over it, then push the smaller one after that, and do likewise if there are more than two, and if it is very large, it would be ignorant to make a very large incision for it because one of two things will happen to the patient.
Either he will die or he will develop constant urinary dripping because the site will never heal completely, but try to push it until it comes out or attempt to break it with hooks until you can remove it in pieces.
When you finish your operation, fill the wound with frankincense, aloe, and antimony, bind it, and place above it cloths soaked in oil and wine or rose oil and cold water to calm the hot swelling, then have the patient lie on his back and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When it dissolves, bathe the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with palm ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals. If excessive hot swelling occurs in the wound, or erosion and similar issues such as blood clotting in the bladder and urine retention occur, this can be recognized by blood appearing in the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains it will lead to corruption and infection of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type with its corresponding treatment until it heals.
Throughout all treatment times, you should bind the thighs together to keep the medicines placed on the area in place. If the stone is small and has entered the urethra and become stuck there, preventing urine from exiting, treat it as I will describe before resorting to incision.
Many times I have found this treatment sufficient without need for incision, as I have tested it: take a steel probe of this shape:
Triangular at the tip, sharp, inserted into a handle. Then take a thread and tie the penis below the stone so it doesn't return to the bladder, then gently insert the probe's metal tip into the urethra until it reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the probe with your hand against the stone gradually while attempting to pierce it until you penetrate it from the other side, then urine will flow immediately. Then squeeze your hand on what remains of the stone outside the penis, as it will crumble and exit with the urine, and the patient will heal.
If this treatment is not possible due to some impediment, tie one thread below the stone and another above it, then make an incision on the stone in the penis itself between the two ties, then remove it.
Then untie the binding and clean the clotted blood that has accumulated in the wound. The thread must be tied below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the upper tie is so that when the thread is removed after the stone's extraction, the skin returns to its place covering the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin upward so it returns after you finish and covers the wound as we mentioned.
Chapter Sixty-One
On Removing Stones from Women
Stones rarely form in women, but if one of them develops a stone, its treatment is difficult and prevented for many reasons: first, the woman might be a virgin; second, you won't find a woman who would allow herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is chaste or from those who are forbidden to be touched, and third, you won't find a woman who is skilled in this craft, especially in manual operations, and fourth, the location for incision to reach the stone in women is far from the stone's location, requiring a deep incision.
This is dangerous, but if necessity demands it, you should employ a skilled female physician, though they are rare to find. If one cannot be found, seek a chaste and gentle male physician, or bring a skilled midwife in women's matters, or a woman with some knowledge of this craft.
Bring her and instruct her to do everything you command regarding examining for the stone first, and that is to look - if the woman is a virgin, she should insert her finger into her rectum and search for the stone. If she finds it and can press it under her finger.
Then instruct her to make the incision on it. If she is not a virgin but previously married, order the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it well.
If she finds it, she should guide it from the bladder opening downward as far as possible until it reaches the base of the thigh, then make an incision opposite the middle of the vagina at the base of the thigh from whichever side is accessible and where she feels the stone in that area.
Her finger should not move from pressing under the stone, and the incision should be small at first, then insert the probe into that small incision. If she feels the stone, increase the size of the incision enough to allow the stone's removal, and know that there are many types of stones.
There are small and large ones, smooth and rough ones, long and round ones, and branched ones, so know their types to guide you to what you want. If blood overwhelms you, sprinkle powdered vitriol on the spot and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone comes out. Know to prepare for yourself from the instruments that I mentioned for extracting stones from men to assist you in your work. If bleeding overwhelms you and you know from the blood's pulse that it's from a severed artery, put the powder on the spot.
Bind it firmly with bandages and leave it, do not return to it and leave the stone, do not extract it for the patient might perish. Then treat the wound, and when the blood's intensity subsides after days and the area becomes infected, return to your work until you extract the stone.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
On Incision for Hydrocele.
A hydrocele is the collection of fluid in the white membrane that lies beneath the scrotal skin surrounding the testicle, called the scrotum, and it may occur in a special membrane created by nature on one side of the testicle.
Until it appears to be another testicle, and it occurs between the scrotal skin and the white membrane we mentioned, but this happens only rarely. This hydrocele develops from weakness occurring in the testicles, causing this fluid to flow to them, and it may occur from a blow to the testicles.
This fluid can be of many colors: it may be yellowish, or bloody red, or sediment-like black, or watery white, which is most common. The signs by which it is known:
When water collects in the white membrane we mentioned, the swelling will be rounded, slightly elongated like an egg shape, and the testicle is not visible because the fluid surrounds it from all sides.
If the fluid is in its own special membrane, the swelling will be round on one side of the testicle.
For this reason, one might imagine it to be another testicle. If the fluid is between the scrotal skin and the white membrane, it will be palpable. If you want to know the color of the fluid, probe the swelling with the square probe whose image I presented earlier, and whatever comes out following the probe will indicate what's inside.
When we proceed to treatment with iron [surgical intervention], you should order the patient to be bled if possible and if you see their body is full, then have them lie on their back on something slightly elevated and place many cloths beneath them, then you sit on their left.
Order an assistant to sit on their right to pull their penis to one side of the scrotal skin and toward the lower abdomen, then take a wide scalpel and make an incision in the middle of the scrotal skin lengthwise near the pubic area.
Make the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the scrotal skin in half until you reach the containing white membrane. Peel it away carefully without cutting it, and your peeling should be more from the side that adheres to the testicle, and peel as thoroughly as you can.
Then make a wide puncture in the fluid-filled membrane and drain all the water. Then separate the edges of the incision with hooks and pull the membrane upward without touching the containing scrotal skin, and cut the membrane however you can cut it, either entirely or piece by piece.
Especially its thin side, for if you don't cut it thoroughly, you cannot be sure the water won't return. If the testicle protrudes outside its covering during your operation, when you finish cutting the membrane, return it, then join the edges of the scrotal skin with sutures.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals. If you find the testicle has been corrupted by another disease, you should tie off the vessels in the spermatic cord to prevent bleeding, then cut the testicle from the cord and remove it, then treat it as we mentioned.
If the collected water is on both sides, know that these are two hydroceles, so incise the other side as you did with the first one exactly, and if you can do both operations at once, do so. Then wipe away the blood.
Insert into the incisions wool that has been soaked in oil or rose oil, and place externally another wool soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the testicles and lower abdomen, and place folded cloths on top, which are the dressings.
And bind them from above with a bandage that has six ends in this form:
Then take two pieces of cloth, sew them and stuff them with fluffed wool in this example, and make the ends that are tied with wet cotton or wool and gather them by tightening in the trouser belt, and one of the ends takes over the anus to the back.
The second goes toward the pubic area and the two ends on the thighs from below and the remaining two ends on the groins, and gather all the tightening in the trouser belt, and this hernia can also be treated with cauterization instead of cutting with iron.
Take a fine knife-shaped cautery and cut with it the skin of the testicle while it is hot as we described until the white membrane containing the water is exposed, then take another cautery in this form:
Which resembles the Greek eye, then pierce that membrane with it while hot until all the moisture comes out, then extend the membrane with hooks and strip with the cautery the containing layer and cut it as much as you can until you remove all of it, and protect the testicle so the fire doesn't touch it.
Know that this procedure is safer and further from blood loss and better than the cutting procedure, and if during cutting or cauterization you encounter hot swelling or blood loss or something else, you should treat whatever you encounter with the appropriate treatment as previously mentioned.
If the patient is fearful and cannot endure this procedure due to its horrific nature, let him use the puncture as I am describing, and this is when you have confirmed through the signs we presented earlier.
That the hernia is watery, the patient should sit on a high chair then puncture the swelling at its bottom with a wide lancet and make the puncture along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water flows out, then place cotton on the site and bind it.
And leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals, and if the water's exit becomes difficult at the time of your puncturing, it is because the white membrane blocks the wound's opening and prevents the water's exit.
At that point, you should insert into the wound a goose feather or the instrument used to extract water from those with dropsy whose form was previously shown, or increase the wound opening slightly.
Know that the water may return and collect after six months or so, and when it collects, puncture it in the same manner and the patient will manage his days.
Chapter Sixty-Three
On Incision of Fleshy Hernias and Their Treatment
Know that incision on this hernia is among the dangerous procedures leading to death in most cases, therefore we see leaving it and staying safe from it, and I will mention the procedure for it and types of swelling.
I say that many swellings occur in the bodies that make up the testicles, and this happens from many causes, either from sharp excess flowing to the testicles or from a blow, and the swelling's color matches the body color and no water is found in it.
The swelling is firm and sometimes the swelling is hardened with a dull color and has no sensation, and it may be from knotted arteries and their inflation as previously mentioned or from vein inflation, and what comes from arterial inflation is known by the swelling's dissipation.
When you press it with your fingers and it should not be interfered with at all, and as for what comes from vein inflation, nothing dissipates from it when pressed with fingers, and this type can be cut into along with other flesh.
And it is that you cut the skin of the testicle then pull the testicle upward and remove it from the white membrane and separate the hanging part from the vessels and tie the vessels and cut the hanging part after separating it from all sides of the testicle, and if the testicle has fused with those growing flesh.
You should remove the testicle and cut it, and if there is adhesion between any of the membranes or between the vessels, you should detach all of that adhesion and cut it in a circular manner.
If there is flesh growth in the place of adhesion which is from behind, you should cut all of it and remove the testicle as we said, and when your work is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Four.
On the Treatment of Hydrocele with Varicocele.
Varicocele is a somewhat twisted swelling resembling a cluster [of grapes] with relaxation of the testicles, making movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient, and in treating this condition there is risk similar to what was mentioned before.
But we should mention the procedure for it as the ancients did, so I say that you should seat the patient on a high chair, then push the testicular suspension downward, then hold the skin of the testicle with your fingers along with the vessels that are close to the penis.
Another assistant should hold it and pull it strongly, then you make an oblique incision with a sharp, wide scalpel along the vessels until the vessels are exposed, then separate from all sides as I mentioned to you in the extraction of temporal arteries, then insert a needle with a doubled thread.
And tie it at the beginning of the areas where the varicocele occurred and tie it also at its end, then make a vertical incision in the middle along the length of the body and remove what has accumulated in it of turbid, corrupt fluids.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds where you want pus to form so that the vessels that nourish one of the testicles fall off, and there is no harm in that, and if the varicocele affects all vessels, you should remove one testicle with the vessels so that the testicle is not deprived of nutrition.
Before cutting the vessels so it doesn't wither and become useless.
Chapter Sixty-Five.
On the Treatment of Intestinal Hernia.
This hernia occurs from a split that happens in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen near the groins from the lower abdomen, so the intestine flows from that hernia to one of the testicles.
This hernia occurs either from splitting of the peritoneum or from its stretching, and these two types occur from many causes: either a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting something heavy and the like, and its sign when it's from stretching of the peritoneum is that it occurs gradually over a long time.
It doesn't occur suddenly and the swelling is even towards the depth because the peritoneum squeezes the intestine, and its sign when it's from splitting of the peritoneum is that it causes great pain suddenly from the start and the swelling is irregular, appearing under the skin nearby.
That's due to the intestine coming out and moving outside the peritoneum, and sometimes the omentum comes out with the intestine so this hernia is called intestinal and omental, and it can occur with wind, and sometimes feces flows in the intestine and gets trapped there, leading to the patient's death.
Because it causes severe pain and gurgling, especially when squeezed, and treating types of this condition with iron [surgery] is dangerous so you should be cautious about undertaking it, and the procedure description is to order the patient to return the intestine with his hand into his inside if it's possible to return.
Then he should lie on his back before you and raise his legs, then you stretch the skin near the groin upward and make a lengthwise incision in all of the scrotal skin, then insert hooks in the edges of the incision according to what's needed to open the incision with them.
The incision should be large enough for the testicle to come out through it, then separate the membranes under the scrotal skin until when the white hard peritoneum is exposed from all sides, at that point insert your index finger next to the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum under the scrotal skin and the second peritoneum and release with it the adhesion behind the testicle, then fold with the right hand to the inside of the scrotal skin while also pulling the white peritoneum upward with the left hand and lift the testicle with the peritoneum toward the incision.
Order the assistant to pull the testicle upward, and you completely release the adhesion from behind, and examine with your finger lest there be any twisted intestine in the hard white membrane, and if you find any of it, push it down into the abdomen.
Then take a needle with thick thread twisted from ten threads and insert it at the end of the membrane beneath the scrotal skin near the incision, then cut the ends of the thread's fold until there are four threads.
Then overlay them on each other in a cross pattern and bind with them the membrane which we said is under the scrotal skin with tight binding from two sides, then also wind the thread ends and bind them tightly so that none of the vessels that nourish it can reach anything to it.
Lest a hot swelling occur from that, and also make a second binding outside the first binding, distant from it less than two fingers, and after these two bindings leave from the membrane under the scrotal skin the size of a finger.
And cut all the remainder in a circular manner and remove the testicle with it, then make an incision below the scrotal skin from which blood and pus can drain as we described previously, then use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound and use the binding we described.
And the white membrane we mentioned may be cauterized after cutting it as a precaution against bleeding, as this often occurs, and leave the binding until it falls off by itself, and if its falling is delayed, then irrigate it with hot water and apply what makes it separate until it falls.
Then treat the wound with the rest of wound treatments until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
Regarding wind hernia: This wind hernia, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron [surgical instruments], though the ancients mentioned to do as we described in hernia with varicocele, which is to bind the vessels gently below after making an incision on them.
Then make an incision in the middle and treat the swelling with what opens it until the vessels fall off, and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
On inguinal hernia.
Hernia occurs in the groin as we said, and the area swells but nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles, and if it does descend, it is minor and returns at all times.
But if time passes, the split in the membrane increases until the intestine and omentum descend into the scrotum, and this occurs from the stretching of the membrane that is in the groin as we said.
That is, the membrane stretches then relaxes and the area swells and protrudes, and its treatment is by cauterization as I described previously.
And it may be treated with iron [surgical instruments] in this manner: have the patient lie on his back before you, then make a transverse incision at the site of the protruding swollen hernia about three fingers in size, then cut through the membranes under the skin.
Until when the white membrane next to it is exposed, take a probe and place it on the protruding area of the membrane and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then stitch the two protruding areas at the tip of the probe from the membrane and join them together with the stitching.
Then withdraw the probe tip and do not cut the membrane at all, and do not touch the testicle or anything else as I taught you in treating intestinal hernia, then treat it with wound treatments.
When the threads break, clean them and heal the wound until it closes, for the membrane will contract and the hernia protrusion will not increase.
And cauterization is better in this location because it is closer to safety.
Chapter Sixty-Eight.
On relaxation of the scrotal skin.
Often the scrotal skin relaxes in some people without the flesh inside it relaxing, and its appearance becomes ugly, so for whoever desires to treat it, the patient should be laid on his back.
And cut all the skin that has relaxed on the thick skin then bring together the lips [edges], and if you wish to first stitch the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches and secure the stitching then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with treatment of other wounds until it heals and the threads fall out.
Chapter Sixty-Nine.
On Castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religious law.
For this reason, I should not mention it in my book, but I mention it for two reasons: first, so that the physician has this knowledge when asked about it and knows how to treat someone affected by it, and second, because we often need to castrate certain animals for our benefit.
Like lambs, billy goats, cats, and similar animals. I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing or by cutting and incision. As for the crushing method, the procedure is that we place the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.
Then you crush them with your hand until they dissolve and cannot be distinguished by touch. As for castration by cutting and incision, you should hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie off the attachments and make one incision on each testicle.
When the testicles emerge, cut them after skinning them, and don't leave any membranes on them except the thin membrane that covers the vessels. This type of castration is better than the crushing method.
Because crushing might leave some of the testicles remaining, causing the animal to still desire mating. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On Treating Intersex Conditions.
Intersex conditions in men occur in two types: one where there appears in the perineal area or in the scrotal skin between the testicles a structure that looks like a woman's vulva with hair, and sometimes urine flows from the one that occurs in the scrotal skin.
As for women, there is one type, occurring above the vulva on the pubic area like small male genitalia protruding outward, one like a male penis and two like testicles. The treatment for all three types:
For the two types in men and the one type in women, one should cut away the excess flesh until its trace is eliminated, then treat it like other wounds until it heals. As for the second type in men where urine comes out through the scrotal skin, there is no treatment for it and no cure at all.
Chapter Seventy-One.
On Removing the Clitoris and Protruding Flesh from Women's Genitals.
Sometimes the clitoris increases in size beyond what is natural until it becomes unsightly and ugly, and in some women it becomes so large that it becomes erect like men's and leads to sexual intercourse.
One should hold the excess clitoris with your hand or a hook and cut it, but don't cut too deeply, especially at the base, lest bleeding occur.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals. As for the protruding flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the uterus until it fills it.
Sometimes it protrudes outward like a tail.
Therefore, some ancients call it the tail disease, and it should be cut just like the clitoris and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
On Treating Imperforate Vagina.
Imperforate vagina is when a woman's vagina is not perforated or when the opening is too small, and it can be either congenital, present at birth, or acquired. The acquired type occurs from a previous condition and can be either from excess growing flesh.
Or from a thin or thick membrane, and it can be either deep in the uterus, or on its sides, or at its top or bottom, and it prevents intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth, and sometimes menstruation. This condition is diagnosed by the midwife's examination.
If the obstruction is visible and close, but if it isn't visible, she examines it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is from a thin membrane and is close to the labia, proceed to pierce it by placing something like pads on the labia, then place both your thumbs.
With the woman on her back, legs spread, then stretch the labia forcefully until the thin membrane tears and the obstruction opens. Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and have the woman engage in intercourse daily so that the area doesn't heal shut again.
If the peritoneum is thick and dense, it should be incised with a wide scalpel resembling a myrtle leaf, and if the blockage is from growing flesh, grasp it with hooks and cut it, keeping with you medications that stop bleeding without stinging, such as acacia, gallnuts, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal too quickly, keep it for days and use a dry cotton wick, then treat with the rest of the healing treatment until it heals, and if other flesh growths occur in the uterus, they should be cut in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, for the cancerous tumor that occurs in the uterus should not be approached with iron [surgical tools] at all.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that occur in women's genitals.
As for hemorrhoids, it is the swelling of blood vessel openings until much blood continuously flows from them, and when hemorrhoids advance they become warts, and I have mentioned in the classification their types and signs, and we mention here.
What of them accepts treatment and what does not accept treatment, and I say that when hemorrhoids and warts are deep in the uterus and not sensible to touch, there is no treatment with iron [surgical tools], and those that are at the mouth of the uterus that can be sensed are those that are treated.
The woman should enter a cold room, then stretch the warts with forceps or rough cloth and cut them from their roots, then sprinkle upon them when bleeding occurs one of the non-stinging blood-stopping powders.
Such as acacia, gallnuts, frankincense and the like, then raise her legs against the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water, and if bleeding continues, sit her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, oak galls and the like, then take barley flour and knead it with honey and vinegar.
And compress it on her back, and if the bleeding stops, fine, otherwise apply cupping glasses to the spine and breasts without scarification, then take wool and soak it in broomrape juice or plantain juice or blackberry branch juice with astringent wine and apply to the area.
When the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals, and as for the red pustules, they resemble the heads of thyme, rough in appearance, and what appears of them should be cut according to what was mentioned for warts exactly and treated until healed.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
On lancing the abscess that occurs in the uterus.
Many types of tumors occur in the uterus such as cancer, hardened tumor, ulcers, abscess, gangrene, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot swelling, and I have mentioned all these diseases and their types and signs in the classification.
We should mention in this article the hot swelling that occurs in the uterus when it is among the tumors that collect pus, how it should be lanced with iron [surgical tools], and you should observe if the pain of the tumor in its beginning is acute with throbbing, inflammation and fever.
And if you see it is red when touched, do not hasten to lance it and treat it with what helps maturation until when these symptoms subside, then the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean on her back.
And gather her legs toward the lower abdomen with her thighs spread apart and place her arms under her knees and tie them with a suitable binding.
Then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument that opens the mouth of the uterus, whose illustration will come later, and when you want to use this instrument, you should measure with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus lest what enters of the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus.
For it would harm the patient, and if the instrument is longer than the depth, pads should be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus, and the screw that runs in the instrument should be placed on the upper side.
You hold the instrument while the assistant turns the screw until the cervix opens. When the abscess appears and can be felt by hand, and if it is soft and thin, it should be incised at its head with a wide lancet once all the pus has been drained.
A soft wick soaked in rose oil or green oil with some astringent should be placed in the wound, with the wick protruding from the incision in the cervix, and clean wool soaked in water boiled with mallow should be placed externally on the uterus and pubic area.
After two days, treat with the appropriate ointment until healed.
The uterus and wound should be washed by injecting water and honey, then with water boiled with licorice root or long birthwort, then return to the ointment. If the abscess is hidden deep in the uterus,
One should refrain from treating it with metal instruments and instead treat it as we mentioned in the classification.
Chapter Seventy-Five:
On teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses when they emerge in non-natural positions.
The midwife should first know the natural form of birth. Among its signs: when you see the woman pushing downward, desiring to breathe air, and her labor becoming easier,
And the fetus emerging quickly, know that this birth is in the natural position, with it emerging head-first and the placenta with it or attached to its umbilical cord. When you see these signs, you should press her abdomen so the fetus emerges quickly.
For when it descends head-first, the placenta descends with it and cleanses well of those fluids. Any birth other than this is unnatural and unfavorable, as the fetus may emerge feet-first, or with hands before head and feet,
Or with one hand or one foot, or emerge with head and hand together, or emerge folded, or sometimes turned onto its back, and other such unfavorable positions. The midwife should be skilled and gentle with all these things and be wary of errors and mistakes.
I will explain each position and how to deal with it so you can recognize and understand it. If the fetus emerges head-first in the natural way but this becomes difficult for the woman, and labor becomes hard for her, and you see her strength has weakened, seat her on a chair and instruct women to hold her.
Warm her uterus with cooked fenugreek and moist oils. Then the midwife should insert a small lancet between her fingers and cut the placenta with it, or cut it with her fingernail until its fluid flows out, and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it doesn't descend, the woman should be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil, then after the enema instruct her to push and make her sneeze with hellebore while holding her mouth and nose closed, and the fetus will emerge immediately. If the fetus's hands emerge first, they should be gently pushed back little by little.
If they cannot be inserted, place the woman on a platform and raise her legs upward, then shake the platform on the ground while the woman is held so she doesn't fall during the shaking. If the hands won't go in and the fetus has died, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie its hands with a cloth and pull them steadily and it will emerge. Regarding feet-first emergence: when the fetus emerges feet-first, these should be pushed upward, then gradually turn the fetus until it's properly positioned, then take one of its feet and pull it gradually.
When both have emerged to the thighs, instruct her to push and make her sneeze with hellebore and it will emerge. If it doesn't emerge as we described, then return the fetus gradually until it's in the natural position and it will then emerge smoothly. If it refuses despite all we described,
Take marshmallow mucilage, fenugreek mucilage, sesame oil, and dissolved gum, beat all together well in a mortar, then apply it to the woman's vagina and lower abdomen, then seat her in lukewarm water up to the hypochondrium.
When you see that its lower part has softened, make a suppository from myrrh and have her use it. When she has held the suppository for an hour, seat her on the chair, then make her sneeze and cover her mouth and nose, and gently press the lower part of her belly, for the fetus will emerge immediately, the fetus emerging on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this manner, work to insert its hands little by little, then have the woman lie on her back and lower her legs while lying on a bed, and fold her arms, then press above her belly little by little.
Then remove the pillows from under her legs until she is positioned lower, and if the fetus does not emerge, take both her legs and move them vigorously, then press above the hypochondrium little by little until the fetus moves upward, then the midwife should insert her hand and adjust the fetus little by little.
And tell the woman to push until the fetus emerges, the fetus emerging sideways with one hand hanging down, work to return its hand, and if you cannot return it, make the woman stand and have her walk, and if she cannot walk, have her lie on.
Her bed and shake her legs vigorously, then apply the emollient I described made from mucilages, and if labor pains come to her, seat her on the chair, then work to return the hand and position the fetus in its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and tell her to push until it emerges.
The fetus emerging on its back with arms extended and its face toward its mother's back, the midwife should hold the fetus's hand then turn it little by little and adjust it gently, and when it is properly positioned, apply to her vulva what we described of oil and mucilages.
Then tell her to move little by little, and when she has done that, seat her on the chair and tell her to lean to the right side, then tell her to push and make her sneeze with hellebore and it will emerge, the fetus emerging upright on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the uterus in this manner with the placenta, tear the placenta with your nail until it empties of fluid, and if it clings to the fetus's face and neck, cut it from the navel lest it suffocate and die, then push the fetus inward until you position it as needed.
And tell the woman to push several times and it will emerge easily, the emergence of twins or multiple fetuses, know that twins are often born and sometimes three or four are born and live, though this is rare, and as for five, it is something unnatural and they do not survive at all.
They are surrounded, even if numerous, by a single placenta and are separated by a membrane barrier between them attached to each one's navel, and they may emerge as a single fetus emerges in a natural, easy emergence, and they may emerge in a problematic emergence as we described.
If some of them are difficult during birth and take on the unnatural positions we mentioned, treat it as we described, and let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and patience and devise for each position what strategy is available to her that leads to safety.
Mention of what forms in the uterus of fetuses that miscarry, there may form in the uterus one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten, and it has been confirmed to me that one woman miscarried seven and another fifteen, all of them formed, that.
By the decree of the Mighty, the Knowing, so all this should be in the midwife's knowledge for perhaps something like this will come to her one day and she will handle it as needed.
Chapter Seventy-Six.
On Extracting the Dead Fetus.
If you have treated the dead fetus with what I mentioned in the classification of treatment and it does not emerge, and you are forced to work by hand, you should observe, and if the woman is of sound strength and does not have any of the symptoms that make one fear her destruction, the woman should lie on a bed on her back.
With her head tilted downward and her legs raised, and a servant should hold her from both sides or she should be tied to the bed lest her body be pulled when drawing the fetus.
Then moisten her womb's opening with moist oils along with marshmallow mucilage, fenugreek, and flaxseed, then the midwife should oil her hand with these oils and mucilages, then insert it gently into the womb, then search for a place to insert the hooks into the fetus, and the appropriate locations for that.
Look, if the fetus is positioned to descend head-first, insert the hooks into its eyes, or nape, or mouth, or palate, or under its chin, or collarbone, or in places near the ribs or under the cartilages.
And if it is descending feet-first, then into the pubic area and middle ribs, and the hook should be held with the right hand with its curve between the fingers of the left hand, and insert the hand gently and plant a hook in some of those places we mentioned.
Until reaching an empty space, then plant opposite it another hook or a third if needed so the pulling is equal and doesn't lean to one side, then pull evenly and the pulling should not only be straight but moved in every direction.
To ease its exit as is done with a tooth when extracting it, and between that the pulling should be relaxed, and if a part becomes stuck, the midwife should oil some fingers with oil and insert them from that direction to turn what is stuck, and if part of the fetus emerges, move the hooks to other locations.
Slightly higher, do this until the entire fetus emerges, and if a hand emerges before others and cannot be returned due to compression, it should be wrapped with a cloth then pulled until when it fully emerges, cut it.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow, and thus should be done with the other hand and the feet, and if the fetus's head is large and experiences compression during exit or has accumulated fluid in its head, you should insert between the fingers a thorn-like lancet.
And split the head with it so the water comes out, or crush it with the tool called the crusher which will be illustrated along with other tools in the next chapter.
Likewise do this if the fetus naturally has a large head, you should split the skull or crush it with the crusher as we said, then remove the bones with hooks, and if the head emerges and becomes compressed at the collarbone, split it so the moisture in the chest flows out.
For the chest will collapse then, and if the chest doesn't collapse and cannot emerge, cut it into pieces as you can, and if the lower abdomen is swollen or has dropsy, you should pierce it until the fluid flows from it.
If the fetus is feet-first, then pulling it is easy and aligning it to the mouth of the womb is simple, and if it becomes compressed at the abdomen or chest, you should pull it with a cloth wrapped around your hand and split the abdomen or chest until what's in them flows out.
If all the limbs are extracted and the head retracts and becomes stuck, the midwife should insert the left hand, and if the mouth of the womb is open, insert the hand into the neck of the womb and search for the head and pull it with the fingers to the mouth of the womb, then insert into it one or two hooks and pull it with them.
If the mouth of the womb has closed due to hot inflammation that occurred in it, you should not be forceful with it, but rather then use the pouring of moist, greasy substances and use poultices and have her sit in waters that relax and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, if it can be straightened then use what we mentioned for the living fetus, and if that's not possible then cut it into pieces and remove it, and nothing from the placenta should be left inside at all, and when you finish your treatment, use what we mentioned of treatment for hot inflammations that occur in wombs.
And if bleeding occurs, have her descend into astringent waters and use the rest of the treatment, and I have witnessed a woman who was pregnant and the fetus died inside her, then she became pregnant again on top of it another time.
Then the other fetus also died, and after a long time she developed a swelling in her perineum that became inflamed until it opened and began discharging pus. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound would not heal, so I applied some strong drawing ointments to it.
A bone emerged from the site, then after some days another bone emerged, which surprised me since the abdomen is a place without bones. I surmised they were from the bones of the dead fetus, so I examined the wound and extracted many bones from it, bones from the fetus's skull.
I continued pursuing this until I had extracted many bones, while the woman was in the best of conditions. She lived like this for some time with a small amount of pus discharging from the site. I have included this rare case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the physician-practitioner needs to do with his hands in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-Seven
Containing illustrations of instruments needed for extracting the fetus.
Illustration of a screw device for opening the mouth of the uterus:
This is like the clamp used to bind books evenly - it has two screws at the ends of two wooden pieces, except that this screw should be more delicate than the clamp and should be made either of ebony or boxwood, with each wooden piece being two fingers thick.
Their edges about a finger's width, their length a span and a half, and in the middle of the wooden pieces are two probes of the same wood type firmly fixed in them, their length half a span or slightly more, and their width about two fingers or slightly more, and these two probes.
These are what enter the mouth of the uterus to open it when you turn the screws. Illustration of another instrument for the same purpose, more delicate and lighter:
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of forceps, except that it has two probes at its end as you see, each probe about a span long and two fingers wide. When you want to open the uterus with it.
Have the woman sit on a bed with her legs hanging down and spread apart, then insert these two probes closed together into the mouth of the uterus while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs, then open your hand with the instrument as you would with forceps, according to how much you want to open the uterus.
Until the midwife can do what she needs to do. Illustration of another screw device mentioned by the ancients:
Illustration of the impeller used to push the fetus:
Illustration of the crusher used to crush the fetus's head:
It resembles scissors with teeth at the end as you see, and it can be made elongated like forceps in this form as you see, with teeth like saw teeth to cut and crush:
Illustration of another impeller:
Illustration of a hook:
This hook should have some thickness to it so it doesn't break when pulling the fetus with it. Illustration of a two-pronged hook:
Illustration of two wide lancets for cutting the fetus:
All these instruments, the more varieties of them available and prepared for the practitioner, the faster his work and the higher his status among people, so do not belittle having any instrument prepared, as it will inevitably be needed.
Chapter Seventy-Eight
On Extracting the Placenta
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with hellebore and cover her mouth and nostrils with your hand. If it comes out with this, fine; if not, take a pot.
Make a hole in the lid and put in it herbs that open the mouth of the uterus such as pennyroyal, rue, dill, chamomile, wormwood, cassia, and centaury - all these medicines or some of them - cover them with water and put them over fire, then place a silver tube over the hole in the pot's lid with the other end in the mouth of the uterus.
Hold it until the steam reaches the depth of the uterus, then make her sneeze as we said, and the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and doesn't come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage.
Then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta, and when she finds it, grasp it and pull it little by little until it comes out. If it is attached deep in the uterus, insert the hand as we described until when you find the placenta, pull it gently little by little with care.
So that the uterus does not fall during strong pulling, rather it should be gently moved to the sides, right and left, then increase the amount of pulling, for it will respond then and become free from adhesion. If the mouth of the uterus is closed, we have described the treatment with sneezing and the treatment with pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware of being violent with it in repeating the pulling, but rather what has emerged from it should be tied to the mouth of the uterus to the woman's thigh, then inject it with the quadruple ointment, for it will cause it to decay after days.
And it dissolves and comes out, except that when it decays, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and this harms the patient, so appropriate fumigation should be used.
For that, some of the ancients have tried fumigation with watercress and dried figs. The form of the device with which the woman is fumigated for retention of menstruation and placenta and such:
It is made of lead resembling a funnel or made of copper, the thin end is placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire and incense placed on embers, hold it until that incense is gone and replace it with another.
Chapter Seventy-Nine
On the treatment of the imperforate anus.
Many children are born with their anuses imperforate, sealed by a thin membrane, so the midwife should pierce that membrane with her finger, or else incise it with a sharp lancet and be careful not to touch the muscle.
Then place on it wool soaked in wine and oil, then treat it with ointments until it heals. If you fear it might seal again, place a lead tube in the opening for many days and remove it when the child needs to defecate.
Anal closure may also occur from the healing of a wound or swelling, so that scar should be cut then treated with what we mentioned of treatment and lead.
Chapter Eighty
On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower parts.
Fistulas that occur in the lower parts are nodules and thickening that occur near the anus from outside or in the space from one of the sides, and the fistula may be one or more.
When that nodule becomes chronic, it opens and discharges watery white moisture or thin pus. Some of these fistulas may penetrate to the passage of feces and to the intestine, and some may be non-penetrating. The penetrating ones can be recognized by what comes out of them of feces and wind when the patient defecates.
Sometimes worms come out of them, and some fistulas, when they are in the space, may penetrate to the bladder and to the urethral passage, and some may penetrate to the hip joint and to the tail bone. And how to recognize a fistula that penetrates to the anus from a non-penetrating one:
Insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe into the fistula made of copper or iron if there is no tortuosity in the fistula. If there is tortuosity in it, insert a thin lead probe or a horse hair.
Until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger. If you don't feel it at all and nothing comes out of the hole of feces, wind, or worms as we said, then know it is non-penetrating and proceed with treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary passage, its indication is the discharge of urine from it and its refusal to heal with medicines. As for if it penetrates to the hip joint or to the tail bone, its sign is the probe reaching there.
If there is no tortuosity to the bone, and finding pain in that direction, and constant discharge of pus from it, and that no treatment is effective and it doesn't heal with ointment - all these penetrating fistulas have absolutely no cure.
Their treatment is futile effort for those ignorant physicians who dare to treat them. As for those that are non-penetrating and not chronic, cure can be hoped for with iron [surgical intervention] as I will describe and as I have tried, which is to lay the patient before you on his back.
And raise his legs upward with his thighs inclined toward his belly, then insert a probe of copper or lead if there is curvature in the fistula until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the anus, you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe with your finger having penetrated by itself, exposed without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then know with certainty that it is penetrating and do not tire yourself with it as there is no cure for it as we said.
They have said that it heals in some people rarely, and among the treatments from which benefit is hoped is to heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula as previously mentioned and insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches near the anus, then repeat it two or three times.
Until you know that all that excess compacted flesh which resembles a bird's quill tube has been burned, then treat it with wicks soaked in ghee until that burned flesh comes out, then treat it with flesh-growing ointments if it heals.
And if not, it will never heal with any other treatment. And if you inserted the probe and it did not penetrate to your finger in the anus, and there was a thick barrier of flesh or membrane between them, and you saw the fistula near the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula.
And you continue with the incision along with the probe while it is in the fistula until you reach with the incision where the tip of the probe ends and the probe becomes free and falls, then clean out all that compacted flesh that resembles a bird's quill tube and don't leave any of it.
Then treat it with flesh-growing ointments until it heals. If blood overcomes you and prevents you from your work due to cutting that flesh, then the best thing to do and the quickest benefit is to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine because cauterization with fire combines two good conditions: burning that excess flesh.
And stopping the blood and drying the moistures, then treat it with wicks soaked in ghee or sulfur ground with oil until the area suppurates and that burned flesh comes out in the pus, then treat the wound at that time with flesh-growing ointments that grow hard flesh.
These are the medicines that have astringency and dry, for when it heals it has been cured and does not return. If the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is far from the body's surface, insert your finger into the anus and examine with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it is a barrier of membrane or flesh, and it was close to penetrating, then the work on it is only by way of ambition and hope, and that is to use one of three approaches: either to cauterize it as we said.
Or to cut it until you reach its bottom so you can manage to insert wicks and treatment from nearby, and do not persist with the cutting lest you cut the muscle surrounding the anus and cause involuntary defecation for the patient, then treat it with what we mentioned and perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or to penetrate that barrier and pierce it after cutting it near the anus as we said, either with the probe or with another sharp-tipped instrument, then clean all that compacted flesh that is in the cut to where you can thoroughly.
Then attempt to heal the entire wound with the cut and the upper opening until it seals and leave the fistula open inside the anus as it will be easier on the patient, and the fistula may perforate in this manner.
And that is when you insert the probe into the fistula and it was on a side of the anus near the body's surface with the skin and the ring of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated tip like a cobbler's needle of this shape:
And insert into it a twisted thread of five threads or so, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom, if it has penetrated into the edge of the anus from inside nearby.
Pull out the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the rectum and extract the end of the thread, then gather both ends together and tie them, leaving them for a day or two. Whenever the thread cuts through the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the thread ends is cut and falls off, then treat the wound until it heals.
If the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate however possible for you, unless it is very deep, in which case you should not do this because of the muscle, lest you cut it. Then proceed with it as we mentioned until it heals.
Image of the thorny scalpel used to cut fistulas - its hook should be very sharp while the other side should not be sharp, lest you cut what does not need cutting, as you see:

On piercing bleeding hemorrhoids, cutting them, and treating fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the rectum, resembling red blisters or like grape seeds, and they can be small or large, with blood flowing from them constantly.
They can be single or multiple, and they can be outside the rectum and at its edges, though these external ones are usually less moist, releasing yellow fluid or a small amount of blood continuously, and are the same color as the body.
The treatment for internal hemorrhoids is to order the patient to defecate and strain until the rectum protrudes and the warts appear to you, then quickly grab them with hooks or hold them with your nail and cut them at their roots. If the hooks don't hold due to their moisture and laxity,
Scrape them with a rough cloth or a piece of goat hair fabric, or pull them with your fingers then cut them, then after cutting sprinkle on them some sharp powders to serve as cauterization, or cauterize them as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the rest of the treatment until healed. If the rectum doesn't respond to coming out, give the patient an enema with slight irritation to wash what's in the rectum and make it come out quickly when the patient strains. As for the external warts outside the rectum, their matter is easy and simple.
It is to take them with your nail or catch them with a hook and cut them, then treat them as we mentioned until they heal. For those who dislike cutting with iron, they should pierce them in this manner: take a twisted thread and put it through a needle.
Then pull the wart upward and pierce it with the needle at its base from the other side, and wrap the thread ends below the needle while it's crossing, and tie the wart tightly, then knot the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all warts but leave one unpierced.
To allow blood waste to flow from it, then place on the rectum a cloth soaked in rose oil or ceratum and place it on the rectum, and order the patient to rest, then leave it until they fall off. When the warts fall off, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
As for treating fissures, they often occur from dry stool and constipation. If chronic and no medicine helps, you should scrape it with a scalpel blade or your nail until it becomes moist and the upper crust that prevents healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it doesn't heal, repeat with stronger scraping than the first time until it bleeds well and peels, then treat it and it will heal.

On treating inverted and non-inverted corns, dry warts, and anthill-like growths.
A corn is a round nodule the color of the body resembling a nail head, occurring throughout the body but especially on the soles of the feet and toes, causing pain when walking.
One should cut around the corn and grasp it with forceps or a hook and remove it from its root, then treat it, and if you wish, cauterize it as previously mentioned in its chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, compacted, round protrusion above the body's surface.
Warts often occur on children's hands. The treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it or pierce it with a silk thread or hair until it falls off. If you wish, you can cauterize it as previously mentioned with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Inverted and non-inverted warts can be removed with the instrument that I will mention in the treatment of formication. As for formication, it is also a small, hardened, thick protrusion on the body's surface that goes very deep, and when cold affects it, one feels something similar to ant bites.
It can occur anywhere on the body but most commonly occurs on the hands. Its treatment is to take a tube from a goose feather or a strong eagle feather and place that tube over the formication until the circle of the tube surrounds it from all sides, then rotate your hand with the tube until you cut around the formication.
Make it go deep into the flesh and remove the formication from its root. If you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube of this shape:
The top of the tube should be solid and twisted toward thinness to make it easy for the fingers to grip and twist it. If you wish, you can cauterize the formication as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization of warts.

On the shapes of instruments used for enemas in treating rectal conditions, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe can be made from silver, porcelain, or cast or hammered copper, and these instruments can be made in small and large sizes according to their users.
Those used for treating small children should be small, and for those with narrow or painful rectums, their syringes should be very fine. Here is the shape of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel where the leather bag is tied should be wide in this manner, with a barrier where the bag is tied as you see, and its lower end that enters the rectum should be solid, very smooth, tapering to thinness, with two holes on one side and one hole on the other side.
The width of the hole should be the thickness of a probe or slightly thicker, and the leather bag in which medicines are placed should be made from an animal bladder or sheep skin, made in the shape of a small dining mat with a diameter of one span.
Many holes should be pierced around it in a circle, with the distance between each hole being a finger's width. Then insert a strong thread made of yarn twisted from ten threads or so through these holes and gather the leather bag like a dining mat.
When medicine is placed in it, it should be tied tightly at the head of the syringe between the two stones, then used for injection. This is the shape of the circular leather bag and holes:
The method of using it for enema is to fill the skin or bladder with medicine that has been warmed to the patient's tolerance - be careful that it's neither too hot nor too cold - then have the patient lie on their back and raise their legs up.
Place a leather mat or sheet under them, then lubricate the tip of the syringe with oil, egg white, fenugreek mucilage, or similar substances, then insert it gently into the rectum. Then an assistant should take the leather bag with both hands and squeeze it firmly until all the medicine in the syringe empties into the intestine.
Then remove the syringe and have the patient raise their legs against the wall. If the medicine urges them to evacuate, they should hold it as long as possible, and if they sleep with it all night, that would be most beneficial. If it was injected for diarrheal conditions and comes out quickly, repeat the enema until they recover.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful swelling in the rectum, the syringe should be very fine and smooth, like those used for children. This is the shape of a fine syringe with its leather attached:
Chapter Eighty-Four.
On the Treatment of Wounds.
I have mentioned in the classification the treatment of what resembles cauterizations, and I will mention here their complete treatment by hand and medicines. I say that wounds differ according to what causes the wound and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The things that cause wounds are many, such as being struck by a stone, cut by a sword or knife, pierced by a spear or stick or arrow, and many other such things.
As for wounds according to body locations, they are like wounds that occur on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and similar organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a standard and rule for other wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds in particular because compound wounds will be mentioned in the first section of the third chapter of this book.
I say that when a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no bone fracture, I examine it. If it was from the strike of a stone or similar, and it only bruised the skin, and the wound was large, and you fear the occurrence of hot swelling in the patient, then proceed immediately to perform venesection of the cephalic vein.
Do not delay this and draw blood according to his strength if there is no impediment to bloodletting, especially if the blood coming from the wound is minimal, and let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drink, and thick foods. If there is an impediment to bloodletting, then let him reduce food intake and avoid meats and drinks, and apply to the wound, if hot swelling occurs, cotton soaked in rose oil alone or with astringent wine.
If you are safe from hot swelling, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and the air has not altered it, the powder which I will describe to you shortly. But if the air has altered it, apply some ointments to it.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large and was from a sword cut or similar, and its lips do not come together with bandages, then join it with sutures as I will describe in the suturing of abdominal wounds.
If the skin exposes the bone and is hanging, with only a small attachment remaining, then cut it off and treat the wound with medicines that will generate firm flesh in place of the skin, and order the patient to nourish himself with foods that have substance like heads and harisa and similar items.
If decay occurs in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, cut off all the decayed part and discard it, then treat it. If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding and the blood does not stop with medicines, then search for the artery.
If you find it and it's not completely severed, then sever it with the lancet and tie it, and if necessity demands when what we mentioned doesn't help, then cauterize it until the blood stops. If these wounds are small and simple, their matter is easy and straightforward, sufficient to treat them by sprinkling this powder on them while they have their blood.
Before the air alters them, the recipe for the powder is to take one part frankincense, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts of slaked or unslaked lime, grind all together and sift, and fill the wound with it and bind it well until it adheres to it properly.
And it congeals with the blood, then bind it from above with bandages and leave it without loosening it as long as it doesn't swell, for the medicine will not detach from it until it heals. And lime alone can do this if frankincense and dragon's blood are not available to you.
This also has the same effect in many large wounds when its application and binding are done properly, and the wounds are fresh with their blood and the air has not altered them. But if the air has altered them somewhat, especially if it is in summer time.
Then there is no point in applying this powder, so treat it as we mentioned by applying some ripening ointments or apply to it a porridge made from barley flour made with water and honey until pus forms, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
As for if a bone fracture occurs with the wound and it was minor, then pull it with forceps. I have mentioned the treatment of head fractures in what follows, in the section on neck wounds. If the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a head wound if it is simple.
But if it has cut a nerve from the neck or an artery, if it is a nerve, there is no solution except to avoid treating it with strongly astringent substances like verdigris and vitriol and similar things because they harm the nerve and cause it to spasm.
And nothing cold should be placed on the wound at all because the substance of the nerve is cold and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs, and what you treat it with should be from soft medicines like lime washed with fresh water multiple times, moistened with oil or rose oil and tutty.
If also washed with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner and moist ointments, and if the wound is large, use stitching or press its edges together with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has depth and there is a cavity at its bottom where pus has collected, then lance it at its lowest point, and if an artery has been severed in the wound and you find its blood flowing, then cut it or tie it or cauterize it if necessity demands it.
If the wound has cut some or all of the throat cartilage rings but the jugular veins are intact, then join the skin edges with stitches over the windpipe but do not touch the windpipe itself; rather, align it and return it to its natural shape, then bind it firmly and leave it for days.
Then treat it with astringent and drying ointments until it heals, and if the wound has affected the bone, examine it, and if there are bone fragments, extract all of them or as many as possible, and what you cannot remove, leave it until the wound suppurates and heals and its removal becomes easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle upon it the powder we described, and if bone in the wound has become necrotic and turned into a fistula, treat it as will be mentioned in its chapter, in wounds of the chest and between the shoulder blades.
If it is a stab from a spear or knife and you see it has depth, observe if air comes out of it when the patient breathes, then know it is a fatal wound, but if it has no depth and is fresh with blood, do not apply powder to it immediately nor bind it lest blood becomes trapped in its depth.
The blood might then flow back to the heart and kill the patient, but rather apply a drawing ointment and loosen it twice during the day, and if you don't have ointment available, place old cotton in the wound's opening to absorb what comes out of it in terms of fluids, and have the patient sleep on the wound.
So what collects in it may drain, and if three days or more have passed since the wound occurred and the patient has not developed spasms, nor bad palpitations, nor difficulty breathing, and you see all other conditions are good, know that the wound is safe and treat it with wicks and other treatments until it heals.
If healing becomes difficult and pus continues to flow constantly, know that it has become a fistula and treat it according to its chapter, [have] the patient [lie] on the wound so what collects in it may drain, and if the chest or back wound has persisted, treat it with the previously mentioned stitching.
If it is large, or with powder if it is small, and if it has affected the bone and fragments have been cut from it, examine the wound and hasten to remove those fragments if they are loose, and if they are not loose, leave them until.
The wound suppurates as their removal will become easier, and as for the rest of the wounds occurring in other body parts, their rule in treatment is the rule of what we mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-Five.
On abdominal wounds, intestinal protrusion, and their suturing.
The tear that occurs in the abdomen can be large, small, or medium-sized. From the large one, an intestine or several intestines may protrude, making their insertion and suturing more difficult and challenging.
The small tear is also difficult in another way, as returning [the intestine] becomes harder, and if you don't hasten to return the intestine to its place immediately, it will become swollen and thick, making its insertion difficult. Therefore, the medium-sized tear became the most favorable, as returning the intestine is not as difficult as with these two types.
Know that abdominal suturing has four methods: two general sutures that are suitable for both abdominal suturing and suturing other body wounds, and two other specific sutures that while usable for all wounds, are more specific to abdominal suturing.
I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification. I say that if the wound is small and something of the intestine protrudes and is difficult to return, this is due to one of two reasons: either the smallness of the tear as we said, or because the intestine has become swollen from exposure to cold air.
If this is the case, you should warm it by dipping a sponge or wet cloth in lukewarm water alone or water in which lemon grass, sedge, and spikenard have been boiled, and sprinkle it on the intestine until the swelling subsides.
Wine with some astringency can also do this, and it is better than water alone in reducing swelling. When you see the swelling has subsided, moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled, as this will ease its entry with minimal effort.
If its return remains difficult after this treatment, make a small incision in the tear with the instrument used for cutting fistulas. The first treatment, when possible, is better than cutting, and cutting is only resorted to out of necessity and when other methods fail. This is the shape of the instrument:
One of its ends is curved and sharp, and the other end is not sharp. The thin end is not as thin as a lancet but slightly flatter, and it is an instrument that resembles a small polo stick, as you can see. When the wound widens and the intestine enters, it should be returned to its natural shape.
And its specific place if you can manage that is best. If the tear is wide and in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs higher than their head, and if it is in the upper abdomen, their head and chest should be higher than their lower body.
Similarly, if the tear is on one side of the abdomen, always aim to keep the side with the wound higher than the other side. This should be done for both major wounds and medium-sized wounds.
As for small wounds, position them as is possible for you. Then have a gentle assistant present who holds the entire tear with their hands and brings its edges together, then reveals it bit by bit to the person doing the suturing.
This is the description of one general suture: take one or several needles according to the width of the wound, then leave the width of a little finger from the edge of the tear and insert one needle without thread through the edges of the skin.
Along with the edges of the peritoneum beneath the skin from the inside until you pass it through from that side, having gathered the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, making four layers. Then tie with a doubled thread around the needle several times from both sides until the wound edges come together firmly.
Then leave the width of a finger again and insert another needle, then secure it with thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with as many needles as needed until you complete closing the entire wound, and let the needles be medium between thick and thin.
Because very thin needles quickly cut through flesh and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin, therefore they should be medium in both thinness and thickness, and the needle should not be inserted very close to the edge of the skin.
Lest the flesh quickly breaks and the wound opens before healing, and also do not distance the stitching too far lest the wound fails to heal, then cut the ends of the needles so they don't harm the patient during sleep and place cotton pads on each side to hold the needle ends.
Leave them until you know that the wound has healed, and this type of needle stitching is thus more suitable for small wounds because their stitching can be sufficient with one or two needles or so.
As for the description of the second common suturing, it is to join the four edges together with stitching - I mean the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the peritoneum - at once with a needle threaded with moderately thin and thick twisted thread, then when you have passed through these four edges with the needle, return the needle from the same side you started from.
So the thread forms a lattice from above the wound, making the stitching similar to the stitching of bags used to tie goods, and make between each stitch a distance of the width of the little finger, and this type of stitching is known to all people.
With this stitching I treated a wound that occurred to a man in his abdomen who had been wounded with a knife, and the tear of the wound was more than a span, and about two spans of the middle intestine had protruded, and the tear was in the middle of the abdomen.
I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours, and the wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered and lived many years after that, going about all his affairs, though the physicians had judged that he would never recover.
Remarkably, I did not treat him with ointment because I was in a place where no medicines were available, so I would place old cotton on the wound twice a day and attend to washing it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two types of specialized stitching, I mention it according to Galen's exact words, which is to begin the stitching from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside, and when you have passed the needle through the skin and through the muscle that runs straight along the length of the entire abdomen.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside in the other edge of the thin part (of the abdomen), and when you have passed it, pass it again in this same edge of the thin part from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum which is on this side and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, and pass it through with your passing through the peritoneum to the edge of the thin part which is on its side until it passes through all of it.
Then begin again from this same side and stitch it with the edge of the peritoneum on the other side and bring out the needle from the skin near it, then return it in that skin and stitch the edge of the peritoneum which is on the other side with this edge of the thin part.
And bring it out from the skin which is on its side, and do this once more and do it time after time until you stitch the entire wound in this manner, and the complete description of this stitching is that you stitch like the furriers' stitching of fur.
By stitching the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin and leaving it once from the other side until you finish, and as for the second type of specialized stitching which Galen also mentioned, these are his exact words.
It involves stitching it as some healers do by joining each part to its naturally corresponding counterpart, connecting the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the edge of the abdominal wall to its other edge, and this is done as I will describe to you.
You should insert the needle into the edge of the abdominal wall closest to you from the outside and pass it through to the inside alone, leaving the edges of the peritoneum, then return the needle and pass it from outside to inside through both edges of the peritoneum, then return it again.
And pass it from inside to outside through the other edge of the abdominal wall on the opposite side, and this type of suturing is better than the common simple suturing which was mentioned before. This is Galen's text verbatim, and some have said that abdominal suturing can be done with two needles.
This is done by threading one thread through them and beginning by inserting the needle from your side and passing it to the other side, then inserting the other needle from the opposite side and passing it through from your side, just like the cobbler's stitch.
Know that when the tear is in the middle of the abdomen, its suturing is more difficult than other areas of the abdomen. As for treating the wound, its treatment follows the same rules as other wounds, such that when you encounter a fresh wound with blood before the air changes it, return the intestine, suture it properly, and apply the adhesive powder.
If the air has altered the wound, apply some of the ointments you have available until it suppurates and the threads fall out, and the peritoneum and abdominal wall heal together, then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it heals.
If you don't have medicines available, apply worn cotton from the beginning of suppuration and change it twice a day as I taught you until it heals, for you won't need another treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple. If you fear that the wound may share pain with the vital organs,
You should soak soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and armpit. If there is pain or decay in the intestine, which often occurs, inject it with warm black astringent wine.
Especially if the decay has reached deep into the intestine and become a wound penetrating its cavity. Know that the thick intestines are easier to heal, and the thin ones are more difficult to heal.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it never accepts healing from any wound that occurs in it due to the abundance and size of its vessels, the thinness of its substance, and its proximity to the nature of nerves. If what protrudes from the wound is omentum and you encounter it fresh, return it just as you would return the intestine.
If some time has passed and it has turned green or black, you should tie it with a thread above the blackened area to prevent bleeding, as there are vessels and small arteries in the omentum, then cut what is below that ligature.
And make the ends of the thread hang from below the wound outside it to make it easier for you to remove and extract it when the omentum falls off and the wound suppurates. Regarding the wound that occurs in the intestine, if a small tear occurs in the intestine,
It may heal in some people because I saw a person who had been wounded in his abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach. The wound became chronic and turned into a fistula from which feces and wind would exit. I began treating him although I did not expect him to heal.
I continued to treat him gently until he healed and the area sealed. When I saw that the area had healed, I feared that something bad might happen to the patient in his abdomen, but nothing bad happened to him at all and he remained in the best of conditions.
He remains healthy, eating, drinking, having relations, entering the bath, and exercising in his service. Some experienced practitioners have mentioned that when a small wound occurs in the intestine, it should be sutured in this manner.
Large-headed ants should be taken, then the wound lips brought together, then one ant with its mouth open should be placed on the wound edges. When it grips and closes its mouth, its head should be cut off as it will stick and not detach. Then another ant should be placed near the first one.
Continue doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then return it and suture the wound. These heads will remain attached to the intestine until it heals and bonds, causing no harm to the patient whatsoever. The intestine can also be sutured with fine thread.
Which is pulled from the animal's intestinal membrane after being threaded through a needle. The end of this thread from the membrane should be gently pulled, then tied to a thin twisted cotton thread, then this thread should be inserted into the needle.
With the intestinal thread, the intestine is sutured then returned to the cavity. This type of suturing with ants and intestinal membrane is done as a matter of hope and expectation.
However, if the tear is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no solution and no cure whatsoever.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
On the Treatment of Sinus and Fistula.
Know that any wound or swelling that becomes chronic and develops into an ulcer that doesn't heal, and continuously discharges pus without stopping, is generally called a fistula in whichever organ it occurs, and we call it a sinus, and the fistula.
It is in reality a hard, white, matted mass without pain, having a cavity like that of a bird's feather.
That is why some call it a quill. Sometimes it is moist, continuously discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture stops at times. This moisture can be abundant or minimal, thick or thin.
I have previously mentioned in the classification when discussing wounds that any ulcer that doesn't heal and doesn't grow flesh is due to one of nine causes: either due to lack of blood in the body, or its poor quality, or because inside it and on its edges there is hard flesh preventing the growth of good flesh.
Or because it is very dirty and unclean, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter feeding it is of poor quality, or because the medicine is not suitable for its treatment, or due to corruption occurring in the country of an epidemic nature, or due to a peculiarity in the country.
As happened in the city of Saragossa where diseases are difficult to mature and swellings are naturally slow to heal, or because it contains one bone or several bones. I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their medicinal treatments in the classification.
Here I should inform you about the treatment of fistula and sinus that is done through manual operation. Know that fistulas can occur in all body organs: some fistulas extend to great vessels and arteries, or to nerves.
Or to membrane, or to intestine, or to bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of the complexly constructed joints like the hand and foot, and some lead near to a vital organ and such.
Whatever fistulas are of this nature are among the diseases difficult to cure that do not accept treatment, and working on them is futility and ignorance. If there are fistulas that have not reached these locations I mentioned, and you hope and expect to treat them.
And you want to investigate this, take a probe of copper or iron if the fistula runs straight and examine it with it. If the fistula has a curve, examine it with a thin lead probe because lead is soft in body.
It becomes easier upon entry and bends towards the curve. If the fistula has many openings that you cannot probe with the instrument, inject one of its openings, for the moisture you inject will flow towards the other openings and discharge from them.
Then thoroughly investigate by whatever means possible to know if there is bone or nerve involved, or if the fistula's bottom is far or near, or if it is a single fistula with multiple openings. Determine all of this to the best of your ability by questioning the patient and noting the pain when you press your hand on the area.
And similar such signs and causes leading to swelling. When you have ascertained all of this with certainty, then proceed to treatment with confidence. Look to see if
The fistula is superficial and nearby, or in a safe location far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the places I mentioned to you. Then cut into the fistula as I described previously and remove what is inside it of hardened matter, corrupt flesh, and excess flesh.
And whatever grows in its opening of flesh or warts and the like, and treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep-bottomed and straight, you should cut into its depth as much as possible, then clean it of all its corrupt flesh.
Then use wicks soaked in caustic medicines and insert them to the bottom of the fistula that you can reach with the instrument. Do this several times until the caustic medicine consumes all the corruption remaining at the bottom of the fistula.
Then heal it with flesh-growing ointments until it heals. If it does not heal with this, then cauterize it as described previously. If the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, examine it and cut into it as I told you, if nothing prevents you such as
A vessel or nerve or vital organ as we said. If the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, scrape it until the corruption is gone, then treat it with what will heal it until it heals. If it does not heal and continues to discharge pus as it did before,
Know that you have not reached all of the corruption to remove it. Uncover everything on it again and thoroughly scrape and clean it to the best of your ability, then heal it. If it heals, good; if not, know that the corruption is in a deep location of decay, so uncover everything on it again.
And thoroughly scrape and clean it to the best of your ability. If the corrupt bone is small and you can pull it out, pull it with the fine forceps suitable for that.
If there are many bones, thoroughly extract them all and do not leave any if you can help it. If you encounter any ligaments beneath them and there is no danger in cutting them, cut those ligaments and flesh if present there and free the bones.
If you cannot remove the bones immediately, apply something to rot it to the wound and leave it for days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones rot. Keep the wound from healing over the incision you made during your operation.
Rather, if you fear this, place upon it cotton soaked in ground sulfur with oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments, for when those ligaments rot and the bones become friable, their extraction and removal becomes easy.
If it is a single large bone like the shin bone or thigh bone or similar, and only its surface is corrupted, scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption is gone, then heal the wound. If a large part of it is corrupted and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, it must be sawed.
And cut all of it to where the corruption ends, then treat it until it heals. And I will tell you about a case of infection that occurred in a man's leg to make it an example and aid in your treatment. This man was young in age.
About thirty years ago, he experienced pain in his leg due to something moving inside his body until the substances reached the leg and it swelled significantly, without any external cause, then time passed with doctors' mistakes until the swelling opened.
A lot of material discharged from it, and its treatment was mishandled until the leg became infected and developed many openings, all of which were discharging pus and bodily fluids. A group of physicians treated him for about two years, but none of them was skilled in surgery.
Until he came to me, and I saw his leg with materials flowing greatly from these openings, and the man had become thin and his color had turned yellow. I inserted the probe into one of these openings, and it led to the bone, then I examined all the openings.
I found them connecting to each other from all sides of the leg, so I hastened to cut into one of these openings until I exposed some of the bone and found it corrupted, eaten away, blackened, rotted, and perforated until the holes reached the marrow, so I sawed what was exposed to me.
I managed to reach the corrupted bone while thinking there was no corruption in the bone other than what I had cut and sawed, and that I had completely removed it. Then I tried to heal the wound with flesh-growing medicines for a longer period, but it didn't heal. Then I returned to expose the bone again above the first exposure.
I found the corruption still connected to the bone, so I sawed what appeared to me of that corruption as well. Then I attempted to heal it, but it neither healed nor closed. Then I exposed it again, and I continued to cut the bone piece by piece and attempt to heal it, but it wouldn't heal, until I had cut about a span of the bone.
I removed it with its marrow, then treated it with medicines, and it healed quickly and recovered. This repetition in the operation and cutting was necessary due to the patient's weakness, low tolerance, and my fear of his death, as he would frequently faint from excessive discharge, but he recovered completely.
Tough flesh grew in place of the bone, his body's condition improved, his strength returned, and he went about his affairs without any walking impairment affecting him at all. If there is a protruding bone in any part of the body that has broken...
You should saw it in this manner: take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone and order someone to pull it upward, and place another bandage of wool thicker than the first bandage.
Then tie it to the flesh below the bone and pull its end so the flesh is drawn downward while you expose the flesh from the area you want to saw, so the saw doesn't harm the flesh, and place a piece of wood or board under the bone from below firmly.
Because if you do this, the saw won't be prevented from cutting the corrupted bone, and the sawing should be slightly above the site of corruption so that if there is corruption in the bone's cavity that isn't apparent on its surface to the senses, you won't need to saw it again.
If the bone is corrupted but not protruding, rather connected to itself with corruption in its middle or in part of it, expose the flesh from all its sides, then place the wood from below, then saw it from the first side where the corruption is.
When you finish sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little distance from the corruption as we said. If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself and saw the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection between two joints, there is no solution other than scraping. If the corruption is in the metacarpals of the hand or metatarsals of the foot, treating it is very difficult, but you should scrape off the corruption however it appears to you and clean it thoroughly in whatever way possible.
By whatever means available to you when not encountering a vessel or nerve. Know that there are many cutters and saws for cutting these bones according to the position of the bones, their alignment, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and porosity.
Therefore, you should prepare for each type of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.
Know that the operations themselves will guide you to the type of instrument you need when you have long experience and knowledge of the various aspects of this craft, for whoever masters the craft and witnesses various types of diseases.
One devises for oneself suitable instruments for each disease, and I will illustrate for you at the end of this chapter several instruments.
Make them examples to follow and measurements to compare with others, God willing. Image of a saw:

Chapter Eighty-Seven
On Amputating Limbs and Sawing Bones
Extremities may become gangrenous either from external causes or internal causes. If you have treated that corruption with medication treatment and it was not effective, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb with nothing stopping it.
Then you should amputate that limb up to where the corruption has reached so that the patient may be saved from death or from great affliction which is worse than losing the limb. And the sign of one who has this condition is that the limb becomes black until you think fire has burned it.
Or it rots after blackening until that rot spreads to what's adjacent to that limb and begins to affect the whole body, so hasten to cut it. And likewise if the cause of corruption is from the sting of some venomous creatures like sea scorpions or snakes or spiders and such.
If the corruption or sting is in the tip of a finger, cut off the finger and don't allow the corruption to spread to the hand, and likewise if it has taken hold in the hand, cut it from the base of the wrist and don't allow the corruption to spread until it affects the two bones of the forearm.
And likewise if it has taken hold in the forearm, cut the arm at the elbow at the joint itself. If the corruption has passed and you see it spreading toward the shoulder, do not cut at the shoulder at all for in that is the patient's death, and use other treatments as much as possible.
And likewise do with the leg when corruption takes hold in a toe - cut the toe at one of the phalanges, and if it takes hold in the metatarsals cut the entire foot, and if it rises to the knee cut the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee there is no solution except leaving it and surrendering the patient to death. The procedure for cutting or sawing the limb is to tie a bandage below the location you want to cut and tie another bandage above the location.
An assistant pulls one bandage downward and another assistant pulls the upper bandage upward, and you strip away the flesh between the bandages with a wide lancet until all the flesh is exposed, then cut or saw, and you should place cotton cloths from all sides.
Lest the saw touch the healthy area causing the patient excessive pain and hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your operation, quickly cauterize the area or apply some blood-stopping powders then return to your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I will tell you of an example of a man who had this very condition in his leg that I am describing to you, as blackness occurred in his leg with a burning like fire.
This corruption first appeared in his toe until it took over the entire leg. The man hastened on his own, when he saw the corruption spreading in the limb along with the severity of pain and burning he was experiencing, so he cut it at the joint and recovered.
After a long time passed, that same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand. He came to me, and I attempted to repel that excess with medicines I applied to the hand after cleansing his body, but the excess did not repel and began to spread to the other finger.
Until the corruption took over the hand, and he called upon me to amputate his hand, but I refused, hoping to repel that excess. I also feared death for him upon cutting his hand because the man's strength was failing. When he despaired of my help, he returned to his town.
I later learned that he hastened to cut off his entire hand and recovered. I have told this story to serve as an aid regarding what occurs of this type of disease and to be a guide to be guided by and worked upon.
Chapter Eighty-Eight
On the treatment of cavities and how to inject them with medicines.
When a swelling occurs in some fleshy parts and the duration of the swelling extends until pus collects, then it bursts or is lanced and all the pus within it exits, leaving the area empty like a vessel.
And the skin over it is like a rag that has thinned, but the corruption has not reached the point of affecting bone, nerve, or ligament, and from here it deserves to be called a cavity and is not called a fistula unless its duration extends until the corruption affects something of these parts.
At that point it is called a fistula or sinus, and its treatment is to cut all that skin in a circle, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain it will not adhere to the area due to its corruption.
If you hope the skin will adhere and the corruption has not reached that extent, and there is thickness of flesh in the skin, treat it with injection. Look at the cavity - if it is large and the pus that extends from it has a foul smell, inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris in equal parts, combined in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens and becomes the consistency of honey. Then take what you need of it, thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the cavity, bind its opening, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.
Then extract it by squeezing - do this for days until the cavity is cleaned and the foul smell disappears. It may be injected with ash water if this medicine is not available to you, which is to take ash from grapevine wood or oak wood and pour water on it.
Then strain it and inject with it until you are certain that the cavity has been washed. If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ash water, inject it with water and honey mixed with some ground verdigris.
Or inject it with honey and wine mixed, because it is the nature of honey to clean and wash, and wine causes the cavity to adhere, especially if the wine has some astringency and dryness. When you have done this several times and are certain that the cavity's corruption has gone, inject it with what will grow flesh in it.
Such as taking from the palm ointment and dissolving it in rose oil and astringent wine, or inject it with some of the other medicines and ointments whose descriptions we have established in the treatise on ointments. If the opening of the cavity is too narrow to fit the syringe tube.
Then widen it slightly with iron or place in it a wick smeared with Egyptian ointment or lead ointment until it widens, and likewise if the opening is too wide, bring its lips together with stitching and leave only enough space for the syringe to enter, no more.
And likewise, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated upwards, make an incision at its lowest point so the pus flows downward, because when pus is trapped in the depths of the cavity, it prevents flesh from growing in it.
If you cannot incise the cavity towards its bottom as desired, try to position the limb in such a way that pus flows easily according to what's possible for you, and ensure that no pus whatsoever is retained in it.
As for the flesh-growing medications that are placed on the cavity externally and how to apply them: take one of the appropriate flesh-growing ointments and spread it on a linen cloth, and let the cloth be large enough to cover the entire cavity.
Then cut with scissors opposite the cavity's opening a hole slightly wider than the cavity's mouth, then spread some of the soft ointments on another cloth sized to the hole and place it distanced from the cavity's opening to facilitate pus drainage, and do not remove the large cloth except after.
Several days, but as for the cloth on the cavity's opening, that is what you remove each time to let out accumulated pus and to know what discharge flows from it - whether it is abundant or scant, mature or immature.
Additionally, examine the cavity site itself - whether the patient feels pain in it or not, and whether there is swelling or not. If you continue treatment thus and see that the material emerging from the cavity opening is minimal.
Know that the cavity has adhered or is close to adhering, so then unwrap it tomorrow or on the third day, and when you unwrap the wound, replace the cloths with others and renew the ointment. If thin discharge comes from the cavity after a long period, do not despair of its adhesion.
Its healing is near, because among people some are slow in growing flesh in their wounds while others are the opposite. If immature pus comes from the cavity after many days, know that the cavity has not adhered. If the cavity's adhesion is delayed.
And its condition prolonged, increase the drying medications, and let them be medications that are moist in consistency but dry in potency, like the palm ointment when extra vitriol has been added to it. And among the most effective treatments is to take the palm ointment.
And dissolve it in rose oil and sprinkle aged wine of moderate consistency on it, then knead it with it and use it. And this same effect can be achieved when palm ointment is not available by using honey cooked until it thickens, or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, grind all together and sprinkle it on honey while it's on the fire.
Then spread it on a cloth and bind it over the cavity, or apply the honey that you cooked until thick and sprinkle the drugs on it and place the cloths over it and bind it.
And one may use for such cases long aristolochia, blue iris root, bitter vetch flour, and centaury - whether used individually or combined, ground and sifted and sprinkled on the honey I described, then use it. If the cavity's condition persists and isn't cured by this treatment, know that in its depths there is corruption.
And it has affected the bones or other hard nerves or ligaments, so treat it as a fistula as previously mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-Nine
On treating paronychia, the crushed nail, cutting the extra finger, and splitting webbed fingers.
Paronychia is excessive flesh that grows under the nail of the thumb of hand or foot, and sometimes grows in other fingers. If its condition persists and its treatment is neglected, it swells with hot swelling.
Or becomes corrupt and suppurates until it eats away at the nail's root, and sometimes corrupts it entirely, and sometimes the corruption reaches the bone until it has a putrid smell and the fingertip becomes wide and its color becomes dusky. If you treat it with what we mentioned in the classification and your treatment isn't effective.
You should cut with iron all the excess growth from the nail, then cauterize the wound afterward, for cauterization in this case is very beneficial. If the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy.
And if the containing angle of the nail has pressed the flesh inward and began to pierce and harm it, you should place a thin probe under the angle of the nail that is piercing the flesh and lift it up, and carefully cut that flesh.
And place burning, corrosive medicines on what remains of the flesh until it all disappears, then treat it with ointments until it heals. If corruption has affected the bone, you should cut out that bone and remove it, for it will never heal as long as there is corrupted bone in it.
If you see the erosion and corruption spreading in the finger, cut it at one of the phalanges as previously mentioned, then treat it until it heals. If the nail suffers a blow or crush and severe pain occurs, you should first perform bloodletting on the patient.
Then split the nail with a sharp scalpel diagonally from top to bottom, being careful not to reach with the cut to the flesh under the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the patient and it will cause excess flesh to grow in the area, then treat the area with pain-relieving medicines.
As for the extra finger that develops in some people's hands, sometimes it is entirely fleshy, sometimes it has bones in parts of it, sometimes it has a nail, and some grow at the base joint of some fingers.
Or it grows on one of the finger's phalanges, and those that grow on the finger's phalanges do not move, while those that grow near the finger joint sometimes move. Those that are fleshy are easy to cut, as you cut it at its base with a wide scalpel.
As for those growing at the base of the joint, their treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting them. As for those growing on the finger at one of the phalanges, you should first cut its flesh in a circular manner down to the bone, then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the adhesion that occurs between fingers, this happens frequently and can be congenital or occur when a wound or burn heals and the like, so you should split that adhesion.
Until the fingers return to their natural state, then place between them wicks or cloths soaked in rose oil so they don't quickly adhere, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until the area heals properly.
And likewise, if adhesion occurs between some fingers and the palm, split that adhesion according to what is feasible and improves the shape of the organ.
Chapter Ninety.
On Cutting Varicose Veins.
Varicose veins are twisted, thick veins filled with black bile humors that occur in most body parts but most commonly in the legs, especially in the legs of farmers and porters. First, you should purge the body of black bile several times with strong purging.
Then perform bloodletting on the patient's basilic vein. As for treating it with iron, it is done in two ways: one is to cut and remove the black blood, and the other way is to extract the entire vein. As for cutting it, it is done in this manner: first bathe the leg well with hot water.
Until the thick, turbid blood dissolves, then bind the patient's leg from above his thigh to below his knee with a turban, then make wide cuts in the vein in one place or in two or three places.
Then massage the black blood with your hand from the bottom of the leg upward and from top to bottom until you remove the amount of blood you see as sufficient or what the patient's strength can bear, then bind it and order him to avoid foods that generate black bile, and repeat the purging and bloodletting.
When the vessels become filled and this harms the patient, its extraction is done in this manner: shave the patient's leg if it has much hair, then have them enter the bath and pour hot water on their leg until it reddens and the vessel becomes prominent, or have them exercise vigorously.
If no bath is available to warm the limb, then make a longitudinal incision in the skin opposite the vessel, either at its end near the knee or at its bottom near the ankle, then open the skin with hooks and separate the vessel from all sides until it becomes visible to the senses.
When it appears, you will see it as deep red, and when it is freed from the skin, you will see it like a tendon. Then insert a probe under it, and when it is raised and emerges from the skin, suspend it with a smooth blind hook, then make another incision near that incision about three fingers' width apart.
Then separate the skin from over the vessel until it appears, then lift it with the probe as you did before and suspend it with another hook as you did initially, then make another incision or multiple incisions if needed.
Then extract it and cut it at the end of the incision near the ankle, then pull it and extract it until it emerges from the second incision, then pull it to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it from the third incision at the top of all incisions, and when it has all emerged, cut it.
If it does not respond to pulling and extraction, insert a needle with strong doubled thread and tie it and pull it, and insert the probe under it and twist your hand in all directions until it emerges, and be careful it doesn't break, for if it breaks, its extraction will become very difficult for you.
And it will cause harm to the patient. When you have extracted all of it, place wool soaked in wine and rose oil or olive oil on the wound sites and treat it until it heals. If the varicose vein is contracted with twists turning in different directions.
And if it is not straight as we said, you should make incisions on it at each of its twists and turning points, then suspend it with hooks until you extract all of it, and be careful when making your incisions not to cut or wound the vessel as it will make extraction difficult for you, so be as careful as you can.
Illustration of the scalpel used to incise the varicose vein:
Illustration of the blind hook:
It should not have a hook like other hooks and should not be sharp-tipped lest it wound the vessel, and it should be thick at the curve and smooth, because if it were thin it would cut the vessel due to its thinness, rather it should have extra thickness as we said.
Chapter Ninety-One
On Extracting the Medina Worm [Guinea worm]
This worm develops in the legs in hot countries like the Hijaz and Arab lands and in hot, harsh lands of little fertility, and sometimes it develops in other places of the body besides the legs, and its generation is from putrefaction that occurs under the skin.
As snakes, worms, tapeworms, and worms that develop between the skin and flesh occur inside bodies, and the sign of the beginning of this worm's occurrence is that severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the area blisters, then the worm begins to emerge from the site of that blister.
As if it were a plant root or animal, and when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one to two dirhams and tied, leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever any of it emerges outward, wrap it around the lead and tie it, and if it becomes very long, cut some of it and wrap the rest, but do not cut it from its root before it all emerges because if you cut it, it will retract and enter the flesh, causing swelling and putrefaction in the area and a malignant ulcer.
Therefore, it should be managed and pulled little by little until it emerges completely and nothing of it remains in the body, and from some people this worm emerges with a length of five to ten spans.
And it has reached me that it extended in a man up to twenty spans, and if it breaks during your treatment, insert a probe into its opening and make a long incision along the body until all the material inside is emptied, and try to cause the area to suppurate with medications for several days.
Then treat it as you would treat tumors, and this vessel may have many branches, especially if it appears in the leg joint or in the leg itself, causing many openings with a branch emerging from each opening, so treat it as we mentioned in the classification and as previously described.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
On Incision for Worms Generated Under the Skin, Called the Cattle Disease.
This disease is called in some of our countries the cattle disease because it frequently affects cattle, and it is a single small worm that generates between the skin and flesh and crawls throughout the entire body, ascending and descending.
It is perceptible to the senses as it crawls from one organ to another until it pierces wherever it pierces the skin and emerges, and its formation comes from the putrefaction of certain humors, as occurs with worms, snakes, and tapeworms in the belly.
The harm expected from it is that when it crawls in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it might open into it and emerge, destroying the eye, and this occurs frequently. If you want to treat it and remove it, this should be done when it is crawling and perceptible to the senses.
You should bind above and below it with a bandage tightly, then make an incision over it and remove it. If it sinks into the flesh and you cannot find it, apply cauterization with fire to the area until you burn it. The greatest harm to be expected is its destruction of the eye, as we said.
If you see it has reached the head near the eye, bind tightly below it on the forehead, then make an incision over it and remove it. The patient should maintain purification of their body with medications that purge putrid, harmful humors and avoid foods that generate putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
On Incision for the Disease Known as "The Protruding."
This disease which is called in our country "The Protruding" is a pain that occurs in some organs then moves from organ to organ, and I have seen it as I will describe to you.
I was called to a sick woman in some rural area, and she uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in the rope-like vessel of the arm. After I waited an hour, I saw that swelling crawling along the forearm like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as possible, like mercury.
When it flowed from one place to another, the pain disappeared from that location and settled in the shoulder. Then I sat for an hour and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached the other arm. Then she told me that it circulates through her entire body as I had witnessed.
I was amazed at how quickly it moved from organ to organ, and I had never before seen this disease with my own eyes in this manner, though I had seen groups of people experiencing pain that moved from organ to organ, but I hadn't seen it with my eyes as I saw it in this woman.
I could only attribute this to the fact that the woman was from the rural area, with a dry body and exposed vessels, hence that moving wind was perceptible to the senses, and it would necessarily not appear in this way in people of luxury and moist bodies with hidden vessels.
If you want to treat it and the patient feels the pain, if it appears visible to you as we mentioned, quickly bind above and below it and make an incision over it until that confined wind comes out, and cauterize the area.
If you cannot see it with your eyes, treat it by purging the body and with what dispels and disperses winds, such as stinking pills and sagapenum pills and similar medications.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On the Extraction of Arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the locations in the body where they strike. As for their differences in types, some are large and some are small, some are hollow glass and some are solid glass, and some have three angles and four angles.
And some have barbs and some have splinters, and as for those that vary according to the organs they strike, they are of two types: either they strike principal hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder and similar organs.
When an arrow strikes one of these organs and the signs of death that I will describe to you appear, you should avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death will follow in most cases.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not disappeared deep into the organ, extract it and treat the wound. Among the signs of brain injury when an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane covering the brain, there occurs severe headache, dizziness, and vertigo.
And redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue and convulsions and mental confusion and vomiting of bile, and sometimes blood flows from the nostrils or ears, and sometimes speech is lost and voice disappears, and from the wound site flows a white fluid resembling porridge and something like meat water flows from it.
If these signs appear to you, refrain from treating the patient and extracting the arrow if it has not come out. As for the signs when an arrow strikes the heart, it will be near the left breast and feels as if it has been embedded in something solid, not in something hollow.
And sometimes the arrow has a movement resembling the pulse movement, and black blood flows from the wound, followed by cold extremities, cold sweat, and fainting, so know that death is inevitable. And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the emergence of foamy blood from the wound.
The vessels near the neck swell, the patient's color changes, they breathe heavily and seek to inhale cold air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it will be near the small ribs and the breathing will be great with severe pain.
And sighing, and all the shoulder organs move. If the arrow strikes the liver, this is followed by severe pain and blood resembling the liver in its redness flows from the wound. And if the arrow strikes the stomach, sometimes undigested food emerges from the wound.
And its matter is apparent. And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and becomes stuck in it, and something of feces emerges from the wound, or omentum, or a perforated intestine, there is no hope in treating it or extracting the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine comes out,
And something of it protrudes externally and the pain becomes severe for the patient, know that they are perishing. As for the remaining organs like the face, eye, throat, shoulder, upper arm, vertebrae of the back, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they usually survive,
When the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve and the arrow is not poisoned. And I will tell you of some of what I have witnessed regarding these arrows for you to be guided in your treatment. That is that an arrow had struck a man in the inner corner of his eye at the root of the nose.
I extracted it for him from the other side under the earlobe and he recovered without any harm occurring to his eye. And I extracted another arrow from a Jew who had been struck in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had disappeared and I could only reach its small end which attaches to the wood.
And it was a large arrow from compound bows with square smooth iron without flanges, and the Jew recovered without any bad incident occurring in his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic.
This was the one who had two ears, so I made an incision between the jugular veins as it had sunken into his throat. I treated it carefully until I removed it, and the Christian was saved and recovered. And I removed another arrow from a man who had it in his belly, and we thought he would die from it.
When about thirty days or so passed and none of his conditions changed, I made an incision around the arrow, maneuvered carefully around it, and extracted it. He recovered without any adverse incidents. And I saw a man who had an arrow in his back, and the wound healed over it.
After seven years, the arrow emerged from the base of his thigh. And I saw a woman who had an arrow in her belly, and the wound healed over while the arrow remained, yet none of her conditions changed and she found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man who had an arrow in his face, and the wound healed over, and he remained without feeling much pain. And there are many such cases. And I removed an arrow from one of the Sultan's commanders which had struck him in the middle of his nose, having deviated slightly to the right side.
The entire arrow had disappeared, and I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck. I found the arrow wound very narrow, so I probed it with a thin probe but could not feel it. He was feeling a pricking pain under his ear on the right side.
I hoped that pricking was from the arrow's tip, so I dressed the area with a dressing that had drawing and ripening properties, hoping the area would swell and show signs of the arrow so I could make an incision, but nothing occurred in the area to indicate the arrow had reached that spot.
I continued with the dressing for many days, but nothing happened. During this time, the wound closed and the patient remained hopeless about its removal for a period until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose. He informed me of this, so I applied a sharp, caustic medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it and felt the thin tip of the arrow that attaches to the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the arrow's tip became visible to us, and this process took about four months.
Then when the wound widened and I was able to insert forceps into it, I pulled and moved it but it would not come out. I continued to work carefully and tried various instruments until one day I grasped it with precise forceps, whose illustration will come at the end of the chapter.
Until I removed it, then I healed the wound.
The physicians had ruled that the cartilage of his nose would not heal, but I healed it, and the wound closed, and the patient recovered completely without anything hurting him at all. And I will tell you about the method of removing some arrows so you can use it as a standard and guide for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be comprehended through description alone, nor can any book encompass it. Rather, the skilled craftsman measures the many by the few, and what is present by what is absent, and develops new techniques and new instruments for strange occurrences.
When they occur in this craft. So I say that arrows are removed from the organs they are stuck in in two ways: either by pulling from the place they entered or from the opposite direction. Those that are removed from where they entered:
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy area so it can be pulled and removed, and if it doesn't come out at the time it struck, you should leave it for days until the flesh around it decays, making it easier to pull and remove. Likewise if it is stuck in bone.
And if it doesn't come out for you, leave it also for days and return to pulling and moving it each day until it comes out. If it doesn't come out after days, you should drill around the arrow in the bone itself from all sides with a fine drill until you make room for the arrow, then pull it and remove it.
If the arrow is stuck in the skull bone and has penetrated into one of the brain's ventricles, and some of those symptoms I mentioned to you appear in the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until his condition can be assessed after some days.
If the arrow has reached the peritoneum, death is imminent, but if the arrow is only lodged in the bone tissue and hasn't penetrated the peritoneum, and the patient survives for days without developing any of those symptoms.
Then attempt to pull and extract the arrow. If it is deeply lodged and doesn't respond to pulling, use the drills around the arrow as I described to you, then treat the area until it heals. However, if the arrow has disappeared into a part of the body.
And cannot be felt, probe it with the probe. If you feel it, pull it with some of the suitable instruments for pulling it. If you cannot manage this due to the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vessel there.
Then make an incision until the wound widens and you can reach the arrow to extract it. If it has two barbs that are holding it, free the flesh caught in them from all sides by whatever means possible, and if you cannot free the flesh, try to break or twist the barbs until they come free.
When attempting to extract the arrow from any location, use forceps with a twisting motion of your hand in all directions until you free it, and be extremely gentle lest the arrow break and make pulling and extraction difficult. If you cannot manage it immediately.
Leave it for days until the flesh around it decays, then try again as it will be easier then. If you encounter bleeding, use the treatment we mentioned in its chapter, and take utmost care to avoid cutting any vessel, nerve, or tendon, and use ingenuity.
Use every possible means to free the arrow, and do this gently, deliberately, and carefully as I described to you. When pulling the arrow, you should position the patient in the same position they were in when the arrow struck, as this is most suitable.
If this isn't possible, use whatever positions you can. As for the arrow that exits from the opposite side, either some part of it has already protruded externally, or you find the arrow's tip by touch just under the skin and see it protruding.
Make an incision over it, and let the incision be just large enough to accommodate the forceps, then pull it as it will come out easily. If it's stuck in bone, rotate your hand in a circular motion until the arrow affects the bone and widens its path, then pull it.
Otherwise, leave it for days then try again until it comes out. If the arrow shaft is still in it, push it with that, and if the shaft has fallen off and you want to push it, insert the hollow instrument so its cavity enters the arrow's tail, then push it with that.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that enters that hollow, as this will make the arrow's exit easier. If the arrow is poisoned, you should remove all the flesh that has been affected by the poison if possible, then treat it with what is suitable for that.
If the arrow has fallen into the chest, abdomen, bladder, or side, and is close enough to feel with the probe and you can make an incision over it, then make the incision while being careful not to cut any vessel or nerve, and extract it.
Then stitch the wound if it needs stitching, then treat it until it heals. Description of the forceps used to pull arrows:
Their tips are like a bird's beak, made like a file, so when they grip the arrow or something else, they won't let go. They are made in various sizes - large, small, and medium - all according to the size of the arrow and the width or narrowness of the wound.
Description of the hollow pusher:
Description of the solid pusher:
This has a solid tip like a probe to easily enter the hollow arrow and push it.
Chapter Ninety-Five.
On the Phlebotomy of Blood Vessels.
The blood vessels that are traditionally bled in the body are thirty vessels, of which sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating vessels behind the ears known as the temporals, the two arteries that are visible in the temples, and the two vessels in the corners of the eyes known as the angular veins.
And the upright vessel in the middle of the forehead, and the vessel at the tip of the nose, and the two jugular veins in the neck, and the two vessels in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two vessels in the lower lip which are known as the jaharik, and the two vessels under the tongue.
As for the vessels that are bled in the arm and hand, they are five vessels: one is the cephalic vein which is on the lateral side and the common people call it the head vein; and the median cubital vein which is the middle vessel, composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, and the common people call it the body vein.
And the basilic vein which is located on the medial side and is also called the axillary vein, and the common people call it the stomach vein; and the brachial vein which is located on the forearm and is attached to it, and it is the one that appears clearly above the thumb; and the salvatella vein.
And it is the vein between the little finger and ring finger having two branches, and in the leg and foot there are three vessels: one of them is below the knee pit on the lateral side, and the second is the saphenous vein located at the ankle on the medial side, and the sciatic vein located at the heel on the lateral side.
And in the other leg there are three similar vessels, and as for the two vessels behind the ears, the benefit of bleeding them is for chronic catarrh, migraine, ringworm, and chronic malignant head ulcers, and the method of bleeding them is as I shall describe.
Which is that you should shave the patient's head and rub its back in the location of the two vessels with a rough cloth, rubbing it well, then the patient should constrict his neck with a turban until the two vessels appear, and their location is behind the ears in the depressed areas of the head, so you should search for them with your finger and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark there with ink.
Then take a knife-like lancet which is known as the nashl, then insert it under the vessel in the skin until the lancet reaches the bone, then raise your hand with the vessel and skin upward and cut the vessel with the skin in a decisive cut, and the length of the cut should be about two fingers pressed together.
Or thereabouts, and let out the amount of blood you want, then bind them with bandages and leave them until they heal, and their cutting and cauterization has been previously mentioned at the beginning of the book, and as for the two arteries in the temples, the benefit of bleeding them is for chronic migraine, severe headache, persistent ophthalmia, and the flow of sharp humors descending to the eyes.
And the method of bleeding them is as I shall describe to you: the patient binds his neck with a turban until the vessels appear clearly to the senses and their pulse becomes distinct under your finger, then at that point mark with ink, then lift the skin above the vessel upward with your index finger.
And insert the nashl lancet from below and lift the vessel upward and cut it as you did with the other two vessels and let out blood according to your need, then release the patient's constriction and place your finger on the vessel for a while.
Then place cotton and a bandage on it and bind it firmly from above and leave it until it heals, and their mention, cutting, and extraction has been previously mentioned at the beginning of the book, and as for bleeding the forehead vein, its benefit after bleeding the cephalic vein is for chronic facial conditions such as ringworm, ulcers, and unsightly redness.
And the method of bleeding it is as I shall describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the vessel appears, then take the instrument called the axe and this is its form:
Place the protruding spike at the head of the axe on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or similar object, and let the blood flow as much as you desire, then loosen the patient's binding and bandage it until it heals.
It can be opened with a wide lancet, except that the lancet should not be sharp-pointed like other lancets, but rather slightly broad at the tip, and you should cut it at an angle because the bone is close, as the lancet might break if it is thin.
As for the two veins in the corners of the eyes, their benefit is for eye ailments such as scabies, redness, pannus, and facial diseases. As for how to cut them, the patient should bind their neck with a turban, then you cut them while standing at their head, and the cut should be slightly angled lengthwise with a small, somewhat broad lancet.
Since there is no flesh in the area, if the lancet is thin-tipped it might break. Then release the amount of blood you need and place cotton on them and bind them for one night, then loosen them. As for cutting the nose vein, it is beneficial for acute fever.
And severe headache and facial diseases like the red patches that appear on the nose, especially if chronic. The method of cutting it is to have the patient bind their neck, then hold their nose with your left hand and take a thin, long lancet.
Pierce it in the middle of the nose itself between the nose cartilages straight on, because the vein is not visible to the senses there, and the blood will emerge immediately. You should press your hand with the lancet slightly and release the amount of blood you need, then bind it for a night and it will heal quickly.
As for the jugular veins, the benefit of cutting them is for shortness of breath, early leprosy, and black bile diseases that appear on the skin's surface like vitiligo, ringworm, malignant ulcers, and erosive conditions. The method of cutting them is to have the patient bind below them on their neck with a bandage, and the practitioner stands at the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair, then you cut the vein lengthwise with a slightly wide cut, then remove a moderate amount of blood or according to what you see as necessary, then do the same with the other vein, then loosen the bandage.
Bind the two veins with moderate pressure so the patient doesn't choke, and leave it until tomorrow when the wound will heal. As for the jugular veins, the benefit of cutting them after cutting the cephalic vein is that it helps with mouth ulcers, gum disease, malignant ulcers, cracked lips, and malignant ulcers.
That occur in and around the nose. The method of cutting them is to seat the patient in front of you and bind their neck with a turban, then turn their lips and look at the two veins, one of which you'll see on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, and you can identify them by their blackness.
Also, there are thin black veins around them, so cut them with a clean cut. If it's unclear to you and you don't know which they are, aim to cut the largest and most visible ones, and do the same with the two veins in the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, the benefit of cutting them after cutting the cephalic vein is for quinsy that occurs in the throat from uvula disease and mouth diseases. The method of cutting them is to have the patient sit before you facing the sun, and lift their tongue and look under the tongue for a vein on one side and a vein on the other side, and their color is blackish.
Cut them and be careful not to cut too deep because there are arteries underneath them, as bleeding might occur from those arteries. As for the three veins that are cut in the elbow, they are the ones traditionally cut in all people, and cutting them is done in two ways.
Either by piercing with a broad basil-shaped lancet or an olive-shaped one that's thin, or by slicing with a knife-like lancet which is the blade [and this is its shape], the shape of the broad basil-shaped lancet:
It should be wide as you see, suitable for opening thick, prominent, hollow, filled veins that contain thick, turbid blood, and this is the image of the olive lancet:
This lancet is less wide and has a finer tip, suitable for bloodletting from thin veins that contain thin, bilious blood, and this is the image of the needle lancet:
This needle lancet is suitable for incisions and comes in various types, wide and thin, according to the width and narrowness of the veins, and this can be used as a reference for others, and it is well-known among craftsmen.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of its bloodletting is that it draws blood from ailments below the throat and neck near the chest and abdomen. The phlebotomist must be cautious when bleeding it and be vigilant, for there is an artery beneath it, and if he errs and pushes the lancet too deep, he will cut that artery.
This will cause bleeding, therefore its bloodletting should not be done with a piercing lancet but rather with an incising needle lancet. If the basilic vein is not clearly visible, you should avoid it and turn to another, or seek one of its branches.
Or bleed the rope of the arm in its place, for it is clear, and incise it with the needle lancet as we said. If you want to bleed it specifically, before tying the arm, you should feel the area until you recognize the location of the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then tie the arm and make an oblique incision in the vein with the needle lancet as we said, and try to make the strike away from the location of the artery. When you see swelling at the spot you marked with ink while tying the bandage, know that this swelling is the inflation of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood during bloodletting spurting like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, know that it is arterial blood. Then quickly place your finger on it for a long while, then remove your finger; if the bleeding stops, as it often does, bind the arm.
Leave it, and warn the patient against neglecting it, and let him be vigilant and not move it for days until it heals. If the blood doesn't stop and overwhelms you, and you don't have medicine at hand, cut off the artery if it's visible to you, for its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell, split it, take one half and bind it firmly over the vessel with bandages and compresses until the next day. If the bleeding stops, fine; if not, treat it with the aforementioned hemostatic powders. Stopping its bleeding is not difficult in most cases.
Due to the small size of the wound and the effectiveness of the bandage on the arm, know this. As for the median vein, the benefit of its bloodletting is that it draws blood from the top of the head and lower body because it is composed of a branch from the basilic and a branch from the cephalic, as we said.
The phlebotomist must be vigilant when bleeding it because there is a nerve beneath it, and if he pushes the lancet too deep and hits the nerve, numbness will occur that is difficult to heal and may never heal at all. This nerve is often visible to the senses.
If it is hidden in some people and is too thin to be distinguished, you should make your incision with the needle lancet and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, make a longitudinal incision in the vein. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its bloodletting is that it draws blood from the head.
It benefits eye diseases, and for this vein specifically, if you wish to bleed it, pierce it with the olive lancet or the wide basil lancet because it is the safest of all veins, as there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
However, during bloodletting, you should avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and seek the soft spot. It doesn't harm it if it isn't hit on the first strike to repeat the bloodletting multiple times, although it may swell in some people if not bled on the first strike.
But that swelling does not harm him at all. As for the method of bloodletting, its symptoms, and what should be done to improve it - first of all, you should know that bloodletting is either used only for maintaining health.
Or it is used for diseases. That which is used for maintaining and preserving health and preventing the occurrence of diseases should be done in one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the cephalic, median cubital, and basilic veins, and the bloodletting should be done at the beginning of spring when signs of fullness appear.
And the bloodletting should be done on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours have passed in the day. As for bloodletting used for diseases, it has no specific time, but rather whenever need and necessity call for it, whether night or day.
And at any hour and in any season. Children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years, nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled. When someone intends to perform bloodletting for any reason.
One should clean their bowels before bloodletting with a gentle enema if there is much trapped waste, lest putrid waste be drawn into the vessels during bloodletting from the intestines, harming the vital organs. Neither the nauseated, nor the drunk, nor the intoxicated should be bled until that condition passes from them.
One should also avoid bloodletting following indigestion, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual intercourse, fatigue, exercise, staying up late, fasting, and anything that weakens strength, whether physical or psychological. Then examine the thinning of humors before that if the blood is thick.
Through foods, drinks, and medicines if possible. Then enter the bath if nothing prevents it, or exercise somewhat so that the blood becomes thin, and perform the bloodletting in the early day as we said, and strive to free his mind that day from all harmful psychological conditions.
Such as worries, anger, fear, and from all physical conditions like excessive fatigue and exhaustion, sexual intercourse and the like. And prepare for his session the things that people have become accustomed to using, of various perfumes, aromatic plants, entertainment and such, each person according to what is possible for them.
Then the one performing bloodletting should sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion on which the patient sits. Then he extends his arm and the practitioner rubs it with his hand two or three times, then tightens the bandage with the cord, twisting it two or three times, and let the tightening be moderate.
Because when the tightening is not moderate, either excessive tightness prevents blood flow, or if it is too loose it also prevents blood flow. Then after tightening, the patient should rub both his hands together.
Until the vessels swell and become perceptible to the senses. Then the practitioner wipes the lancet with a little old oil specifically, then places his index finger of the left hand on the vein itself slightly below the place where he wants to make the cut, lest the vein dodge and the strike miss.
For among veins, some you find like a tendon that dodges during bloodletting, and some are filled with air, so when you place the lancet on them, they sink beneath the lancet and deceive the practitioner, and the lancet does not open the vein, or if it does open it, the opening is narrow.
Therefore, the practitioner should be steady and deliberate in all these matters. Then lower the lancet, and if it opens the vein on that attempt, good, otherwise repeat it another time slightly below or above that spot quickly if the area has not become swollen.
If it becomes swollen or the patient becomes anxious, leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage as it might bring about hot swelling, and do not enter the bath. Then resume bloodletting if desired. If the lancet pierces and the opening is small and the blood flow is thin.
And if you fear that the amount of blood you want won't come out, reinsert the lancet into the same hole carefully and straight, and increase the opening slightly, and do this quickly before the area swells, for in many people the area swells even with a small opening.
If you see it has swollen, do not repeat [the procedure] at all, for it will not help you at all, and place some oil dregs on it, for it eases blood flow and is better in this situation than the oil itself and than other oils likewise.
Use oil dregs in all your blood-letting of vessels when blood flow is difficult, and theriac al-faruq and shakhzanaya also do this when either is placed on the area, for the blood thins and dissolves if it was thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the blood-letting site, which often happens especially to those who have never been bled except that one time or if the vessel opening was small, then hurry and place a sponge soaked in slightly warmed water and salt on the swelling and bind it for an hour, for it will dissolve.
This should be done after the blood has completely come out from the vessel itself or from another vessel. If some blackness or greenness remains in the area after days, this is not harmful, and if you wish, you can apply some dissolved aloe and myrrh to it.
Or some mint juice and the like. Often swelling and protrusion occur when letting blood from the basilic vein, so place your hand on it, and if you find it flattens when you press on it, that is a bad protrusion, so beware of putting anything we mentioned on it.
For an arterial hemorrhage might occur from it, but dress it with something astringent to harden the area, then treat it with other treatments until it heals. And you should draw blood from each person according to their strength and what appears of the dominant color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it becomes red, and likewise if you see it is thick, let it flow until it thins, and likewise if it is sharp until its sharpness goes away. And for one who is full-blooded and strong and needs blood drawn at once.
The vessel opening should be widened and the lancet should be broad, and for one who is weak, the opposite of that, and you should draw it multiple times and the hole should be narrow. And the best method used in blood-letting is that it should be slanted and oblique, a cut not a puncture.
This type of blood-letting is safe from hemorrhage and nerve cutting, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than transverse and longitudinal blood-letting. And for one who habitually faints during blood-letting, they should be fed before the procedure some bread soaked in sour pomegranate water or oxymel.
If they are hot-tempered, draw their blood in three or four times, and if they are cold-tempered, they should take before blood-letting bread soaked in mebae syrup or in honey syrup flavored with spices or in fragrant wine.
If fainting occurs during blood-letting and its cause is excessive blood loss, they should be given meat water and light fragrant wine, and perfumed with galiya, and their chest should be loosened with it, and use the rest of what we mentioned in the classification in the chapter on fainting.
Which occurs from evacuation. As for one who wants to rest their arm and draw blood again, for one whose blood-letting was for much evacuation and whose strength is weak, the blood should be drawn little by little according to strength over consecutive days.
As for one who wants to rest their arm and draw blood again and whose body is strong, let them do that after seven or nine hours from their first blood-letting. And as for one who wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite direction to which it has inclined, they should rest on the second or third day.
As for one who has much blood in their body that has become hot and sharp and caused fever, blood should be drawn from them at once, and draw the large amount and widen the opening until fainting occurs, after having verified all the conditions for blood-letting.
Place your hand on their pulse while bleeding, lest death occur instead of fainting, for this often happens when the one performing bloodletting is ignorant and becomes careless, and when you want to release the arm and let blood flow again.
When the vessel's opening has closed and blood flow becomes difficult, you should not press forcefully or twist strongly, for this is very harmful. Either leave it until you can let blood again, or remove the clotted blood from the vessel's opening with the lancet's blade.
Or apply some salt dissolved in water, or apply some theriac al-faruq or shakhzanaya, and press gently until blood flows. If the vessel has become swollen, leave it.
Don't touch it until the swelling subsides. If there is a necessary need to let blood again, either let blood above that spot or let blood from the other arm or another vessel.
As for bleeding the rope of the arm (median cubital vein), it is bled instead of the basilic and cephalic veins when they cannot be found or are hidden, as it is composed of both. The procedure is to have the patient put their hand in hot water until the forearm reddens and the vessel becomes clearly visible, then tie above it with a bandage, applying moderate pressure.
Then bleed the vessel at a slight angle, neither across nor lengthwise, and make the opening wide. Make your incision slightly above the wrist joint. If blood flow is difficult, return the hand to the vessel with hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until you achieve your goal. In summer days, you may not need to return the hand to hot water. Letting blood flow into hot water is mostly done in winter time. Bleeding this vessel is safer than all other vessels.
Because there is neither an artery nor nerve beneath it. As for bleeding the basilic vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver conditions. The procedure is to tie the wrist with a bandage or your hand after putting it in hot water until the vessel swells.
And becomes very perceptible to touch, then bleed it at a slight angle. If you cut it completely, this won't harm it, but be careful not to push your hand too deep with the lancet as beneath it are the finger nerves and the area is devoid of flesh. Then return the hand to hot water.
Let the blood flow into it, for if you don't return it to hot water, the blood will clot at the vessel's opening and stop flowing. When you have drawn the needed amount of blood, put oil and salt on the vessel so it doesn't heal too quickly.
You should do the same with every narrow branch. As for the benefit of bleeding it from the left hand, it is beneficial for splenic conditions, and you do the same procedure as with the second one. As for bleeding the saphenous vein, its benefit is for diseases in the lower body such as uterine conditions.
Menstrual retention, kidney diseases, chronic thigh and leg ulcers, and similar diseases. The procedure is to put the foot in hot water and massage it until the vessels become prominent, then tie above the foot joint with the banda (bandage). The vessel's location is near the ankle, visible towards the big toe.
Many branches spread from it on the foot's surface. Bleed it at its widest branch or at the ankle where it converges, as this is better and safer. If you bleed it on the foot's surface, be careful of the nerves beneath it on the foot's surface.
Make your incision at an angle as if you intend to cut it completely, and let the lancet be elevated. If blood flow is difficult, return the foot to hot water and let the blood flow into it until finished. If the one performing bloodletting misses the vessel on the first attempt.
They should try bleeding slightly above, for the area is safe and no harm is feared if you are careful of the nerve as we said. Do the same with the saphenous vein of the other foot. As for the sciatic vein, its location is, as we said, at the heel on the lateral side.
The benefit of its bloodletting is for hip pain when it's caused by hot blood, and the method of bloodletting is to have the patient enter the bath quickly and bind their leg from the hip to four fingers above the ankle with a long, thin turban, for it will only appear with that.
When it appears, let blood from it in whatever way possible - either at an angle, which is better, or cut it completely, or make an incision, for its location is safe, though in most people it is very hidden. If you cannot find it,
And if it's not at all perceptible to the senses, then let blood from one of its branches, which appear on the top of the foot near the little and ring fingers, being careful of the nerves, and release the amount of blood you want.
Then loosen the binding and place cotton on the site of bloodletting and bind the area, for it will heal quickly.
Chapter Ninety-Six.
On Cupping and How to Use It.
Cups can be made of horns, wood, copper, or glass, and cupping is done in two ways: one is cupping with scarification and blood removal, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping without scarification is done in two ways.
Either it can be done with fire or without fire, and the cups used with scarification and blood removal have fourteen locations on the body: one is the nape cups at the back of the head, and the kahil which is the middle of the neck.
The cups of the neck sides, which are both sides of the neck together, and the chin cups which are below the lower jaw of the mouth, and the shoulder cups, and the tailbone cups at the end of the tail, and the forearm cups which are in the middle of the arms, and the leg cups, and the heel tendon cups.
Cupping draws blood from the fine vessels dispersed in the flesh, and for this reason it does not decrease strength like bloodletting does, and cupping should not be used, whether with fire or without fire, in any diseases that come from fullness until the whole body is purged.
If there is need for cupping due to illness or habit, we use it at any time - at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in its middle, and in any season.
This is because among people, when blood increases in them until it needs to be removed by cupping, some find heaviness and headache in their head, and some find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck, and some find itching in their face and sides and darkness and irritation in their eyes, and some find itching in their cupping sites.
And some laugh excessively, and some find the taste of blood in their mouth and their gums swell and they spit blood, and some sleep excessively, and some see in their sleep blood and redness and the killed and wounds and similar things, so whenever we see any of this.
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we order cupping after two or three hours have passed from the day, and as for the benefit of cupping the nape, it benefits heaviness in the head and water flowing to the eyes.
But this should only be done after purging the whole body, and this cupping can be a substitute for bloodletting from the cephalic vein, and one should be cautious about using it on someone with a cold brain or who has catarrh, for it will harm them greatly.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold diseases in their head should not use it, and those who persist in using it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, you should instruct the cupper to lower his hand with the cup slightly downward for fear of causing forgetfulness, and as for cupping the kahil (middle of neck), it is a substitute for bloodletting from the median cubital vein and the basilic vein.
Therefore it benefits asthma, shortness of breath, rupture of the breathing apparatus, coughing, and fullness, and the cupping of the kahil should be raised slightly because if it is placed lower, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
The cupping of the neck veins benefits pains occurring in the head, ophthalmia, migraines, throat pain, and tooth root pain, and it substitutes for basilic vein bloodletting. The cupper should be instructed not to make deep incisions to avoid cutting an artery which would cause bleeding.
Cupping under the chin benefits mouth ulcers, gum disease, and similar mouth ailments, and it can substitute for labial vein bloodletting. As for cupping between the shoulders, it benefits palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
Cupping the inner forearms benefits in ways similar to bloodletting from the three veins - the basilic, median cubital, and cephalic - because it draws blood from all those fine vessels in the flesh, and those fine vessels draw from other thicker vessels until the drawing reaches the three major vessels.
The cupper should be instructed not to go deep with the incision because the area lacks flesh and contains nerves and small arteries beneath. As for the single cup placed on the tailbone, it benefits hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
The cupper should be instructed to use a large cup made of copper because the area requires strong suction, and glass cups might break, and to make multiple incisions. As for leg cupping, it notably reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the entire body and benefits chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, induces menstruation, benefits pustules and boils, and substitutes for saphenous and achilles vein bloodletting, though it greatly weakens the body and causes fainting in most people. The benefit of achilles cupping is similar to that of leg cupping.
The method of applying cups is to first place the empty cup and apply moderate suction, not leaving the cups on for long, but rather placing and removing them quickly so the humors flow to the area evenly, and continue repeating this until you see the area has reddened and opened up.
When the blood's redness appears, then make incisions and gradually resume suction, then observe the body's condition. For people with soft flesh and open pores, one incision should suffice to avoid the area becoming ulcerated.
Instruct the cupper to widen the incision and deepen it slightly, and to moderate the suction with gentleness and slight movement. If the blood is thick, two incisions should be made - the first to open a path for the thin blood and its water content, and the second to complete the extraction of thick blood.
If the blood is very turbid, make a third incision to achieve the goal. In general, if we want to extract a little blood, one incision suffices, but if we want to extract much blood, we make more incisions. If we determine the blood is thick...
The incision should be deep, and the moderate limit in incision is just the depth of the skin. Regarding which oils should be used when applying cups, which waters, and what the person being cupped should avoid - for those with thick, hard, dry skin and narrow pores...
The cupping areas should be oiled with opening, softening, and dissolving oils. If it's during summer, use oils like wallflower oil, violet oil, sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
If it's during winter, use oils like narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or iris oil and similar ones. If the excess is thick and cold, use marjoram oil, pennyroyal oil, moringa oil, dill oil, and similar ones.
If the cupper has wide pores and tender flesh, he should avoid oil, and these people should wash their cups after cupping with rosewater, cold water, nightshade water, gourd water, purslane water, and similar substances. As for those who have blood with excessive moisture,
They should wash their cups with vinegar or myrtle water and sumac water and similar substances. As for those who have thick waste products, they should wash their cups with aged wine or marjoram water or dill decoction or chamomile and similar substances. One should be cautious of cupping in the bath or immediately after bathing.
Rather, cupping should be done an hour or two after leaving the bath, and one should not sleep after cupping. What should be arranged for the person being cupped or bled before and after the procedure.
You must first observe if the person being cupped or bled is of choleric temperament with sharp and inflamed blood predominating, then they should take cooling substances like pomegranate, endive with vinegar, lettuce, oxymel, julep and similar things, and their food should be young chickens and lamb meat prepared as sikbaj and sour dishes and similar foods.
For those of cold temperament, they should drink honey syrup and myrobalan syrup or seeded oxymel, and take aromatic wine of medium age between new and old, and be instructed to eat little, with their diet consisting of young chickens, larks, sparrows, and squabs prepared as isfidhabaj, and on the day of cupping and bloodletting, drink should be more than food.
In some cases, for some people, they should be given theriac or musk medicine or shiltha before cupping and before bloodletting or after it to strengthen the vital organs and thin the blood, but those of hot temperament should not be given these.
As for cups without scarification, these are the cups placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, belly, navel, kidney area, and hip joint, because these organs cannot tolerate scarification, and the purpose is either to draw blood from one organ to another.
Like when we place cups on the breasts for nosebleed, or we use them to release cold wind that has become trapped in an organ, like when we place cups on the belly and navel, for it loosens the organ, warms it, and removes pain by dissolving that wind.
They may be placed on the kidneys when there is blockage or stones, for by their drawing power they might open the blockage or dislodge the stones from their place, and likewise they work when placed on the liver and spleen when wind is trapped in them. These cups may be used empty with suction only.
They may be used with fire, and they may be used filled with lukewarm water in cases of sciatica, where the cup - which should be large - is filled with hot water alone or with water in which certain appropriate herbs have been boiled.
Then it is placed full on the spot and held, removed, and reapplied several times as needed. This is the form of the cup that is used with fire:
Its mouth should be two fingers wide as we have illustrated, and its depth half a span, and it should have in its side, about halfway up, a small hole the size of a needle's entry, made of Chinese copper or yellow copper with thick edges.
Smooth, even, and polished so as not to harm the organ when placed on it, and in its middle there should be a crossbar of copper or iron where the candle with fire is placed. These cups may be made larger than what we described and smaller according to the diseases.
And the age of the user, for the cups for children and thin people are not the same as those for men and thick-bodied people. As for how to place this cup with fire on the organ, it is that you light a well-made cotton wick or small tar candle with fire and place it on the middle of the cross-bar that is in the middle of the cup.
Let the fire rise upward toward the bottom of the cupping glass so that the patient's body does not burn, then place it on the limb with the finger on the hole we mentioned until when we hold the cupping glass as needed, remove the finger.
The vapor will exit through that hole and the cupping glass will release immediately, then light the wick as described and repeat it if needed, but as for the cupping glass used in treating water retention, it has neither a cross rod nor a hole.
Rather, it is used by filling it with water and placing it on the limb only, and this is its form:
And this cupping glass, the larger it is to hold more water, the better.
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
On the Application of Leeches.
Leeches are mostly used on body parts where cupping glasses cannot be applied, either due to their small size like the lip and gum and similar areas, or because the part is bare of flesh like the finger and nose and similar parts.
The method of their use is to select leeches from fresh, clean waters free from contamination, then leave them for a day and night in fresh water until they become hungry and their bellies are empty.
Then first purge the body either by bloodletting or cupping, then rub the affected limb.
Until it reddens, then place them on it, and when they become full they will fall off, and if it's possible to suction the area with a cupping glass it is more beneficial in effect, otherwise wash the area with vinegar then with plenty of water and massage and squeeze it, and if bleeding continues after the leeches fall off and it's oozing, then wet a linen cloth in cold water.
And place it on top until the oozing stops, and if bleeding increases, sprinkle ground vitriol or oak galls or similar astringents on it until the bleeding stops, or place peeled fava bean halves on the area.
And leave them until the beans stick to the area and the bleeding will stop, and if leeches need to be reapplied, those same leeches should not be used if others are available, and if the leeches refuse to attach, then rub the area with fresh blood.
Or prick the area with a needle until some blood comes out then apply them, for when they sense some blood they will attach immediately, and if you want them to fall off, sprinkle some aloe, salt, or ash on them and they will fall off right away.
Book Three.
On Bone Setting.
This section is also among the most important needs in the medical profession, and it concerns setting fractures and dislocations that occur in bones.
Know, O my sons, that this field is claimed by ignorant physicians and common people who have never studied any book of the ancients about it nor read a single letter of it.
For this reason, this art of knowledge has become non-existent in our country, and I have never met anyone skilled in it at all.
I only learned what I learned through my long reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them until I extracted this knowledge from them, then I committed to experimentation and practice throughout my life.
I have recorded for you in this section everything my knowledge encompasses.
And what my experience has confirmed, after I made it accessible to you and freed it from the complexity of lengthy exposition, summarized it to the utmost brevity, explained it with the utmost clarity, and illustrated for you many images of the tools used in it.
As it adds to the clarity, as I did in the two preceding sections, and there is no power except through God, the High, the Great.
Chapter One.
On general principles and comprehensive matters concerning bone fractures that must be presented, and before we begin discussing broken and dislocated limbs one by one, we should mention at the beginning of this section some general statements and points.
You must first understand these and grasp their truth, both you and whoever else is eager to learn this noble craft besides you.
I say that whenever someone suffers a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall, one should hurry first to perform bloodletting or purging or both.
Unless there is a preventing factor such as weakness, or if the person who has this condition is a child or a very elderly person, or if the weather is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then their diet should be restricted to cold vegetables and the meat of birds and young goats, and they should avoid drinks, heavy meats, overeating, and any food that fills the vessels with blood until the swelling is safe and no material is expected to flow to the area.
At that point, the patient should return to their original regimen that they were accustomed to. When the broken bone begins to heal, the patient should eat foods that provide substantial, thick, and strong nourishment with sticky consistency, such as crushed wheat dishes, rice, heads and feet [of animals], and cow stomach.
And eggs and fresh fish and thick drinks and such things, for with this regimen the fracture will heal faster and better. Know that broken bones in strong men and elderly people cannot possibly connect and heal to their original nature ever.
Due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, while bones that are extremely soft like those of young children can connect and heal, but nature grows something like glue around the broken bone from all sides with thickness that sticks to it and binds it until parts adhere to each other.
And binds parts to each other until it becomes extremely strong and solid as it was before, such that nothing hinders its functions.
For this reason, the patient's diet must consist of foods that have strength, stickiness, and thickness as we said. Know that fractures have different types according to the difference in body parts, for a leg bone fracture is different from a skull fracture, and a chest bone fracture is different from a spine fracture.
And likewise all other body parts are different from each other, and we will discuss each type of fracture explained in its chapter, detailed separately from others. The type of bone fracture also differs in itself.
For it may be a clean break without splinters, or it may be a break along the length of the bone with splinters and separated or unseparated fragments, and the fracture may be with a wound and tear in the skin, or the fracture may be a slight crack.
Each type has its special treatment method for setting it, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. Among the ways to recognize a bone fracture are its crookedness, protrusion, being apparent to the senses, and its crackling when you press it with your hand.
If there is no apparent crookedness in the area, no crackling, you don't feel disturbance when touching the bone, and the patient doesn't feel much pain, then there is no fracture there, but it might be a sprain or a mild break or slight crack, so you should not move it with stretching and pressing at all.
Rather, apply the medicines that will be mentioned later as appropriate for the area, then bind it with gentle binding. Know that when a bone breaks and splits in two without developing splinters, but each part has moved away from its companion.
You should hurry to straighten and align it immediately before hot swelling occurs. If hot swelling occurs, leave it for days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it in whatever gentle and skillful way you can.
Know that setting and aligning it is easier than with a bone that has developed splinters. Then it should be bound as will be mentioned. If the bone has splinters, the broken limb must be stretched from both sides, whether it's an arm or leg.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with both rope and hand. Place the limb on a level surface in its natural position until when the two parts of the broken bone are stretched, then work to return those fragments to their places in whatever skillful and gentle way you can.
Be extremely careful not to cause the patient pain or discomfort through your actions, and do your utmost to join the two bones together in the best possible position. At that time, you should touch and feel them with your hand, and if you notice anything abnormal, correct and adjust it to the best of your ability.
Beware of excessive stretching and strong pressing as many ignorant practitioners do, for through such actions they often cause hot swelling or permanent disability in the limb, as I have witnessed from their practice many times.
After alignment, perfection, and binding, ensure that limb remains still and at rest. Warn the patient not to move it while awake or asleep, when turning or shifting, during defecation, and in all movements to the extent possible, and to ensure that the position of the limb is one that prevents pain.
That is, whenever he feels pain or discomfort in the position of the limb, he should move it to a different position where he does not feel pain, while ensuring that this position remains even and straight.
So that no crookedness occurs in the limb when it heals. As for how to bind the broken limb, it is as I will describe to you. Know that broken limbs differ in their size and form - those that are small like the forearm, finger, and radius, and such.
For these, the bandage wrappings should be soft and light, while for thick ones like the thigh, back, and chest, the wrappings should be wide and firm, because a wide bandage adheres to and binds the large limb from all sides evenly without gaps.
Then after completing the alignment, begin by applying the appropriate medication.
Apply soft hemp fibers to the fracture site, then begin wrapping the bandage around the fracture site itself three or four times as appropriate for the limb, tightening your hand slightly with the bandage, then proceeding to the upper area from the fracture site.
With less tightness than at the fractured area, then gradually move away from the fracture site while gradually loosening the binding until you have covered a good portion of the healthy area. Then take another bandage and wrap it also around the fractured area.
Several turns, then proceed with the wrapping to the lower area from the fracture, and let your technique in tightening and loosening the wrap be as we mentioned for the first upper wrapping. Then place between the bandages soft hemp fibers or cloth to straighten any crookedness in the fracture.
If there is crookedness, otherwise don't put anything. Then wrap another bandage over it, then immediately arrange the firm splints over these wrappings if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply what will calm that inflammation and reduce the swelling, leave it for days, then bind the splints at that time. Let the splints be made from wide, carved halves of cane prepared skillfully, or let the splints be from the wood of sieves.
Which are made from pine, or palm fronds, or maple, or persimmon and similar materials that are available. Let the width of each splint be according to this form and this exact shape.
Except that the splint placed on the fracture itself should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints. As for the length of the splint, make it according to what suits the broken limb in terms of its size, whether large or small. The form of the splint:
Then bind over the splints with another bandage exactly as you did with your first binding, then tie it from above with firm threads as we mentioned regarding the binding, such that your binding is tighter at the fracture site.
And the further from the fracture, the less tight the binding should be.
The threads should be moderate in thickness and thinness, and should specifically be of moist linen because if the threads are thick like what I have witnessed from the practice of the ignorant who make their threads from twisted linen strips, it is a great error.
Because the binding with it falls outside moderation, and thin threads are also not suitable as you cannot achieve the desired tightness with them, and there should not be less than a finger's width between one splint and another.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after binding in the healthy areas, place soft hemp or fluffed wool under them so that nothing from it harms him, and if the fracture is accompanied by a wound and a tear occurs in the skin, we will discuss that separately.
Know that not every broken limb should be bound with splints from the first day, for if the limb is large, splints should not be placed on it except after five or seven days or more, depending on your confidence about the occurrence of hot swelling.
This is the description of the poultices that the ancients used to set bones, which are placed on fractures, dislocations, and sprains. Description of a general abbreviated poultice that sets fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, as it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Take mill dust, which is the flour residue that clings to mill walls during the movement of the mill, knead it as is without sifting with egg white, and make the dough neither thick nor thin, then use it.
Description of another poultice that sets fractures, dislocations, and sprains: Take mung beans, ladanum, acacia, rasens, mugwort, and mastic, ten dirhams each, and myrrh and aloe, five dirhams each, and twenty dirhams of tamarisk, and twenty dirhams of Armenian or Roman clay.
Grind all and mix with tamarisk water or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot, then use this poultice, for it is well-composed, sets broken bones quickly, and is suitable for most people due to its moderation.
Description of another poultice also beneficial for fractures and sprains: Take mugwort, mung beans, and white marshmallow, ten dirhams each, myrrh and aloe, five dirhams each, acacia six dirhams, Armenian clay twenty dirhams, grind all finely, sift, knead with water or egg white, and use.
Description of a poultice for joints and bones displaced from their positions, which alleviates their pain and for bone cracks and fractures: Take washed wool, soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, and place it on the site. This poultice does not have setting power.
But it is excellent in calming hot swelling and especially in relieving pain. Description of another poultice that sets broken bones: Take deaf fig leaves and wild poppy leaves, grind them together and apply them fresh. Description of another abbreviated poultice used when the bone fracture is healing.
And you want to dissolve the remaining swelling: Take marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and bitter vetch flour, one part each, grind all and knead with wine if the limb is not hot, and if it is hot, knead it with coriander water or water and use it.
Description of another poultice stronger in dissolution than the first, used when hard swelling occurs during bone healing: Take marshmallow root, flaxseed, fenugreek, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile, one part each.
Grind all and knead with willow water or fresh water or wine, all according to the limb's heat and the subsiding of its temperature. As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book to place on the broken limb during its setting.
Except for cerotum made from wax and oil only, and he described it to be moderate between thick and thin. As for Galen, he saw fit to place on the broken limb during its setting things that have dryness with some heat, such as myrrh, aloe, frankincense, and similar to what we mentioned.
Description of a poultice beneficial for weakness and pain: Take mugwort, chickpeas, cut human hair or bird feathers, marshmallow, and salt in equal parts, grind, sift, knead and apply it. As for the duration that the bandage should remain.
Then he should remove it, meaning that you should observe if the patient doesn't experience pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its position, then don't remove it for many days. But if severe itching, disturbing pain, or swelling occurs in the area.
Then hasten to remove it immediately and don't delay that at all and remove the dressing from it. Then take a soft cloth or wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water and wash the area with it until the itching subsides and the pain calms, then let the limb rest for an hour.
Then apply to it fluffed wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil and bind it on for a night until you are safe from hot swelling and the limb's swelling subsides and its pain goes away, then return it to gentle binding and light dressing and don't bind it as tightly as your first binding.
Be gentle with it until it heals, and if you see that the swelling, redness, pain, inflammation and all symptoms have completely gone and you need the dressing and binding, then restore it exactly as you did the first time. If none of what we mentioned occurs in the limb.
Don't remove it except after three, four, five or seven days, and it may be left for twenty days, all of this according to what appears to you of the limb's condition as we said, until when the fracture has adhered and the flesh has nearly formed over it.
Then increase at that time the binding more than your first binding entirely and also increase the thickness of the patient's food as previously mentioned. If you see the fracture site has dried and thinned more than it should, know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Irrigate it with lukewarm water each time you remove it, and let that be every three days, and lighten the binding a little, for by this action nourishment flows to the limb and it heals quickly. As for what ignorant bone-setters do in breaking the limb again.
If it didn't heal properly the first time and healed crookedly, this is a mistake in their practice and a great risk, and if it were correct the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it, and I have not seen any trace of this from any of them at all.
The correct thing is not to do it.
Chapter Two.
On Fractures Occurring in the Head.
The types of fractures occurring in the head are many, their forms are different, and their causes are diverse. Among fractures is what occurs from a sword strike, either cutting through the entire bone until reaching the membrane beneath the bone.
As an adze does in wood.
Therefore this type of fracture is called adze-like, or the sword may cut part of the bone and only scrape its surface without the cut penetrating to its end, and this type of fracture is called an absolute extraction, and the wound in these two fractures may be either large or small.
Among fractures is what occurs as crushing or bruising, its cause being a strike with a stone or falling on a stone or similar, and this fracture may either penetrate nearly reaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be on the surface of the bone.
The wound in these two fractures also may be either large or small. Among fractures is what occurs hidden in the bone as fine as a hair, and it is a slight crack.
Therefore this type of fracture is called capillary. Among them is a fracture occurring from a fall or strike of a stone or similar that pushes the surface of the bone inward and creates a depression in the area like what happens to a copper pot when struck so part of it goes inward.
This occurs most often in heads with soft bone like children's heads. All these types of fractures may have separated or unseparated fragments and we will come to mention the treatment of all that in its place. We recognize all these types of fractures by examining them.
And probing them with probes and removing corrupt flesh from them. As for the capillary type, it is recognized by exposing the bone and wiping it and smearing ink on it, for the fracture appears black. As for treating the fracture, first observe the patient's symptoms.
If you see among its symptoms what clearly indicates danger, such as bile vomiting, tension, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, protruding and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat them, for death is inevitable with these symptoms in most cases.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for their recovery, then proceed with treatment, such as when the wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded, and if this occurs during winter days.
You should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case, and if it is during summer days, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone becomes corrupted and those symptoms we described occur.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and is accompanied by fragmentation and crushing, you should cut the fragmented, crushed part as I will describe to you, which is to shave the head of the wounded patient.
Expose the bone in whatever way possible for you and according to the shape of the wound and what is tolerable for the patient. If you encounter bleeding or hot swelling when exposing the bone, treat it as necessary.
This means stuffing the area with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and clean the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding stops. Then proceed with hollowing out the bone and removing it, which can be done in one of two ways.
The first way is to cut the bone with a fine, narrow-bladed cutter, and this is its form:
Then use another cutter after this one that is slightly wider, and this is its form:
Then also use another cutter that is wider than the second one. You should have several different cutters, some wider than others and some shorter than others, with extremely sharp edges, made of Indian iron or good steel.
Be gentle when striking the cutter so as not to shake the head and harm it. If the bone is strong and hard, you should drill around it before using the cutters with what they call non-penetrating drills, and they are called non-penetrating drills.
Because they do not pass beyond the limit of the skull bone to what's behind it, as the drill has a circular edge below its sharp tip, similar to a collar or small circle that prevents it from penetrating and passing through the bone's thickness.
You should have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you have for each skull a drill whose sharp tip length corresponds to the thickness of that skull, and these are the forms of three types.
Of drills - large, medium, and small:
As for how to drill around the broken bone, place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated, then move the drill to another location and make the distance between each hole about the thickness of a probe or so.
Then cut between each pair of holes with the cutters, doing this with the utmost gentleness as we said, until you remove the bone either with your hand or with something else from the tools you have prepared for that.
Such as forceps and fine hooks, and you should be extremely careful not to let the drill or cutter touch any of the membrane. When you have hollowed out the bone and cleared it from the membrane if it was attached to it and removed it, you should strip.
And smooth the roughness remaining in the bone with another tool similar to the cutter, except it should be thinner and finer than the other cutters. If any small bones and splinters remain, remove them gently with the tools you have.
Then treat the wound afterward with wicks and ointments that will be mentioned. As for the other way of working, it is an absolutely easy way, far from risk, mentioned by Galen and greatly praised by him, and these are his words.
First you should begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and apparent, until when you have exposed that part, place under it the tip of this lenticular-shaped cutting tool, and this is its form:
The lenticular part of it should be smooth, not cutting anything, and its sharp part should be on its lengthwise sides as you see, so that the lenticular part rests against the membrane while the sharp cutting edge faces the bone, then strike the cutter from one side.
With a small hammer until you cut through the entire bone gently as it curves, while being safe from [harming] the membrane - no fearful incident will occur at all, even if the practitioner is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he were drowsy.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some places, scrape it away with the tip of the same lenticular cutting tool and separate it gently, for it will separate without harm or danger.
If the bone fracture has not penetrated to the membrane, and what is broken is the surface of the bone with roughness and fine splinters remaining, you should strip away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps, of which several different sizes should be prepared so you can use whichever is most suitable and appropriate in each location according to what the procedure and the nature and shape of the broken bone guides you to.
You should first use the widest of these rasps in scraping the bone, then use one finer than it, and continue doing this in succession until you get to using the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the remaining small hair-like cracks and fine fractures, you should use for each one a treatment according to what leads to its repair - something that is not hidden from one who has even minimal experience in this craft and has studied what we have written and explained about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, you should take a linen cloth sized to the wound, soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening, then take another cloth folded double or triple.
Soak it in wine and rose oil and place it over the first cloth, doing this as lightly as you can so as not to weigh down the membrane, then use a wide bandage over it and only tighten it enough to hold the wound closed.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from hot swelling, then unwrap it and afterwards use medicines that have extra dryness like iris roots, bitter vetch flour, frankincense powder, birthwort and similar items - that is, make these medicines into a powder.
Sprinkle on the wound while they are dry, and in general, use in this a medicine whose nature is to cleanse without stinging, and strive your utmost while treating the wound to keep it clean without oil residue or dirt, and never let pus accumulate in it.
For if pus accumulates on the brain membrane it will corrupt and rot it, causing great affliction for the patient, and blackness may appear on the surface of the head membrane when the bone is removed from it, especially if its treatment is neglected.
If you observe blackness on its surface and the symptoms we mentioned appear in the patient, know that they will perish inevitably, but if the blackness occurred from medicine placed on it and it was in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness.
Then you should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them well together, coat a cloth with them and place it on the membrane, then treat it with the types of treatment that are appropriate until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On setting the nose when it is broken.
Know that only the two upper parts of the nose break, either both or one of them, because they are bone, while the lower part is cartilage that does not break but rather suffers bruising, deviation, and flattening.
If one of its sides breaks, you should insert the little finger into the nostril and align that fracture from inside with your index finger and thumb from outside until you return the nose to its natural shape, and do this gently, taking care not to cause pain to the patient by your action.
If the break is in the upper nose and the finger cannot reach it, it should be aligned with the tip of a probe that has slight thickness, and if the break is on both sides, do the same, and hasten to set it on the first day of the break.
If possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling subsides, then insert into the nostril a wick made of linen cloth if the break is on one side, or insert two wicks if the break is on both sides.
Let the wicks be thick enough to fill the nostril, and some early bone-setters mentioned moistening the wicks with ghee and changing them daily, but I do not see this as proper; rather, the wicks should be moistened in egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the wicks until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens, and you may insert goose quill tubes in place of the wicks after wrapping them with soft cloth, which will hold the nose fracture more firmly and prevent the patient from being unable to breathe.
This is not essential - you may do it if you wish, or you may use the wicks, and if during your work hot swelling occurs, dress the nose with cerotum or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil or some diachylon ointment.
If no hot swelling occurs, you should dress it externally with semolina flour and frankincense powder kneaded with egg white, then place soft tow on it and do not bind the nose with anything at all, and if the nasal bones break into small pieces.
Or fragment, you should make an incision over them and remove them with the appropriate instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with healing and cicatrizing ointments suitable for that, and if a wound occurs inside the nose, you should treat it with wicks and use lead tubes.
Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On setting the lower jaw when it breaks.
If the lower jaw breaks and the break is not accompanied by a wound, examine it, and if the break is only external and has not broken into two and is concave inward, then recognizing it is easy.
If the break is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth, and likewise if the break is on the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand and gently raise the prominence of the break from inside to outside.
And your other hand from outside the bone controls its alignment, and if the jaw fracture has broken into two, traction should be applied from both sides in a straight line until alignment becomes possible, and if the teeth have become loose.
Or separated, tie those you hope will remain with gold, silver, or silk thread, then place cerotum on the broken jaw, then place a folded cloth on it, and place on the cloth a large, firm splint or a piece of shoe leather equal to the length of the jaw.
Then bind it from above as best you can bind it and as suits its compression until it does not come undone, and order the patient to rest and remain still, and make their food soft broths, and if you think something of the shape has changed in any way, hasten to unbind it on the third day.
Then fix what you dress it with mill dust mixed with egg white or with semolina flour after removing the cerotum from it and place soft tow on the dressing, and as long as that dressing stays attached to it and the bone's condition has not changed, leave it.
Don't remove it until the fracture heals and strengthens, for often this fracture strengthens in three weeks. If during that time hot swelling occurs, use what we have mentioned repeatedly to calm it until the swelling subsides.
As for if the fracture is with a wound, examine if a splinter or splinters have separated from the bone, then carefully extract those splinters with whatever tool is suitable. If the wound opening is narrow, widen it with a lancet according to your need.
Then when you have extracted those splinters and none remain, stitch the wound opening if it is wide, and if not, apply one of the ointments suitable for that.
And let the wound heal until it recovers.
Chapter Five.
On Setting the Collarbone When It Breaks.
The collarbone most often breaks at the front from the end of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it breaks and splits in two without creating splinters, which is the easiest to set.
Or splinters occur in the fracture, which is more difficult to set, or the fracture is with a wound. The procedure when the fracture is without a wound is to have two assistants present, one to hold the upper arm next to the broken collarbone and the other to stretch the neck toward the other side.
Then straighten the fracture with your fingers until its shape becomes as it should be, without protrusion or depression. If you need more extension, you should place a ball of rags or wool under the patient's armpit.
Its size should be according to your need, and extend and lift the collarbone and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is straightened as needed. If you cannot pull the end of the collarbone outward because it has gone deep, the patient should lie on their back.
Place a medium-sized pillow under their shoulder, and have the assistant press their shoulder downward until the collarbone bone that is deep rises upward, then fix the fracture and straighten it with your fingers.
If you feel that a splinter of the collarbone has broken off and become mobile, you should make an incision over it and carefully remove that splinter. If the splinter is trapped in the bone, work to cut it with one of the cutters you have prepared for that.
After placing under the collarbone the instrument that protects the membrane, which is an instrument of wood or iron, and this is its form:
It resembles a spoon without a depression, and its width should be according to what you need based on the bone's size, large or small, and as for its length, also according to what is possible for the procedure, and it should have two ends as you see, one end wider and the other narrower.
If the wound opening that you cut when removing the bone splinter is wide and you are not concerned about hot swelling, join the wound lips with stitching, and if the opening is small or you fear hot swelling, pack the wound with rags and pads according to the size of the incision.
If hot swelling occurs, moisten the rags in rose oil and vinegar or wine and apply it. As for binding the bone when there is no wound or incision, apply the poultice made from mill dust with egg white.
Place soft tow on it, then place the ball under their armpit if needed, then take a very long turban whose width is a span or thereabouts, then place a folded pad over the tow and poultice, then take a splint from a thin board.
Its width should be three fingers and likewise in length, then wrap it in a rag, then wrap that rag with the splint in the place of the turban that falls on the fracture site, then bind the turban on the fracture as it circles.
Wind it around their neck and under their healthy armpit and under their injured armpit, and return it multiple times in every direction and however you see that the binding secures the fracture firmly, which should be clear to you.
The main concern is that the splint should not move from the broken bone.
Therefore, you should check on the patient every day, and whenever the bandage becomes loose and you see that the splint has moved, fix this and tighten the bandage, then have the patient sleep on his back and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.
This is to raise his upper arm from his side, thus raising the collarbone fracture by elevating the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck, and do not loosen the bandage unless something occurs in the area like itching or swelling for twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see reason for that.
Return to tightening and leave it until the collarbone fracture heals and sets, and it typically strengthens and fortifies mostly in twenty-eight days.
And in some people it may be less than that.
Chapter Six.
On Setting Shoulder Fractures. The shoulder rarely breaks in its broad part but rather breaks at its edges, so whenever a location breaks or it breaks in its middle, this is known by touch, so according to the shape of the fracture, proceed.
Straighten it and return it to its natural shape by whatever means possible, then apply mill dust with egg white and soft oakum, and place above it a folded cloth pad, then place on it a wide splint made of thin board.
[The board should be] thin according to the size of the entire shoulder or slightly wider than it, and if there is any unevenness under the splint in any area of the shoulder, level that unevenness with soft oakum until the splint lies evenly, then bind it firmly from above with a long turban.
Bind it firmly and secure the splint so it doesn't move from its position, and check the bandage every day, whenever the bandage loosens tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved from its position, and the patient should lie on their healthy side, and the shoulder heals in twenty.
Days or twenty-five days, and when this period is complete, loosen the bandage while you are safe as it is among the bones that one does not fear will shatter or break again, and if a splinter of bone protrudes and is pricking under the skin, make an incision over it and remove it.
And do what I mentioned in treating the collarbone fracture regarding calming hot swelling if anything like that occurs.
Chapter Seven.
On Setting Chest Fractures.
The chest may break in its middle though this rarely occurs, while its edges break and fragment more frequently, and among its symptoms when its middle breaks is that it sinks downward and causes severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing.
Sometimes blood may be expelled and the depression in the broken bone becomes apparent and is not hidden to the senses, and to set it, have the patient lie on their back with a pillow between their shoulder blades, then press down on their shoulders and gather the ribs with hands from both sides and carefully straighten it in whatever way possible.
And continue until the shape of the bone returns to what it should be, then apply the dressing and oakum and place above it a splint of thin board made of willow or maple or similar light wood after wrapping it in cloth.
Then carefully bind it to the broken bone so it doesn't move, and pass the bandage around in circles to the back multiple times and tie it firmly, then check the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.
And if necessity calls for loosening it due to erosion occurring in the area or pain or swelling, then hasten to loosen it and remove the dressing and fix whatever has occurred through its proper treatment method then return the dressing if you see fit for that.
Place it and maintain the bandaging until it heals.
Chapter Eight.
On setting broken ribs: Know that breaks in the ribs typically occur in the thick areas near the back, while their front ends usually suffer bruising because they are cartilaginous. This condition is not difficult to diagnose through examination with the fingers.
To set them, straighten the break with the fingers in the most feasible way until the shape is properly aligned, then dress and bind the broken bone with a splint if needed. If the broken ribs are bent inward, the patient will experience severe pain.
And a pricking sensation like that which occurs to one with pleurisy, because the bone pricks the diaphragm, and the patient also experiences difficulty breathing, coughing, and significant blood discharge. This is difficult to treat, and the ancients have attempted many solutions for it.
Some say the patient's diet should include foods that generate bloating and wind so that the stomach expands and pushes the break outward. We dislike this approach lest it confirm the occurrence of inflammation if it hasn't already occurred, and if it has occurred, it will increase and reinforce it.
Others say to place a cupping glass over the area and apply strong suction, which seems more logical, except there is fear that the cup might draw waste matter to the weakened area. Some say the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
Place padding between the ribs until filled so the bandage will be even when wrapped around. Then treat the patient for pleurisy with food and medicine. If the patient is overwhelmed by severe discomfort that cannot be endured.
And if the bone is pricking the diaphragm harmfully and we fear for the patient, we should make an incision over the area and expose the broken rib, then place beneath it the instrument that protects the membrane as previously described, carefully cut the bone and remove it.
Then join the wound edges if it is large with stitches and treat it with ointments until it heals. If inflammation occurs during this process, hurry to moisten dressings with rose oil and place them on the area, and treat the patient internally with what calms inflammation.
Have them lie on whichever side allows them to sleep more comfortably until they heal.
Chapter Nine.
On Setting Vertebrae of the Back and Neck.
As for the neck bones, they rarely suffer breaks and more commonly experience bruising, as do the vertebrae of the back. If this happens to someone and you want to know if they will recover or not.
Observe if you see their hands have become flaccid, numb and lifeless, unable to move, extend or contract, and if when pinched or pricked with a needle they neither feel it nor experience pain, know that in most cases they will not recover and are doomed.
If they can move them and feel pinching and pricking, know that the bone marrow is safe and the patient will recover with treatment. If the same happens to the vertebrae of the back and you want to know if they will also recover or not.
Look at their legs, and if you see they have become flaccid and experienced what happened to the hands, then if they lie on their back wind and stool exit without control, and if they lie on their stomach urine exits without control.
And if they lie on their back and want to urinate, they cannot do so, know that they are doomed, so do not trouble yourself with treating them. If none of this occurs, the situation is less severe. The treatment for what has occurred is to attempt to calm the inflammation.
By placing rose oil alone or with roasted egg whites on the bruised vertebra, applying this three times during the day until the inflammation subsides, then apply one of the strengthening, drying dressings to the area, bind it with bandages, and order them to rest and remain still.
Let them not sleep except on the side where they don't feel pain until they heal. If during the injury a splinter has occurred in the bone or something has separated from it, then you should cut open the skin and remove that bone.
Then join the wound lips if it is large by stitching, then treat with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx breaks, which is the tail end, you should insert the thumb of the left hand into the rectum.
And straighten the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible and accomplish the straightening, then apply the bandage and splint if needed, then tie it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, cut over it and remove it, and treat the wound with the previously mentioned treatment until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On Setting Hip Fractures.
Hip bones rarely break, but if they do break, their fracture happens by splintering at their ends and splitting lengthwise and tilting inward, and the patient experiences pain in the area and pricking sensations and numbness in the leg on the side of the fracture.
To set it, pass your hand over it until you determine how the fracture is shaped. If the fracture is only at its ends, then straighten that fracture as much as you can manage until its shape resembles the natural form.
If the fracture is lengthwise or has tilted inward, lay the patient on their stomach until you can set that fracture. When you have straightened it, apply the bandage then place on it a splint of wood or leather and tie it firmly.
Do not fear the fracture moving or the splint shifting, and fill the hollow of the flanks with something until the binding takes evenly, and order the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side. If hot swelling occurs.
Then stop stretching and setting it until the hot swelling subsides and apply what will calm it as previously mentioned, then return to setting and binding it as necessary. If splinters occur in the bone or something breaks off from its ends, it should not be removed.
Nor should it be touched, but rather straightened from the outside as we said and leave its binding until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On Setting Humeral Fractures.
The humerus is what lies between the elbow and the head of the shoulder. If it breaks, its setting is done in one of two ways: first, take a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness like this shape:
And tie two bindings at its ends, then hang it from an elevated place and have the patient sit on a chair, then place their broken arm over the stick until their armpit is pressed against the middle of the stick's curve, then hang something heavy from above.
Or have an assistant pull it downward while the physician straightens the fracture with both hands until the fracture is properly reduced. The other method is to have the patient lie on their back and hang their hand from their neck with a binding.
Then order two assistants, one to hold above the fracture with their hands and the other to hold below it, and each one pulls toward their side. If you want the pulling to be stronger, tie a binding below the fracture and another above it, and have each assistant pull them toward their respective sides.
If the fracture is close to the shoulder tip, you should place [the middle of] the binding under the armpit and the other below the fracture toward the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, you should place the binding on that spot and on the elbow itself.
Then straighten the fracture gently without force until when the fracture is properly aligned and well-joined, then bind it if there is no hot swelling. If hot swelling occurs, leave its binding until the seventh day and place on it wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until when the swelling subsides, then bind it. The method of binding it is to apply the dressing on the fracture, then apply a bandage of new cloth over the dressing, then bring the forearm to the humerus itself and place their hand open on their shoulder.
Bandages and bindings should be applied to the upper arm and forearm so that the forearm acts as a splint if nothing prevents you from doing so and if nothing has changed in the broken bone. If you fear that something might change, then use splints.
You should place on the break itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints, and there should be a finger's width between each splint, and the length of the splints should be according to the break with an addition of three fingers from each side.
Then bind the splints with the binding that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Your binding should be tightest at the site of the break.
And the further from the break, the less tight the binding should be. If you see fit to place the splints and binding as we said immediately when setting the limb, then do so.
If you fear hot swelling, leave off the binding and splints until the seventh day as we said, then check the bandage every three days lest there occur in the area itching or swelling or the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness, so fix all of that as we mentioned.
If you are confident that none of this will occur, then do not loosen the bandage except after many days, and the patient should lie on his back with his hand on his stomach, and a pillow filled with wool should be placed under the upper arm at a moderate height.
Check at all times, day or night, lest the shape of the broken limb become displaced or the bandage become loose, so fix all of that with your effort, and make the patient's nourishment according to the level we previously prescribed, that the nourishment should be light at first until the bone begins to harden.
Then you should thicken his nourishment, for it is the custom of the upper arm and leg to harden in forty days, at which time you should loosen it and use the bath and treat with ointments that are suitable for that. If the break is severe and crushed,
Then do not loosen the bandage until fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve
On Setting Broken Forearms
The forearm is composed of two bones called the two zands (radius and ulna): one small, which is next to the thumb, and the other large, which is positioned below the small one from below. Sometimes the larger zand breaks alone or the smaller one alone, and sometimes they break together.
When the small upper zand breaks, its setting is easy and its healing is faster, and when the lower zand breaks, its break is worse and its healing is difficult, and worst of all is when both bones break together. If the bone that is broken is the small upper zand,
The physician should, when setting it, make its extension slight and gentle until he aligns it, and if it is the large zand that is broken, he should make its extension stronger, and if both zands are broken, he should make the extension very strong indeed.
The hand should be positioned when setting and extending it stretched out on a pillow, with the thumb of the hand higher than all the fingers and the little finger lower than the rest of the fingers, and the patient sitting cross-legged.
The pillow should be at his level in height so the patient does not endure hardship.
Then an assistant should extend the forearm from below either with his hand or with a bandage, and another assistant should extend from above likewise, then the physician should align the bone until he returns it to the best shape possible. If there are splinters in the broken bone, try
To return each splinter to its place with your best effort, and if a separate splinter appears that is pricking the skin and you have no hope of setting it, then cut into it and extract it in the manner we described previously. If the break is with a wound, I have devoted a chapter to it.
So take the treatment of that from there. If at the beginning of your setting a hot swelling occurs, then smear a cloth with cerotum made with rose oil and white wax, and let it be moderate between thick and thin, and bind the cloths on it with a gentle binding until the swelling subsides.
Remove the wax dressing and apply the poultice prepared from mill dust mixed with egg white, then apply the splints. The splint placed directly on the fracture should be slightly wider and stronger, and know that the number of splints for the forearm is typically six.
Whether the fracture is in one or both forearm bones, make your binding stronger and tighter at the fracture site, and as you wrap above or below, make the binding slightly looser as mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
The bandages wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist cloths, not too rigid, and the binding thread should specifically be made of cotton, medium between thin and thick as we described. Check the limb and bandage after several days.
If something occurs that needs correction, such as itching in the limb, the limb should be washed with warm water until the itching subsides, and leave the limb unbound for a night to rest, then resume binding.
If the binding has loosened and the bone has shifted or similar issues, correct all of this to the best of your ability. Also observe if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive binding, in which case you should loosen it slightly and leave it for days until nourishment flows to it, then bind it again.
If none of what we mentioned happens to the patient, it should not be unwrapped except after twenty days or so. Then hang the patient's hand from their neck, keeping the forearm moderate, and they should be careful to avoid disturbing movements and sleep on their back.
Know that this forearm fracture heals in thirty days or thirty-two days, and sometimes heals in twenty-eight days, all according to the conditions of temperaments and strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On Setting Fractures of the Palm and Fingers.
The metacarpals and finger phalanges rarely experience fracture, but rather commonly experience crushing. When the palm experiences fracture or crushing.
The patient should sit cross-legged with a level chair in front of them.
Then place their hand extended upon it, then an assistant extends the broken bones and the physician aligns them until when they are well-aligned, then the dressing and oakum should be applied if there is no hot swelling, then apply a splint from above according to the size of the area.
Having wrapped it in a soft cloth, if the fracture is downward toward the palm's interior, make a ball-like shape from cloth and order the patient to grasp it with their broken palm, then bind it with a long cloth.
The splint should be made of leather with some flexibility so the skin adheres with the bending of the entire palm, and bind it as necessary. If the fracture is outward, you should place the splint from above and another splint below in the palm so the hand remains open and upright.
Then apply the binding as the hand turns and interlace between the fingers with the bandage. If the fracture occurs in one of the finger phalanges, if it is the thumb, align it as necessary then bind it with the palm, and if you wish, make for it a small upright splint to keep the fracture.
And not moving. If the fracture is in the other fingers like the middle finger, index finger, little finger, or ring finger, align it and bind it with the adjacent healthy finger or bind them all in sequence which is better, or place upon them a small upright splint.
As we said regarding the thumb, and check during your setting and afterward for hot swelling, and address it as necessary whenever something of that occurs, as has been repeatedly described.
Chapter Fourteen.
On Setting a Broken Thigh.
The thigh bone frequently breaks and is perceptible to the senses because it shifts forward and backward, and setting it is done by tying one bandage above the break and another bandage below the break, with the patient lying face down.
Then an assistant pulls each bandage in its direction evenly - this is if the break is in the middle of the bone. But if it is close to the base of the thigh, you should tie a soft bandage, either of wool or similar material.
Near the base of the thigh towards the pubic area so the pulling occurs upward, and the other bandage below the break, and likewise if the break is near the knee, the bandage should be near the knee so the pulling occurs downward. Then the physician aligns the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural form.
The bone should join together well, and at that point the dressing and binding should be applied if no hot swelling occurs in the limb. If swelling occurs, leave it for days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to treating it.
As for binding it, you should wrap a firm, wide turban around the break two or three times with some excess remaining. Then bend the leg until the heel is near the buttocks, and insert a long thread between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, making the ends of the thread come out above from both sides.
Then wrap the excess of the turban around the leg and thigh, then place splints on the thigh at the break site itself, and place one splint on the leg bone, then fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft rags so the binding is even.
Then begin with strong binding from the middle at the break site with three or four turns, and as you move away from the break site with the bandage, make your binding progressively lighter, softer, and looser.
Then take the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg and tie them to the nearby upper splints, then pass the thread ends downward until you reach the heel tendon, and with them also tie the ends of the splints from the other side.
So that the bandage doesn't move from its place, then leave the binding as long as no erosion, swelling, or inflammation occurs in the limb and such. If any of this occurs, hasten to loosen it and fix whatever has occurred according to what we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a bone splinter that pricks, you should align it if possible; if not, then cut down to it and extract it, and treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals. This thigh fracture can also be bound without attaching the leg to it with splints.
As we mentioned for the upper arm and forearm, except that setting it this way doesn't cause the patient to limp, while if you set it alone without joining it to the leg, the patient will inevitably limp forever.
Know that the thigh strengthens in fifty days, give or take a little, all depending on the variation in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On Breaking of the Kneecap.
The kneecap rarely breaks but is often bruised, and if it does break, it's either a split or fragmentation of its parts, and this can occur with or without a wound.
You can determine all of this by examination, and setting it is done by aligning the separated parts with the fingers until they come together and join as much as possible with gentleness and precision, then apply the dressing and place a rounded splint on it if needed.
Then bind it from above with appropriate binding, then monitor all the conditions we described in other fractures, such as hot swelling and such, by treating each symptom with what suits it until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On Setting Leg Fractures.
The leg has two bones, one thick which is called the leg bone, and the other thin which is called the fibula, and they are subject to the same types of fractures that occur in the two bones of the forearm.
Therefore, setting it is like setting the forearm exactly and the procedure is the same; if both bones break, the leg turns in all directions, and if the thinner bone breaks, the leg turns forward, and if the thicker bone breaks, especially from below, this will not be hidden from you.
Apply extension and alignment and bind the splints accordingly, except that if the leg fracture is severe with many fragments, the extension should be lesser and gentler, and you should be as careful as possible in setting it.
For the leg, there is an additional procedure beyond that of the forearm, which is that after you have aligned the splints and completed all your work, take two wooden strips made of pine that are used in flattening rooms which are placed between cracks in boards, or they can be from palm fronds or similar material.
Choose ones that are slightly thick and not from the thin ones, and let their length be the length of the leg from the knee downward, then wrap each one with cloth twice along its length and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side.
Let them extend from the knee to below the foot, then tie the strips in three places at both ends and the middle, for with this restraint the leg is prevented from leaning right and left and is properly aligned, and a wooden trough can be used along the length of the leg.
It is placed in it to prevent movement, and this should especially be done in fractures when there is also a wound, then examine the leg every day and pay careful attention to swelling or inflammation or anything else of that nature.
When any of these occurs, treat it as necessary until it heals, and the leg bone heals in thirty days or thereabouts.
Chapter Seventeen.
On Fractures of the Foot Bones and Toes.
As for the ankle, it never experiences fracture, but the foot bones can experience fracture, and the toes also rarely experience fracture but rather usually experience crushing.
If the foot bones experience fracture and you see those bones protruding over each other, have the patient place their foot upright on the ground as if walking, then stand and place your foot on what has risen of those bones and press down and align them.
Until they return to their positions, then apply the dressing and lint from above and place under the sole of the foot a small board that has two flat ends, then bind the foot firmly after wrapping it with cloths and whatever else you need.
When three or four days have passed, loosen the binding and you will find the bones aligned whether they were broken or dislocated, so the procedure is as you see, and if some toes break, set them and align them according to what I described to you for setting fingers.
Then make for the broken toe a splint along the length of the toe and let it be slightly wider than it, then place under the foot this board which I described to you and bind it firmly, and if what is broken of the bones is two or three or more.
Make for each toe a splint of its size wrapped in soft cloth and bind the board to the bottom of the foot, and let each end of the two ends of the board extend beyond the sole of the foot to secure it properly.
You should not forget to monitor everything we mentioned to you regarding all fractures for the symptoms we discussed and treat each symptom as necessary.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of a woman's vulva, pubic bone, and a man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, seat her cross-legged, then bend her gradually backward, and have her be held from behind. Then the midwife should stuff her vulva with cotton until it fills it and becomes like a ball in her vulva.
Then shake the woman and raise her back gradually, for that cotton will come out until it becomes like a ball at the entrance of the vulva and the bone fracture returns [to place]. Then place a compress on her back, and when she needs to urinate, remove the cotton gently so she can urinate.
Return it as it was first inserted, then return to her first compress. Do this for seven days or so and it will heal. If you wish, you can take a sheep's bladder, tie a reed tube to its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her vulva.
Then blow forcefully into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, for the fracture will return [to place]. Then stuff it with cotton and maintain this for days as we described until it heals. As for when the pubic bone is fractured in a man or woman, use in its setting...
And the correct approach to these unusual fractures that rarely occur should not be unclear to you, especially for one who has some experience and understands this book of mine well, because the fracture itself will guide you in most cases...
As for a man's penis when it is fractured, take a goose's windpipe and insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth over it and bind it and leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen
On Setting Bone Fractures When Accompanied by a Wound
For one who has suffered a fracture with a wound, especially if it is a large bone like the thigh or upper arm or similar, you should hasten to bleed them immediately if the conditions for bloodletting that we previously mentioned are met.
If the wound is bleeding, you should hasten to stop it by sprinkling ground vitriol on it if nothing else is available, then proceed with setting the fracture on that same day and do not delay it.
If no hot swelling occurs. But if hot swelling occurs, leave its setting until the ninth day until the hot swelling subsides, and do not approach it on the third and fourth day at all, for it will cause bad symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin and exposed, you should attempt to return it and align it with your hands gently and with slight traction. If you cannot return and align it with your hands, return it with this instrument, which is made of iron and is about seven or eight fingers long.
And its width according to the size of the wound.
Therefore, the physician should have three or four of these, according to what is needed for treatment in each type of fracture, and they should be rounded with some thickness so they don't bend when pressed during the procedure.
And it should be sharp at the tip with a curve at its end, and its upper part should be thicker while from its middle to bottom much thinner, and this is its form:
It is called in Greek "pirim" meaning small lever. You should place its sharp, curved tip on the protruding bone end and push it with it at once until when the bone returns and aligns somewhat, then attempt to align the fracture ends with each other.
If its broken end is thin and the instrument cannot grip it well, you should cut the end of that bone until the instrument can grip it. If you cannot return the bone at all with what we described, cut it with whatever suitable cutting instruments we mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws however possible for you, then strip away what remains of roughness and thin scales in the bone. If after you return the bone the patient feels severe, harmful pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can return it to its natural position, do so for you will benefit the patient greatly. When you complete setting the bone, dip a cloth in astringent black wine, especially if you are in summer, and do not put on the wound any cerates or anything containing oil.
So that no rot or corruption occurs in it, then use splints when you finish setting the bone and leave the wound exposed by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors according to the size of the wound.
Be extremely cautious not to bind the wound with the fracture, as ignorant physicians have often done this and caused their patients either death, gangrene, or inflammation. Your binding should be soft and loose, different from the binding of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or large and you fear some of the dangerous symptoms we described, and there is disturbing pain in the area, you should not put splints on it but make bandages from strong cloth in place of splints and bind it with these.
After a day or two, when you see pus beginning to form in the wound, remove the cloth that was placed on it with wine, then use wicks and ointments that we customarily use to treat wounds, like the quadruple ointment and similar ones, and you should loosen the bandage.
Check the wound twice daily, morning and evening, until it heals and recovers, and you should position the limb in a way that allows pus to drain downward easily. If many days pass and the wound doesn't heal and the pus doesn't stop, know that there are small bone fragments there.
You should probe the wound with a probe, and whatever fragments are loose, extract and remove them. Those that are not loose and are pricking the limb causing pain, attempt to cut and extract them by whatever means possible.
If the wound develops inflammation, gangrene, or another type of corruption and rot, you should treat each symptom with the corresponding treatment that was previously described in its chapter.
One thing you must note and keep in mind is that if a large bone breaks and protrudes from the limb, like the thighbone or upper arm bone or similar large members, do not attempt to pull or extract it.
Often death results from this, rather leave it until it rots, as it might fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
At that point, treat the wound if you see a possibility for treatment, otherwise leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
On treating the knot that occurs following some fractures.
This knot often occurs following the healing of fractures, especially near joints, making the limb's appearance ugly and sometimes preventing its natural function.
Look - if the knot is fresh, use astringent medicines like aloe, frankincense, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia and similar substances, taking some or all of these and kneading them with astringent wine or egg white or vinegar.
Apply this to the knot with hemp fiber and bind it well, leaving the binding undisturbed for many days, then unbind it and repeat with another until the knot disappears, God willing, or bind a sheet of lead firmly over it.
For lead has a special property that removes all protrusions in the limbs. If the knot has hardened and strengthened, and necessity compels its removal, cut into it from above and cut away the protruding excess or scrape it with some scrapers until it's gone, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On treating a fracture when it has healed but the limb remains thereafter thin, contrary to its original nature.
When bone fractures heal and the limb remains thin and weak afterward, this happens for many reasons.
Among them are either frequent loosening and improper rebinding of bandages, or excessive tightness of bandages preventing nourishment from flowing to the limb, or excessive fomentation, or inappropriate movements at the wrong time, or lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich their body until blood increases in it, and use the bath, bring them happiness and joy and such things, then apply pitch to the limb so the pitch draws much nourishment to it, or continue fomentation with lukewarm water.
Until the nourishment flows in it and it returns to its natural shape.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On treating broken bones when they have healed crooked and prevented their proper function.
When a limb that has healed after recovery becomes crooked, or the broken bone protrudes, or becomes knotted, and the appearance of the limb becomes ugly because of this.
However, if the limb is not prevented from its natural function, you should not accept the claim of one who suggests breaking the limb anew, though many ignorant physicians and bone-setters in our country used to do this.
This practice is very reprehensible and leads to great risk, the least of which is damage, but if the crookedness and knotting is fresh, it should be treated with water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as marshmallow leaves and its root, melilot, and the like.
It should be bandaged with softening dressings like well-made diachylon, or take marshmallow root mucilage and mix it with chicken fat and sesame oil and bandage with it, or take fatty figs and pound them with pigeon droppings and similar medicines that are called scar-breaking.
The knotting may dissolve with continuous gentle massage done by hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all times. If the crookedness is old and has become severe and hardened, and necessity calls for treating it with iron.
Then you should cut above it and release the bone's connection and cut away the excess knotting or bone with fine cutters, and do this with utmost gentleness and care, then treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On the Discussion of Dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its position, which hinders movement, disfigures the shape of the limb, and causes the patient severe pains and aches. When someone suffers a dislocation, it should be reduced immediately.
Do not delay it at all, for if delayed, the area will swell making it difficult to reduce the dislocation, therefore it should neither be delayed nor moved nor stretched while swollen because it often causes spasms and harmful pains to the patient.
But if this occurs, one should hasten to bleed the patient, then leave it until the swelling subsides a little, then bathe the limb with hot water and oil, then reduce it gently and treat each limb as will be mentioned in its place.
I have arranged the chapters on dislocation also according to what preceded in fractures from the top of the body to its bottom.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On treating dislocation of the lower jaw.
The jaws rarely dislocate except in rare cases, and their dislocation occurs in two ways: either they shift slightly from their positions and become somewhat loose, or they dislocate completely and fully until they loosen.
Towards the chest until the patient's saliva flows and they cannot contain it nor can they close their jaw, and their tongue stumbles in speech. As for if the dislocation is slight, it usually returns on its own with minimal intervention.
But if the dislocation is complete and full, you should hasten to reduce it quickly and not delay it at all. An assistant should hold the patient's head and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the mouth if the dislocation is on one side.
Or insert both thumbs if the dislocation is on both sides, with the rest of the fingers outside to align it, and order the patient to relax their jaw and allow it to move in any direction while the physician aligns the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its position.
If it is difficult to reduce, especially if both jaws are involved, use hot water and oil fomentation until they are easy to reduce, and do not delay their reduction at all as we said. When they return and align and the patient's mouth closes and they do not loosen, then place cloth pads with a ceratum made of wax and rose oil on them.
Then bind it gently with a loose bandage, and have the patient sleep on his back with his head stabilized between two pillows so he doesn't move it right or left, and he shouldn't attempt to chew anything but rather take his nourishment as soft gruel.
Until when the pain subsides and the jaw sets, then he may eat whatever he wishes, but he should do so gently and not force his mouth open when eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw sets and heals.
If it becomes difficult to reduce the jaws when they are dislocated at some point and do not return to their positions, this often results in fevers and persistent headache, and sometimes the patient's bowels become loose, and sometimes he vomits pure bile, so when you see this, know that it is fatal.
And many who experience this die within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On Reducing Dislocation of the Clavicle and Shoulder Tip.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inner side due to its connection to the chest, but it may dislocate outward and this is perceptible to the touch, and its reduction requires the patient to lie on his back and extend his arms.
Then press the area firmly with your palm and it will return, then apply the dressing and pads and bind them, and as for its end which joins the shoulder and connects to it, it rarely dislocates, but if it should dislocate one day, it should be reduced and aligned as we mentioned and as is possible for you.
Then apply the dressing, pads, and binding, and order the patient to maintain rest and stillness until he recovers, and with this very same treatment you reduce the shoulder tip when it also moves from its position.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On Reducing Shoulder Dislocation.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one is that it dislocates downward toward the armpit, the second is that it dislocates toward the chest, and sometimes it dislocates upward above the shoulder, though this is rare.
It does not dislocate backward due to the scapula, nor forward due to the nerves, and most commonly it dislocates and comes out downward toward the armpit, especially in those with little flesh because in them it comes out quickly and goes back in quickly.
As for those with much flesh, it is the opposite, meaning it comes out with difficulty and goes back in with difficulty, and sometimes some people suffer a blow or fall causing the shoulder to swell with hot swelling, so it is thought to be dislocated, thus you should examine this until you ascertain its truth.
Then proceed with its treatment, and the dislocation is recognized when it is downward toward the armpit by comparing between the dislocated shoulder and the healthy shoulder, for you will find an obvious difference between them and find a depression in the shoulder head, and under the armpit upon palpation the shoulder head feels like an egg.
The patient cannot raise his hand to his ear nor move it in all directions, and likewise if it dislocates toward the chest or upward, you will find this obvious to touch and not hidden.
And this dislocation may be easy to reduce when it is recent or when the patient is a youth, and its reduction requires an assistant to raise his hand upward, then you place your thumbs under his armpit and forcefully lift the joint upward to its position while the assistant raises his hand and extends it upward.
Then he lowers it downward and it will return quickly, but if it does not return by what we mentioned and the dislocation has been present for many days, the patient should bathe in hot water and use an emollient and softening fomentation such as cooking marshmallow root, fenugreek, and melilot in water and applying it.
Then have the patient lie on his back and place under his armpit a wool ball of moderate firmness between soft and hard, then the physician places his heel on the ball and holds the patient's hand with his hand and pulls it downward.
And pushes the ball with his foot so it will return immediately, and if you wish you may reduce it in this way: bring a man taller than the patient and position him at the side and have him insert his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raise his armpit upward until the patient is suspended in the air.
Another assistant pulls the patient's hand down toward their belly, and if the patient is light in weight, something else should be attached to weigh them down, as the dislocation will be reduced immediately, and it can also be reduced in another way.
A long wooden post should be fixed in the ground with a rounded head like a mortar pestle, neither too thick nor too thin, then placed under the patient's armpit after putting soft rags on the post's head, with the patient standing along the length of the post.
Then their hand is pulled downward from the other side and their body is also pulled strongly from the other direction, so the joint quickly returns to its place. If reduction is difficult with all we mentioned, then use this treatment: take a wooden piece about two cubits long.
Its width should be about four fingers and its thickness about two fingers, with a rounded head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the armpit, as shown in this illustration:
Then tie soft rags on the rounded head so the wood doesn't harm the patient, then place it under the armpit and extend the entire hand and arm down along the wood, and tie the wood to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then place the arm across a ladder rung and pull the hand downward, leaving the rest of the body hanging from the other side, and the joint will reduce immediately. When reduction is complete by whatever means possible, a moderately-sized wool ball should be placed under the armpit.
Then apply the dressing prepared from mill dust with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder as it curves from above, then firmly bind the ball under the armpit and wrap the bandage over the dressing from above, and suspend the hand from their neck.
The patient should not move their hand for seven days, and their food should be reduced until the limb strengthens, as this speeds recovery. Then untie after seven or five days and exercise with movement - if it remains stable without loosening, it has healed.
If the joint dislocates frequently due to moisture affecting it or another cause, then cauterization should be performed with three skewers as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization. If you do all this and remove the bandage after seven days and the joint doesn't stay in place.
And you repeat the dressing and binding multiple times but it doesn't stay and falls and becomes lax and you cannot raise it upward, know that its nerve at the head of the shoulder has either torn, stretched, or become lax, and know then that the joint will never stay in place.
As for the dislocation toward the chest and breast and backward, its reduction is done by pushing and pulling with hands until it returns, and all binding and treatment is used until it heals. If after healing there is stiffness in the limb and slowness in movement.
The patient should use the bath many times until that stiffness softens and returns to its natural state.
Chapter Twenty-Seven
On the Treatment of Elbow Dislocation
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty, and it can dislocate in all directions, especially forward or backward, and its dislocation is not hidden from you as it is visible and palpable in whatever form it dislocates.
When you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, this becomes clearly evident to you by the joint's concavity, and the patient cannot bend the arm or touch their shoulder with it. You should hurry to reduce the dislocation immediately before hot swelling occurs.
For if hot swelling occurs, reduction becomes difficult and sometimes might not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backward, as it is the worst of all types of dislocations, the most painful, and often death descends with it.
Its reduction, when possible to return, requires an assistant to pull their hand with both hands while the arm is extended, and the physician's hands above and below the elbow while pushing the joint with both thumbs or the base of their palm until it returns to its place.
If the dislocation is forward, it can be reduced by suddenly bending the arm until the base of its palm strikes the shoulder that faces it. If the dislocation does not respond to reduction, then employ very strong and forceful traction, such that two assistants pull the arm.
Two assistants should also hold the patient lest he move during the traction. Then rotate the arm in all directions after wrapping his hand with a folded cloth or wide bandage. When the physician manipulates the joint with his hands, he should anoint them with oil to help the joint slide back easily.
Then push the joint forcefully until it returns. After its return, it is necessary to apply a dressing that contains astringents and drying agents along with egg white, bind it firmly, suspend the arm from the patient's neck, and leave it for days.
Then unbind it. If the joint has stabilized in its place, remove the binding and leave it. If you see the joint has not fully strengthened, reapply the dressing and binding and leave it again for days until it strengthens, then unbind it. If stiffness occurs after the joint's return and unbinding,
And movement becomes difficult, then moistening treatments should be used in the bath, along with gentle massage and kneading until it softens, or place the fat tail of a fat ram on the joint, then bind it and leave it for a day and night, then remove it and have him enter the bath. When he sweats, rub the joint moderately.
Then reapply the fat tail a second and third time with bath entry until it softens. If you wish to apply fresh cow dung mixed with fat and bind it on, do this repeatedly as it will soften and return to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight
On the Treatment of Wrist Dislocation
The wrist frequently dislocates, and reducing its dislocation is easier than other joints, but it is necessary to hasten its reduction in the hour it dislocates, before the area swells or hot swelling occurs.
To reduce its dislocation, place the patient's wrist on a board, have an assistant extend his hand, and the physician places his palm on the joint's prominence and pushes until it returns. However, it is necessary to observe if the dislocation has moved to the palm of the hand.
Then the patient should place the back of his hand on the board during extension and reduction. If the dislocation protrudes to the back of the hand, then the palm should be placed on the board so the physician's hand falls directly on the joint's prominence. If it returns immediately, fine; if not, bind it with a dressing that prevents swelling.
Leave it and do not attempt again as it cannot bear it, and you cannot reduce it after days have passed, though the joint will remain crooked without harming the patient unless the hand becomes flaccid and cannot grasp anything.
At that point, know that the nerve is severed or crushed, and there is no solution except cauterization, which may or may not help. When the wrist reduction is complete, apply the dressing we described, then bind it and leave it for five days.
Then unbind it and exercise the hand. If its movement becomes difficult and some stiffness occurs, soften it with heated water and rubbing repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter Twenty-Nine
On the Treatment of Finger Dislocations
Fingers can dislocate in any direction. When a finger dislocates toward the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns, then bind the fingertip and suspend it toward the direction it was dislocated to.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it stands straight that day. At night, bind it according to the same description. Continue to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night. Do this for days until it strengthens.
Do likewise if it dislocates toward the palm of the hand - bind it toward the same direction and treat it as you did the first time until it heals. Do the same whenever it dislocates in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
On treating dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation occurs in one of the vertebrae of the back or neck, or when many vertebrae move from their positions, there is no treatment for it because death comes quickly to the patient.
And the sign of this is that the patient's stool comes out involuntarily without being able to control it, and often some of their limbs become paralyzed, either their legs, their arms, or one of them. But if a single vertebra moves from its position, it can often be restored.
Its displacement can be in four directions, and that which moves backward is called a hump. As for its treatment, you should observe - if the hump has occurred since childhood, there is no treatment for it and no cure whatsoever. As for that which occurred due to a fall or a blow or similar.
The ancients have mentioned various types of treatments with lengthy discourse, most of which is not useful, and I have summarized from that what little suffices instead of their many words, based on my experience with the matter and my explanation of it, and I have illustrated the instrument differently from what they showed and explained.
I say that the hump which occurs in the front of the chest has no solution and no cure, and likewise those to both sides also. Only that which occurs in the back specifically can be treated with what I am about to describe, which is that you lay the patient on his face.
On a level bench near a wall, and spread beneath him soft padding so his chest isn't hurt, then place an upright wooden post planted in a hole in the ground at the end of the bench near his head, and another post near his feet at the other end of the bench.
And an assistant holds the post, which should not be fixed in the hole, and another assistant holds the other one in the same way, then wrap around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft, secure bandage and extend the end of the bandage to the post at his head and tie it there.
Then secure with another bandage above his hips and above his knees and at his heel tendons, then gather all the bandages together and tie them to the other post which is at his feet, then each assistant pulls his post with the bandage in his direction, and the two posts do not move from their positions they are planted in.
Except that they are not fixed as we said, and the physician places his palms on the vertebra forcefully until it returns, or places a board on it then leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board about three cubits in length.
And dig in the wall which we said should be near the patient a place to insert the end of the board, then place the middle of the board on the hump and the physician places his feet on the other end and presses down firmly until he compresses the vertebra.
And it returns to its place. And if you wish to do it with the screw that is turned by hand, which is that you plant in the ground at the patient's head at the end of the bench two wooden posts one cubit in length, and at his feet at the end of the bench also two posts.
And let the distance between each post be a span, and make in each post a hole through which the screw runs, and secure all the posts firmly in the ground so they do not move at all, and insert a rounded stick which is the screw on which the bandage is wound through the holes of the two posts.
And in its end a hole in which is secured a stick a span in length with which to turn it, and in the other two posts likewise, then tie the bandage which you secured on the patient's chest to the screw at his head and the bandages which you secured on his legs to the screw at his feet.
Then an assistant stands at each screw turning it with his hand using the handle which turns the screw while the physician aligns the hump as we described before, and this is the illustration of the screw and the bench and the patient:
Then after the vertebra returns and the area becomes level, you should apply the drying dressing with egg white then the oakum then place above the dressing a splint of wood that is three fingers wide or so and its length should be enough to cover the area of the hump.
And on some of the healthy vertebrae, then it is bound with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses mild nourishment until healing. If some protrusion remains in the area after healing, medicines that relax and soften should be used along with the board we described for a long time.
A lead plate may be used for this, and a protrusion may appear in the last vertebrae of the back which might be thought to be a dislocation, but it is an additional protruding bone, so do not attempt this treatment for it as death may occur.
Chapter Thirty-One
On the Treatment of the Dislocated Hip
Know that the hip joint and shoulder joint only experience dislocation and do not experience what other joints experience in terms of slight displacement and concavity. The hip joint dislocates in four ways.
It dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward, most commonly inward and rarely forward or backward. The sign of its dislocation inward is that when you compare the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, it will be longer.
The knee will protrude more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his leg at the groin, and the area near the groin will be notably swollen because the head of the femur has moved there.
The signs of outward dislocation are opposite to these symptoms, and the sign of forward dislocation is that the patient can extend their leg completely but cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if they attempt to walk, they cannot move forward.
Their urine is retained, their groin swells, and when walking, they step on the heel. The sign of backward dislocation is that they cannot extend or bend the knee before bending the groin, and their leg is also shorter than the other.
The groin is relaxed and the head of the femur is clearly visible at the flank area. As for reducing these types of dislocations, if the dislocation is old and chronic, and reduction hasn't been attempted and it remained in its condition, there is absolutely no treatment.
It should not be attempted. But if the dislocation is recent, regardless of which of the four types it is, proceed to twist the joint and extend it inward and outward and move it right and left, as it may
return without needing other treatment. If it doesn't return this way, you should prepare a strong, capable assistant to pull the leg from below either with his hands or with a bandage tied above the knee, and another assistant pulls from above.
By putting his hands under the armpits, then securing a soft bandage at the base of the thigh, and a third assistant holds the end of the bandage, pulling either from the front from the groin area toward the clavicle, or from behind toward the back.
They should all pull at once until the patient's body rises from the ground and remains suspended, as this type of traction is common to all four types. If the dislocation returns with what we mentioned, fine, otherwise each type needs its own specific treatment that I will mention.
As for the specific reduction when the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on their healthy side, then place a bandage at the base of the thigh between the head of the femur and the area below the groin.
Then pull the bandage upward from the groin area to the upper body toward the clavicle, then another strong, capable assistant should embrace the thick part of the affected thigh with his arms and pull strongly outward, and it will return to its place.
This type is easier than other types of treatment for reducing this limb. If it proves difficult and doesn't respond to insertion with this type of treatment at all, you should bind both legs of the patient with a strong, soft bandage at the ankles and knees.
And each one should be four fingers apart from their companion, and the afflicted leg should be extended more than the other by about two fingers, then the patient is suspended from the head from a wooden beam in the house, being about two forearms' length from the ground.
Then order a strong servant to embrace the head of the thigh, and another servant to hold onto the patient, and the other servant who is embracing the thigh pushes with force, for the joint will quickly return to its place. As for its specific reduction when the dislocation is outward:
The patient should lie on the bench as we described for the person with kyphosis, and the bandage should be tied specifically on his afflicted leg and on his chest, then two wooden pieces are placed - one at his feet and the other at his head - then an additional wooden piece is placed in the middle of the bench, very securely fastened.
It should be wrapped with moist rags so as not to harm the patient, to be between his thighs so he doesn't get pulled downward during the extension. Then each servant pulls to his side while the physician aligns the hip with his hands. If it responds by returning,
And if not, place the board on it and compress it as we mentioned for kyphosis exactly, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side. And if the dislocation is forward, the patient's leg should be extended at once while he is in this same position on the bench.
The physician places his right palm on the afflicted groin then presses it with the other hand, and with that makes the pressure extend downward toward the knee. And if the dislocation is backward, the patient should not be extended downward.
While elevated from the ground, rather he should be placed on something solid, as should also be done for one whose hip is dislocated outward, as we mentioned regarding his lying on the bench while on his face with the bandages tied.
As we said just now, and compression with the board should also be used on the location to which the joint has moved. When the reduction of the hip joint is completed properly - and the sign of its reduction will not be hidden from you - you should extend the patient's legs.
If you see them even and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the limb has returned properly. At that point, join the thighs together and apply the dressing and bind with a turban so tightly that the hip cannot move in any direction.
The patient must remain still for three or four days, then undo the binding and dressing and compare the leg with the other. If you see them equal in length, know that the dislocation has set, so allow the patient to walk. And if you see any looseness in it,
Return and dress it and bind it as you bound it the first time and leave it again for three days, then undo it, and he should walk on it slowly for days until it strengthens well, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Two
On Treating Dislocation of the Knee
The knee dislocates in three ways: it dislocates inward, outward, and downward - meaning backward - and it never dislocates forward at all. The sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to join his leg to his thigh.
If it doesn't attach to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. And the reduction of all types of its dislocation is that you have the patient sit while extending his legs if he is able to do that, and have a servant sit behind him to hold his waist and bend him backward slightly, then you sit on his thighs.
And you place your back to his face and put his leg between your legs, then grip his knee with your palms and interlock your fingers over his knee, then squeeze the sides of his knee strongly with your palms while another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg attaches to the thigh smoothly without force. Then dress it and attach the leg to the thigh, then bind them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release them, and he should only walk a little for days until it strengthens.
If its return proves difficult with what we described, then use strong extension with the bandages which I previously described in the treatment of the hip until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of ankle dislocation.
The ankle may become slightly displaced or completely dislocated, and its dislocation can be either inward or outward, and the sign of its dislocation is that you see the ankle swollen and protruding in the direction of the dislocation.
As for treating its displacement, its reduction is easy: it should be gently pulled by hand and adjusted until it returns, but as for treating it when it is completely dislocated, the patient should be seated and a strong assistant should hold him from behind at his waist.
Then you should hold his foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below his foot at the location of the Achilles tendon, then pull the foot toward you with your right hand then with your left hand twice, then extend it with your left hand and push the front of the foot with your right hand toward the leg without force.
Do this twice as we described, then push the front of the foot toward the leg the third time while pulling the Achilles tendon, and if it returns after one or two times in this manner and you see the foot straight, fine, otherwise repeat the procedure for it will return.
If its return is prevented by what we described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground and drive a peg firmly into the ground to fall between his thighs, having wrapped it with rags so as not to harm the patient, then an assistant should hold his thigh.
Then another assistant pulls the leg either with his hands or with a bandage tied to the neck of the leg, then each assistant pulls opposite to his companion's pull while the peg stands between the patient's thighs holding him so his body is not drawn downward during the pulling, then the physician adjusts the dislocation with his hands.
And another assistant holds the healthy leg downward for the dislocation will return quickly, and when the dislocation returns and you confirm its proper return, apply the dressing and lint and bind it with firm bandages and secure the foot with the bandage downward, and you should be cautious of the nerve that is above the ankle from behind.
Lest the bandage be too tight on it and harm it, then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage loosens then tighten it, then release it on the third or fourth day, and the patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this period, you cannot be sure that the dislocation won't recur and deteriorate and not accept treatment afterward, and if hot swelling occurs, you should use for its relief what we previously described in other places regarding treatment and fomentation until it subsides.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On treating toe dislocations.
You should adjust what has been dislocated with slight pulling without force, and this is not difficult but easy, and if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the top of the foot, the patient should place his foot on a level place on the ground.
Or on a board while standing as if walking, then you stand and place your foot on what protrudes from those joints then press it with your foot firmly until it returns and you see it has straightened and no protrusion appears in the place.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that takes the whole foot having two ends, then bind it with a firm, secure binding for three days then unfasten it and protect it from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are assured against recurrence, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On types of dislocations that occur with wounds or with fractures or with both together.
When any of this occurs and you attempt to treat and set it, it often results in death.
Therefore, none should attempt to treat such cases except one who is skilled in the craft, of long experience, gentle, compassionate, patient, neither rash nor bold, and should use at the beginning only medications that calm hot swellings and entrust the patient.
To divine decree, except for those cases where you hope for safety from harm with mild illness and some hope appears to you in it, then attempt its reduction immediately at the start before hot swelling occurs.
If the limb returns as you intended, then use the regimen that calms hot swellings and treat the wound with what suits it from drying ointments, and if the dislocation is with fracture and splinters appear in the bone protruding, attempt to remove them.
And follow in that what we mentioned regarding simple diseases from what preceded in their places.
And do your utmost and keep yourself from entering the path of risk as per my previous advice to you, for that is more lasting for your status and safer for your reputation, God willing.
