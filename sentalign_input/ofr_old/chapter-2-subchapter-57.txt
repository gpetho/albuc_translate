of circumcision
Circumcision is not like the healing of other wounds; however, when we perform this procedure willingly, especially on children, it is necessary to make it the best and safest operation.
I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision of their children because they did not use it in their law, and we only have what we have learned through experience.
For I have seen most of the masters and surgeons performing circumcision with a scalpel, and scissors, and with a razor; the procedure was faulty because there are two layers, and perhaps they cut the top one and leave the one underneath.
Now it must be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and with the scalpel, the tip of the member is not secure; and with the razor, the blade might slip and cause complications, and often they heal without needing treatment, as I have seen.
Regarding the circumcision done with scissors and a thread tie, I have found it to be effective because the scissors cut both above and below equally well.
For when you press your hand, it cuts evenly in one go; but the thread must be tightly tied around the skin; and the way of the first procedure is to make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then make him enjoy in all the ways you can;
then make him stand between your hands straight, and hide the scissors in your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them or any of the instruments; then place your hand on the penis and blow on the tip, and pull it up so that the tip of the penis is inside; then clean it well from the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it again slightly lower with another tie; and hold it with two fingers at the second tie at the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the upper skin and pull the tip of the penis;
then let the blood flow little by little because it is cleaner that way; and put powder on it and on the powder a cloth soaked in the white of a cooked egg mixed with rose water, mixed with good and fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
The shape of the scissors for the circumcision is this: the two tips should be thin and sharp, and the tips should be as big as the handle equally:
the mistake of the circumcision is when the inner skin escapes the incision; then it is necessary to stretch it with your nail before the place forms an abscess; and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your nail, hold it with forceps, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and the area below the penis is swollen, then leave it until the hot abscess is soothed, and peel it lightly; then cut it as you can, and be careful of the part of the penis, as it will not harm it at all.
Then treat the area with healing powder that we have mentioned in the powder section, and if you cut the skin too much, and it goes above, it will not harm; treat it as we have said until it is healed.
