On Tooth Extraction and Removal of Fractured Jaw Bones.
Chapter 31.
If a part of the tooth breaks and remains after extraction, place a poultice with butter on the site for one or two days until it softens. Then, insert a tool, such as an algast or forceps, whose tips resemble the beak of a bird known as the stork.
This is the form of the forceps.
The tips should have an inner surface like a file or like aliskilfegi (a type of file or rough surface).
If the tooth does not respond and come out with these forceps, then you must carefully work around the root, exposing all surrounding tissue, and insert an instrument known as the “small lever,” which has this form.
It should have a short, somewhat thick end and should not be too fine, to avoid breaking.
If the root comes out this way, that is ideal. If not, use other tools, which have the following shapes.
The first instrument has a triangular tip with some thickness.
Another is a triangular but finer tip.
Another useful instrument has two branches and this shape.
These tools, along with those previously described for tooth scraping, can be of great assistance.
A further helpful tool resembles a large hook with a twisted, triangular tip of substantial thickness to prevent breakage; it should not be too fine.
Know that there are many dental instruments, and countless other tools as well. A skilled practitioner, clever in their craft, often discovers suitable tools themselves based on the needs of the operation and the specific ailments.
There are some conditions for which the ancients did not provide specific instruments due to the varied nature of such cases.
If a jaw bone or another bone of the mouth fractures or decays, carefully explore the area with the appropriate instruments and forceps mentioned for root extraction, and use a tool called “gesti,” shaped as follows.
The “gesti” should gradually narrow, allowing a firm grip on the bone so it does not slip or move, ensuring complete removal. Then, treat the area with suitable medications.
If there is minor decay in the bone, scrape away the rot and treat the bone until it heals.
