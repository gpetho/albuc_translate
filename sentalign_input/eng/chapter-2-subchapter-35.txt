 CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE.
On the removal of 'ranula' beneath the tongue.
 Sometimes there occurs under the tongue a swelling resembling a small frog, which hinders the natural movements of the tongue; sometimes it grows so as even to fill the mouth.
The operation for it is to open the patient's mouth in the full light of the sun and inspect the tumour.
If you see that it is dark or black, and hard, and the patient has no sensation in it, do not interfere with it, for it is a cancer.
But if it is inclined to be pale and has fluid in it, put a hook in it and incise it with a fine scalpel and free it all round; and if haemorrhage hinders you while operating apply pounded vitriol to it till the bleeding stops.
Then proceed with your work till all is extracted; then let him rinse his mouth out with vinegar and salt.
Then give all the suitable treatment till healed.
