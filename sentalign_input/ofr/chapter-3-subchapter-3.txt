Know that sometimes both parts of the nose above are broken, or just one of them, for there are two bones;
and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, but only bends or twists, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you must insert your little finger into the nostril, and align the fracture inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; 
and do this gently, and be careful that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the spot, then you must align it using the end of a somewhat thick rod. 
And if the break is in two parts, do the same, and hurry to restore it the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot swelling has subsided, then insert linen cloth tents into the end of the nose, if the break is in one part.
Or insert another one on the other side, if the break is there;
and the tents should be so thick that they fill the holes of the nose.
And some restorers say that the tents should be moistened with butter and changed every day. 
It does not seem good to me, but they should be moistened in a mixture of egg white and powder of wheat flour;
then leave the tent until the bone is firm and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are placed in the nose instead of tents, and a soft cloth is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient breathes through it;
now do whatever you wish.
And if hot abscesses appear in the nose while you are working there, apply cerate or cotton moistened with rose oil, or a little diachylon.
And if hot abscesses do not appear there, apply a soothing plaster of sesame flour and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then place light compresses on top, and do not tie the nose;
And if the nasal fracture is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract them with suitable instruments, then sew up the wound, and treat it with flesh-generating and healing things, such as suitable plasters and ointments;
And if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead tubes in it until it is healed.
