When the artery is cut Many times it happens that there are great flows of blood from the artery that is cut at the wound that comes from outside, or from the incision of the abscess, or from the cautery of the member, and similar things; and it is very difficult to stop.

And nevertheless when this happens to someone, hurry to put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press hard enough that the blood calms under your finger, and no drop comes out; then put several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire until they are all red; then take one, either large or small depending on the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you are holding your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is staunched.	When this happens to anyone, quickly apply your hand to the mouth of the artery, putting your forefinger to it and closing it properly till the bleeding ceases under your fingers and nothing comes out. Then put in the fire several olivary cauteries, small and large, and blow on them to make them very hot. Then take one, small or large according to the size of the wound and the site of the opening of the artery, and bring the cautery down right on the artery itself, after promptly removing your finger, and hold the cautery upon it till the blood ceases.	0.9207211
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery goes out, then hastily take another one of the cauteries that are in the fire.	But if it bursts out after you have removed your finger from the mouth of the artery, and the cautery has cooled, promptly take another of the cauteries which you have ready in the fire.	0.82815146
And do not stop doing this one after another until the blood is staunched; and be careful not to burn the nerve that is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient; and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be well staunched especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways we have mentioned: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not pulled, or by strong tying with thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to staunch blood; and let it be tied and pressed appropriately.	Continue doing this, with one after another, till the haemorrhage is stanched. Mind you do not burn any nerve which may be there, so that another calamity afflicts the patient. You should know that when there is arterial haemorrhage it is impossible to stop it, especially when the vessel is big, except in one of four ways, to wit: by the cautery as we have said; or by division of the vessel when it is not completely divided, for when it is cut through the ends of it contract and the bleeding is stopped; or by a strong thread ligature; or by the application of styptics with tight bandaging.	0.90700644
Whoever administers stanching by tightly tying with cloths or applying burning things, or other similar things, will find it helps but little.	But those who try to stop bleeding with ligatures or cloths, or by the application of caustics and the like, never stanch it by these means, or at least very rarely.	0.60221064
And if this happens to someone and he has neither doctor nor medicine present, he must put his index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press hard enough that it is staunched over the wound and over the vein; and not move his finger, but moisten it often with cold water that is very cold until the blood is frozen and thickened and staunched; and afterward do whatever is necessary with cauteries and medicines.	And if this happen to anyone and there are available neither doctor nor remedies, let him at once apply his forefinger to the mouth of the vessel as we have bidden and close it firmly till the blood is stanched; and pour over the wound and over the artery, without removing the finger, water as cold as possible till the blood thickens and congeals and ceases to flow. And meanwhile one should be considering what kind of cautery or medicine is indicated.	0.9094707
