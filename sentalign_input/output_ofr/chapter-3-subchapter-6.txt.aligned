of the fracture of the shoulder	On the repair of a fracture of the scapula.	0.46997616
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks except in a wide place or in the middle, and one does not know it except by touch;	The scapula is rarely fractured in the broad part but it does break at its margins.	0.54806507
so prepare it according to the form of the break, and restore it according to its natural form, in every way that you can;	When any part of it is broken or it breaks in the middle (which is recognized by palpation) you should attempt the correction of the fracture according to the shape it takes, and its restoration to its natural form, by whatever means you can.	0.45121592
then put on the area mill dust with plenty of egg, and light stuffing, and put on a double cloth; then put on a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if under the splint there are hollows in any place on the shoulder, fill that hollow with linen stuffing, so that the splint sits evenly;	Then apply over the place mill-dust with eggwhite, and soft tow; and over that a dressing made of a folded cloth; and over that a broad splint made of thin board to the size of the whole scapula or a little wider. If there be beneath the splint a hollow in any part of the scapula, level it with soft tow so that the splint rests evenly.	0.8694838
and then bind it all firmly with a large bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day;	Then bind tightly over it a long sling and make sure that the splint does not slip out of place.	0.6479931
and every time it loosens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it is out of place, and have the patient lie on their side;	Examine the bandage daily; and whenever it gets loose tighten it and adjust the splint if it has shifted. The patient should lie on his sound side.	0.7502623
and the shoulder is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five.	The scapula mends in twenty or twenty-five days.	0.79345024
And when this time is complete, unbind it, and be certain, for it is not a bone that dislocates easily.	When this time has elapsed you may safely loosen the bandaging, for this is one of the bones in which there is no danger of fragmentation or cracking.	0.71592784
And if a piece of the bone protrudes forward, and points below the heart, then cut over it, and remove it, and do what we have said regarding the breaking of the clavicle to soothe a hot abscess.	If a splinter of bone protrudes and starts to prick under the skin, cut down upon it and remove it, and do as I said under fracture of the collar-bone, to allay the effusion, if anything of that kind happen.	0.7217195
