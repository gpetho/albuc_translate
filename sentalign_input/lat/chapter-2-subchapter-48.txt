On the perforation of abscesses occurring beneath the Titillicus.
Chapter 48.
These abscesses that occur beneath the Titillicus are of the hard types of Strophulas, which contain cysts, and some of them contain fluids.
Those among them that contain fluids must therefore be cut with a crescent-shaped incision, in this form, from line b. to line g. Then, when everything within the abscess is drained of infection, fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.
Then remove the cotton, and treat it with suitable ointment until it heals.
But if the abscess is of the type of Strophula nodes, then incise it above, as we have said in the section on Strophulas.
If, however, the wound extends so that it releases pus, then apply cautery to it, as we have discussed previously.
