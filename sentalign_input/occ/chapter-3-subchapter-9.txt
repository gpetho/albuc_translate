Chapter 9:
Restoration of spinal fractures and neck bones.
Sometimes the bones of the neck fracture, often by pressure, and similarly with the spine.
When this happens, and you want to know if it will heal, consider: if the patient's hands are softened, stupefied, and lifeless, unable to move, extend, or grip, and when you press or prick with a needle, there is no pain, then know it will not heal, and this condition is mostly fatal.
If there is movement and sensation when pressed or pricked, then know the spinal cord is intact, and the patient will recover with treatment.
If the same occurs with neck vertebrae, and you want to know if it will heal, examine the patient's feet.
If the feet are softened and experience the same as the hands, and when lying on their back, the patient passes gas and stool involuntarily, or if they try to urinate and cannot, know it is fatal, and do not attempt treatment.
If none of these conditions occur, the prognosis is better and easier.
The treatment involves sedating the inflamed area by applying rose oil alone or with yolks of roasted eggs several times a day until the inflammation subsides.
Then apply one of the comforting and stimulating plasters, bandage tightly, and advise the patient to rest and avoid lying on the painful side until healed.
If a bone fragment or cause is separated from the pressure, cut over the area and remove the bone; align the wound edges with stitching if large; then treat with healing ointments until healed.
If the last vertebra is broken and at the end of the tailbone, insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus, and align the broken bone with the other hand as possible; then apply plaster and splint if needed, and tighten.
If you feel broken fragments, cut over them, remove, and treat the wound as previously described until healed.
