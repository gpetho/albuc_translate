Chapter sixty-four on the treatment of urinary incontinence with dialia.
The dalia is a twisted, somewhat convoluted swelling, resembling a cluster of grapes, accompanied by relaxation of the testicles and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking.
And in the treatment of this ailment, there are dangers close to what has been mentioned before, but it is necessary to mention the procedure in it as the predecessors did.
So I say that it is necessary to sit the patient on a high chair, then push the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards, then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers along with the vessels that are close to the penis, and have another assistant hold them and stretch them firmly. Then, make an oblique incision with a wide, sharp scalpel along the vessels until the vessels are exposed, then dissect from each side as I mentioned to you in the stripping of the arteries that are in the temples. Then, insert a needle with a doubled thread into them and tie it at the beginning of the places where the dalia appeared, and also tie it at the end.
Then, make an incision in the middle, a straight incision along the length of the body, and remove the turbid, corrupt humors that have gathered there. Then, treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds that you want to heal over time so that the vessels that nourish one of the testicles fall off, and there is no harm in that.
If the dalia affects all the vessels, it is necessary to remove one of the testicles with the vessels so that the testicle does not lack nourishment because of the cutting of the vessels, and thus wither and become useless.
