On Returning the Nasal Septum.
Physicians call the septum a fistula. If you treat it with cautery or with a sharp, burning medication, as described previously, and it does not heal, then there is no recourse but to incise the swelling when it is ripe and extract all the moisture or pus that is in it.
Until the bone is exposed. And when the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, scrape it with an instrument like this:
It is called the rough-headed one; it is made from Indian steel, and its head is round like a button, finely engraved like a file or scraper.  Place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, while you tighten your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away.
Do this several times, then dress the area with desiccating, astringent medications. If the area heals over and flesh grows in it and the discharge stops, and this remains for forty days, and it does not recur, and there is no swelling, and no incident occurs,
then know that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no recourse but to return the fistula to the nostril in this way: you must expose the bone again with an iron instrument or with a sharp medication. When the bone is exposed, take a probe shaped like this:
The tip of the instrument should be triangular, and its shaft conical, tapering towards the tip as you see.  Then place it on the bone itself, close to the nostril, and move your hand slightly away from the eye. Then turn your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it.
He will notice air coming out of it if he holds his hand over his nose. At that point, dress the area with astringent, desiccating medications as I have taught you. When the flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter that was draining outwards will return to the nose, and this will be less distressing for the patient, God willing.
