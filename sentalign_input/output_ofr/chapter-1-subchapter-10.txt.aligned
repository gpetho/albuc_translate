of epilepsy	On cauterizing for epilepsy.	0.49934477
The epileptic should not use cautery except for the one who is phlegmatic, and it is necessary to first cleanse the brain with herbs and other treatments that we have mentioned in the section when the patient is strong and able to tolerate medicine.	The epileptic who may be cauterized is he whose epilepsy arises from phlegm. When the patient is an adult and can stand taking the drugs, he should first purify his brain by great electuaries and the rest of the treatment mentioned in that section.	0.7489301
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate it, make him gargle and chew things that cleanse the brain often with good foods; afterward shave the middle of his head, and make a cautery there according to what we have said before, and a cautery on the forehead, and on each temple; and if the patient is strong and tolerant, make cauteries as I have said for the one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and the neck, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the manner I have described.	But if it be a boy unable to tolerate the drugs he should employ gargles and medicaments to chew, to clear his brain, for several days beforehand, with an improvement in his diet. Then let his head be shaved and burn him with the single cauterization on the middle of the head in the manner described before, and with one cauterization on the occiput, and one on each frontal prominence; and, if the patient be fit and able to bear it, add those additional cauterizations on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae that we have already described for paralysis and for flaccidity. The cautery should be olivary, the shape before described.	0.84967446
If the patient is a child, make a subtle cautery in this manner:	If the patient be a boy, use a fine cautery.	0.74083984
