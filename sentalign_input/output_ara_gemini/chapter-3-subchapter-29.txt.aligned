Fingers may dislocate in any direction.	The fingers may be dislocated in any direction.	0.9860742
So when a finger dislocates to the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns (to its place).	When one of the fingers is dislocated dorsally or ventrally, then extend the finger and thrust the dislocation with your thumb until it goes back.	0.78310084
Then, bind the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the direction to which it was dislocated and leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it straightens itself on that day.	Then bind the head of the phalanx, suspending it in the direction in which it was dislocated, and leave it for two days. Then unbind it and extend it so that it may straighten out all that day.	0.8492942
If you tied it at night in the same manner, continue to untie it during the day and exercise it with movement and tie it at night, doing that for several days until it strengthens.	Then at nightfall bind it in just the same way. Continue to loosen it by day and to exercise it with movement, bandaging it by night. Do this for some days until it is knit.	0.8304265
And do the same with it if it dislocates towards the palm of the hand, tie it towards the same direction and do with it what you did before until it heals.	Do the same with it if it is a ventral dislocation, binding it in that direction, and treat it as explained above until it is healed.	0.757768
And do the same with it whenever it dislocates in any other direction.	Do likewise with dislocations in other directions.	0.7592884
