Chapter Sixty-Nine.
On Castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
Therefore, it would have been fitting for me not to mention it in this book of mine, but I mentioned it for two reasons: one is so that it may be within the physician's knowledge if he is asked about it and so that he knows the treatment for anyone afflicted by it, and the other reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Like lambs, goats, cats, and other such animals.  I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by incision and cutting. The one that is by crushing, the way to perform it is that we sit the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.
Then you crush them with your hand until they dissolve and cannot be discerned by touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie the spermatic cords and make one incision on each testicle.
So that when the testicles protrude, you cut them after peeling them, and leave nothing of the membranes on them except the thin membrane that is on the vessels.  This type of castration is better than the one that is by crushing.
Because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal desires intercourse. Then treat the wound until it heals.
