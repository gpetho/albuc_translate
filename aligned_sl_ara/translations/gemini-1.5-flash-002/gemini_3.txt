The author of this book says: When I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is a part of medical science in its entirety, and have reached the utmost in clarity and explanation, I saw fit to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the practical work.
Because practical work is completely lacking in our country and in our time, so much so that its knowledge is almost extinct and its effect has ceased. And only a few vestiges of it remain in the books of the ancients, which have been spoiled by hands and marred by error and confusion, until its meanings have become obscure and its usefulness has diminished.
Therefore, I saw fit to revive it and compose this treatise on it in a way that is explanatory, clear, and concise, and to include pictures of cauterizing irons and other surgical instruments, since this adds to the clarity and facilitates what is needed.
The reason why there is no skilled craftsman in our time is that the craft of medicine is lengthy and its practitioner must first train in the science of anatomy as described by Galen. until he understands the functions, forms, temperaments, connections, and separations of the organs, and the knowledge of the bones, nerves, muscles, their number, origins, the arteries and veins, their locations and origins.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the craft of surgery, and we have mentioned a part of this in the introduction to this book.
Because whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have mentioned concerning anatomy will inevitably fall into error and kill people thereby, as I have witnessed many times among those who have presumed to know this science and claimed it without knowledge or training.
And that is because I saw an ignorant physician who incised a pig-like tumor in a woman's neck, and severed some of the neck's arteries, so the woman bled until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who proceeded to remove a stone from a man who had been wounded in the bladder; the stone was large, so he acted rashly and removed it with a piece of the bladder substance. So the man died after about three days, and I had been called to remove it; I saw from the size of the stone and the state of the patient that I could have done that.
And I saw another physician who earned his living practicing medicine for some of the brothel keepers of our city.
Then a black boy came to him with a fracture in his leg near the heel, along with a wound.  The physician, in his ignorance, hastily bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and splints very tightly, and did not leave the wound any room to breathe.
Then he gave free rein to his desires, and left him for days and told him not to loosen the bandage until his leg and foot swelled up and he was on the verge of death.
So I was called to him, and I quickly loosened the bandage; he was relieved and free from his pains, except that the corruption had become firmly established in the limb and I could not prevent it.
Then the corruption continued to spread in the limb until he died.
And I saw another physician cauterize a cancerous tumor, which ulcerated after days until his patient's affliction greatly increased.  That is because if a cancer is purely from black humor, then it should never be touched with an iron instrument at all.
Except if it is in a limb that can be entirely excised.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual operations are divided into two parts: an operation accompanied by safety and an operation accompanied by harm in most cases.
And I have warned in every place that comes in this book about the operation that contains risk and fear, so you should avoid and reject it.
Lest the ignorant find a way to criticize and attack, take for yourselves caution and circumspection, and for your patients gentleness and deliberation.
And use the best method leading to safety and a favorable outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases that are difficult to cure.
And purify yourselves from what you fear might cast suspicion on your religion and your worldly affairs, for this is more lasting for your reputation and higher in this world and the next for your status.
For Galen said in some of his precepts, "Do not treat a bad disease, lest you become a bad physician.
This chapter has been divided into three sections.
The first section.
On cauterization with fire and cauterization with strong medicine, methodically arranged from head to foot, with images of the instruments and cautery irons, and everything needed for the work by hand.
And the second section.
On incision, puncturing, bloodletting, cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows and the like, all methodically arranged, with images of the instruments.
And the third section.
On setting, reduction, and the treatment of dislocations and the like, methodically arranged from head to foot, with images of the instruments.
The first section.
On cauterization.
And before we mention its use, it is necessary to mention the manner of its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.
So I say that the discussion of the manner of the benefit of cauterization and its harms is a long discussion and a precise science and a hidden secret, and a group of wise men have spoken of it.
And they differed in it, and I have shortened from their speech the little [amount], for fear of lengthening.
So I say that cauterization generally benefits every bad temperament that is with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments, and they are the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they differed in it.  Some of them said that cauterization is beneficial in it, and others said the opposite of that, that cauterization is not suitable in a disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is impossible to be cured of a hot dry disease with a hot dry medicine. And he who says the opposite of that said that cauterization with fire may benefit from a hot dry disease that occurs in the bodies of people. Because when you add the body of man and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the body of man cold.
And I say as he says, because experience has revealed that to me many times, except that one should not imagine that matter except one who has trained and practiced in the matter of cauterization a thorough training. And he has understood the difference in the temperaments of people and the state of diseases in themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and their duration.
But as for the other temperaments, there is no fear from them, especially the cold and moist diseases. All physicians have agreed upon them and have not differed in the benefit of cauterization in them.
And know, O my son, that of the secret of treatment, cauterization with fire and its advantage over cauterization with a burning medicine, is that fire is a simple element whose action does not exceed the member that is cauterized, and it does not harm another connected member except a little harm.
And cauterization with a burning medicine may extend its effect to what is beyond the members, and perhaps it produces in the member a disease difficult to treat, and perhaps it kills.  And fire, because of its nobility and the excellence of its essence, does not do that except if one is excessive.
And this has become clear to us by experience, through long service and attention to the craft and understanding of the realities of the matter.
For this reason I have dispensed with lengthy discourse.  Were it not unbecoming of this book of mine, I would have presented to you concerning fire a hidden secret and the manner of its action in bodies and its expulsion of diseases with philosophical, demonstrative discourse too subtle for your understanding.
And know, O my sons, that they have differed concerning the time suitable for cauterization, and they have considered the best time to be springtime.
And I say that cauterization is suitable at every time, because the harm occurring from the time is consumed by the benefit which is brought about by cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for strong, urgent, necessary pains which do not tolerate delay, because of the fear that what follows from them may be a calamity greater than the slight harm incurred from the time.
And let it not occur to you, O my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization which cures a disease will never have a recurrence, and make it a necessity.
And the matter is not as they suppose, because cauterization is only like a medicine which changes the temperament and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
Except that cauterization is preferred to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its power.
And it is possible that the disease may return after a time, according to the temperament of the patient, the strength of his disease, and what may be prepared in his body from the gathering of impurities in it, and his neglect of himself in acquiring them from foods and the like of such causes.
Except that the disease in which cauterization is used is a mild disease and in a member with few impurities and humors. Like cauterizing a tooth for pain and the like, for it may be possible that that pain does not return, and that is in the least.
And as for the common people's saying also that cauterization is the last of medicine, it is a correct saying, not to what they go to, for they believe that no treatment is beneficial with medicine or otherwise after the occurrence of cauterization, and the matter is otherwise.
And the meaning of cauterization being the last of medicine is only that when we use types of treatment in a disease and those medicines do not work, then we use cauterization as the last thing, and it works, so from here it happened that cauterization is the last of medicine. Not in the meaning to which the common people and many ignorant physicians went.
And the ancients mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they only said that because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence, and they said that the place of cauterization does not suppurate, and that is not absolutely so.
Because I have tried that and found that it only does that in some bodies, not others, and cauterization with it is better and preferable to iron, as they said, except that if you heat the cautery iron in the fire, made of gold, you will not know when it is heated to the degree you want because of the redness of the gold.
And because it quickly becomes cold, and if you increase its heat in the fire, it melts and is spoiled, and the craftsman falls into trouble because of that. Therefore, cauterization with iron is quicker and closer to the truth for us to use, God willing.
And I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections which I have organized from head to foot, so that it may be easy for the student to find what he wants, God willing.
The first section.
In cauterizing the head, one cauterization.
This cauterization benefits from the excess of moisture and coldness on the brain, which are the causes of headache, and frequent colds from the head to the area of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, and toothache and throat pains. And in general, for every illness that arises from cold, such as paralysis, epilepsy, and catalepsy, and similar illnesses.
The method of this cauterization is that you first order the patient to vomit with a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, his age, and his habit.
Then you order him to shave his head with a razor, then you seat him before you cross-legged, having placed his hands on his chest.
Then you place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes; where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, whose image is this.
Expose the bone to the extent of the head of a date pit or the size of a carob seed. Then raise your hand, otherwise reapply your hand with the same instrument, or another, if it has cooled. Until you see of the bone what I mentioned to you. Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a cotton swab in it; apply it to the place and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton swab soaked in butter to it and leave it there until the eschar from the cautery separates. Then treat it with the quaternary ointment until it heals, God willing.
And they have said that the longer a wound remains open, the more pus it discharges, and this is better and more beneficial.
Some have mentioned cauterizing the skin to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the thickness of the bone is burned, then removing what was burned from the bone, and then treating it.
And others said that one should exaggerate with the cautery until it strongly affects the bone, until it falls from the bone in the shape of a carat or a small disc.  And they claimed that this vents the vapors of the head from that place, and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals. And I do not see these two types of cautery at all except in some people, and in a haphazard way.  Leaving it [untreated] is better in my opinion, and for safety. If it [the cautery] is done, then the head weakens when its natural connection is broken, as we have seen in other members.
Especially if the head of the patient is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and it is what I use, so use it and you will be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
Also on cauterizing the head.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head, and it lasts for the patient, and poultices, collyria, snuffs, ointments, and dressings have been used, especially if a single cauterization as we have described has been performed and nothing has benefited him, then look. If the patient's head is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, cauterize him again a little above the previous cauterization. Then cauterize each horn of his head until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone we described is exposed. And cauterize him in the back of his head in the place known as the hatchet, and lighten your hand in this and do not expose the bone, for the patient will find this very painful, unlike the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head, and I will mention this cauterization in its place.
The cautery with which the horns of the head and its back are cauterized should be gentler than the cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.  This is its image.
Chapter Three.
Cauterization of non-chronic migraine.
If pain occurs in a fissure of the head along with headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then let the patient vomit with purgative medicines for the head, and use all the treatment that I mentioned in the divisions of diseases. If that does not work, then cauterization is done in two ways. Either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine or with iron.
As for cauterization with a burning medicine, take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends from both sides. Then, incise the place of pain in the temple with a wide scalpel until there is a space under the skin that can accommodate the clove.
Then insert it under the skin until it disappears.  Then bind it tightly with bandages, and leave it for about fifteen hours. Then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then dress it.
Apply a cotton pledget soaked in butter until the place suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.  If you wish, you may do this with some of the burning medicines which I gave in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
As for cauterization with iron, it is in this manner: heat the cautery, which is of this form:
It is called the nail cautery because its head is like the head of a nail; it has some perforation and in its middle a small projection.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand, turning the cautery little by little; the amount you burn should be about half the thickness of the skin. Raise your hand so that you do not burn the artery underneath and cause bleeding. Then soak cotton in salt water and apply it to the area and leave it for three days. Then dress the cotton with butter, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the knife-like end of the cautery, taking care not to cut the artery in this chronic migraine, especially.
Chapter Four.
Cauterization of chronic migraine.
If you treat the migraine with the aforementioned treatments and what we mentioned in the classifications of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, and you see a cause for which the first cauterization with medicine or fire cauterization is not sufficient. Then you should heat the knife-like cautery until it glows white, after you have marked the painful area with a line half a fingerbreadth long or so, and you should withdraw your hand once while pulling it so that you cut the artery and reach toward the bone.
However, you should be careful to avoid touching the jaw, which moves when chewing, lest you burn the muscle or its motor nerve, which would cause spasms.
And be cautious and watchful of bleeding from the artery that you cut, for there is danger in cutting it. Especially for one who is ignorant of what he is doing and is not a skilled and experienced practitioner; leaving it alone is better.
And the treatment of bleeding that occurs from the artery will be mentioned in its place in the book, God willing, if you see something in the condition that this cauterization cannot manage.
And you saw that the patient's body could tolerate it, cauterize in the middle of the head as we described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on opening the artery with the double-bladed cautery, for it is a better and more effective cautery than this.
Chapter Five.
On cauterizing earaches.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with purgatives and other treatments that we mentioned in the classification, and the pain does not go away, then heat the cautery iron called the point, whose image is this.
Then, after heating it, apply it to the area around the whole ear as it goes around, or around both if the pain is in both. And keep the cauterization a little distance from the base of the ear, after marking the spot with ink.  The cauterization should be about ten points in each ear or thereabouts. Then treat the areas until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six.
Cauterization of Paralysis.
The paralysis treated by cauterization is that type which arises from phlegm, as I have mentioned in the classification of diseases.
And one should avoid cauterizing the type which arises from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you have treated this type of paralysis with plasters, snuffs, and gargles, and your treatment has not been effective, then it is necessary that the patient be cauterized with three cauterizations. One at the root of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
And make your cauterization on the opposite side from the diseased side, because the relaxation occurs on the side which appears healthy.
The method of cauterization is to cauterize with a cautery opposite the upper tip of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple, its length being the length of the thumb.
Lower your hand with the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the cautery iron; it is a type of scalpel, the image of which has preceded, but it is a little gentler, as you see. The scalpel should be a little thicker than usual. Then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
Cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
If the apoplexy becomes chronic and you treat it with what we have mentioned, and your treatment is not effective, and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize him in four places. One cauterization on each temple, one in the middle of the head as previously mentioned, and one at the back of the head as previously described.
The application of the cautery is as previously described.  It may also be cauterized on the stomach, which will be more effective, then treat as before.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterization for forgetfulness.
If it is caused by phlegm, the patient should first be given strong purgatives and brain-cleansing pills.
Then his entire head should be shaved, and a mustard plaster, described in the chapter on plasters, should be applied to the back of his head repeatedly, for this is a kind of cauterization.
Do this in the same manner as I described there; if he is cured by this, well and good; otherwise, perform three cauterizations on the back of his head, arranged in a row from the top of the head to the nape of the neck.
Make the distance between each cauterization the width of a finger. Then treat the cauterization as described above. If you wish to increase [the treatment] and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle area.
If you wish to increase [the treatment], cauterize the temples, then treat it until it heals. The cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterizing paralysis and general body relaxation.
It is necessary that you first proceed to purify the head with the purgatives and what we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head, then cauterize: one cauterization in the middle of the head, one on each temple, and one on the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck. If, in the case of relaxation of the body, you need more than that, and the patient can tolerate it, and the disease is strong and persistent, then cauterize four times on the vertebrae of his back. And continue cauterizing until you burn most of the skin, then lift your hand, then treat him as previously mentioned until he is healed, God willing.  The cautery should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterizing epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm should be cauterized.  First, his brain should be cleansed with strong purgatives and with all the other treatments we mentioned in the classification, if the patient is an adult and able to take medicines.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then use gargles and mouthwashes that cleanse the brain many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then shave his head, and cauterize him with one cauterization in the middle of the head, as described previously, and another cauterization at the back of the head. And one cauterization on each temple. If the patient is strong and able to tolerate it, cauterize him with the cauterizations mentioned for the person with paralysis and body relaxation, on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back; and let the cautery be olive-shaped, as described previously.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauterizations we mentioned for the paralytic.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined toward black bile and the patient's body is moist, purge him so that it cleanses his brain, as was previously explained in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tightly woven cake of linen like a circle, then place it in the middle of his head while the patient sits cross-legged, holding it from each side, then take one pound of old sheep tallow.
Then heat it over a fire with moderate heat, as much as the finger can tolerate when inserted into it, then pour it into the middle of his head in the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this for the patient once every week, along with all other good treatment, until he is cured, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small punctures without holding the cautery iron in your hand but rather by sprinkling, for this type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply to it cotton soaked in tallow or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing a running eye.
If the onset of a running eye becomes apparent to you with the signs I mentioned in the classification, then act quickly and purge the patient of whatever fouls his head, and purify him of all humors, and sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize him in the middle of the head, then cauterize him twice on the temples if the running is from both eyes, or on one side if it is from one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin, and let the cauterizations be lengthwise across the temples, and guard against bleeding.
If you see any of it, cut it on the spot with any remedy you can, and I will come to the wisdom in cauterizing and cutting arteries and guarding against bleeding.
And he may be cauterized in the nape of the neck under the two bones with two strong cauterizations.
Chapter Thirteen.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic weeping sores.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and are from the veins and arteries on the surface of the head, from outside the head, and you are certain that this is from cold, thick, phlegmatic superfluities, then cauterize it with the cauterization that I described in the beginning for the descending water. A cauterization in the middle of the head and two cauterizations on the temples and two cauterizations in the nape of the neck under the two bones. And if you need more, then cauterize one cauterization on each side of the corner of the eye at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter Fourteen.
Concerning the cauterization of a foul-smelling nose.
If you treat it with what we mentioned in the section and the treatment is not effective, then immediately purge the patient with colocynth for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle with an olive-shaped cautery. Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery, two cauterizations above the eyebrows, a little below the hair, and be careful of the artery, do not cut it. And this is the image of the nail-shaped cautery.
Chapter Fifteen.
Concerning the cauterization of eyelid ptosis.
If an eyelid is relaxed due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize a little above the eyebrows, two cauterizations on each side, keeping them distant from the temples, and let the length of each cauterization be the length of the eyebrow.
And do not exaggerate with the cautery, but only to the extent that one-third of the skin is burned, and the shape of the cautery is in this manner.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its margins turn inward so that it pricks the eye, then cauterization is of two types. Either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a caustic medicine. As for cauterization with fire, you should order the patient beforehand to leave his eyelashes alone, if he is one who plucks them, until they grow long and even.
If they prick him while they are growing, then tie his eyes with a bandage lest they move until they grow. When they have grown and become even, place the patient's head in your lap, then mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of an ivy leaf.
The beginning of the mark should be near the margins. Then place under the eyelid a piece of cotton soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a lizard. Then heat a cautery iron, its shape being this.
Then cauterize according to the mark you made, little by little, many times, until the surface of the skin, which is in the shape of the ivy leaf, is completely burned, especially its surface. A sign of the success of your work is to see the eyelid wrinkle and the hair rise from the flesh of the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days. Then apply cotton with butter to it until the scab is removed. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If some of the hair returns later and the eyelid relaxes,
repeat the cauterization in that place as you did before. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural place and does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with a caustic medicine, it is that you tell the patient to leave the margins until they grow long and even.
Then make from paper the shape of an ivy leaf. Then take of the usual soap and of unslaked lime, of each one a drachm weight or so. Crush them both well together, and do this quickly lest it dry. Then spread some of it on the paper you made in the shape of an ivy leaf, and place it on one or both eyelids.  Place cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head in your lap.
And place your index finger on top of the medicine and press it gently, while you move it whenever the patient feels the sting of the medicine, for he will feel a burning sensation. As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. When the burning stops, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And look: if you see that the eyelid has risen as it rises when cauterized with fire or by cutting, otherwise repeat the medicine on the place where the medicine did not take effect and did not blacken, until you complete your work and the eyelid is cauterized. Then place cotton with butter on it until the burning subsides.
Then treat it with palm ointment or another until it heals.  It is necessary for you during the operation to be extremely careful that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after several days, and something is suspected in the eye,
then repeat the medicine on that place of the eyelid which has relaxed, specifically as you did initially, then treat it until it heals. This is the image of an ivy leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, so your cauterization should be according to that. The correct method is not hidden from one who has experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the polyp that appears in the corner of the eye.
If you treat the polyp with what we have mentioned in the sections on diseases and your treatment is not effective, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
You should order the patient to place his head in your lap, and a servant should hold his head between your hands in such a way that it does not move or shake.
Then you place a cotton swab moistened with egg white or saliva on his eyes, then you heat the cautery, whose image is this.
It should be hollow like the quill of an eagle's feather from one end, which is the cauterizing end. And if you wish, it can be perforated at the other end; and if you wish, it can be solid like a gimlet, but this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then you squeeze the polyp if it is open and remove its contents and dry it; or if it is not open, you open it and remove its pus. Then you apply the cautery to it while it is very hot, holding it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And move your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose during cauterization, lest your hand waver or the patient be disturbed, and the cautery fall into the conjunctiva and damage it. If you reach the bone with the first cauterization, that is well and good; otherwise, reapply the cautery a second time if needed.
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton with butter to it and treat it with drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed, and treat it according to what will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing a polyp, mentioned by some of the ancients: you aim at the location of the polyp, incise it, then place a thin cone in the incision itself; this is its image.
And you pour into it an amount equal to the weight of a dirham of molten lead, and hold your hand to the cone firmly and steadily, and the patient must not move at all, lest the molten lead flow into his eye.  It is necessary to place cotton soaked in egg white or water on the patient's eye.
For the lead will burn the site of the polyp and cure it miraculously. If the polyp heals with the cauterization and treatment we have mentioned, that is well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to use the perforation of the nose and return the polyp to the nasal passage, as will be described in its special place.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing a cleft lip.
A cleft often occurs in the lip, which is called a harelip, especially in the lips of children; it often happens. If you treat this cleft with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment is ineffective, then heat a small, knife-shaped cautery in this manner.
Its cavity should be as fine as a knife; then quickly apply it, while hot, to the cleft itself, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft. Then treat it with the kyrioti, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing a polyp occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling appears at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then it suppurates and bursts, and from the running pus a fistula results, and you treat it but the treatment is ineffective, then you should heat a cautery to the extent that it fits in the fistula.
Then insert it, hot, into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end. Do this once or twice, then treat it afterwards with what we have mentioned of treatment until it heals, God willing.
If the material is cut off and it heals, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to examine the place and remove the diseased bone, according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On cauterizing loose molars and gums.
If the gums are loose from moisture and the molars move, and you have treated them with medication without effect, then place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the cautery iron, whose image comes after this, after you have placed the tube on the tooth.
And insert the hot cautery iron quickly, and hold your hand a little until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then raise your hand, then return the cautery iron several times as you wish, then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water.
And let him hold it for an hour and then spit it out; for the loose tooth will become firm, and the loose gum will tighten, and the putrid moisture will dry.
Chapter twenty-one.
On cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is from cold, or if there are worms in it, and medication has not been effective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fat, or cauterization with fire.
As for cauterization with fat, you take cow's fat and boil it in an iron spoon or in a shell, then you take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, then dip it in the boiled fat and quickly apply it to the aching tooth and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat it several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.  If you wish, you may dip wool or cotton in cold fat and apply it to the aching tooth, and place a heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, take a copper or iron tube, somewhat thick in its body so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then heat the cautery iron, whose shape is shown, and place it on the tooth itself, holding your hand until the iron cools. Do this repeatedly.
Then the pain will go away, either that same day or the next. After the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good fat and hold it for an hour, then spit it out. This is the shape of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, according to what is possible. This is the shape of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing polyps.
If the polyps are due to phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to ripening medications, and you desire a quick ripening, heat a hollow cautery iron, which has this shape, perforated at both ends.
So that the smoke exits from the other end during cauterization. Apply it gently to the tumor once and again if necessary, until you reach the depth of the tumor.  If the tumor is small, make the cautery iron the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply cotton soaked in butter to it until what was burned by the fire is gone. Then treat it with ointment and tents until it heals, God willing.
Chapter twenty-three.
On cauterization for hoarseness and shortness of breath.
If humors prevail in the trachea, especially if this is accompanied by a cold temperament, then the patient should first be purged with purgative medicines, then cauterize with a cautery in the hollow of the neck at the root of the throat in the lower place.
Beware of reaching the throat with the cautery and do not burn more than half of the skin. Then cauterize another cautery at the joint of the neck at the end of its last vertebra, and let the cautery be nail-shaped in the manner previously described.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On cauterizing lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the disease is chronic, cauterize two cauteries above the clavicles in the low, soft, empty places, and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And let the cautery be nail-shaped in the manner previously described; and if you wish, let your cautery be punctate with the cautery called the point, the image of which has been previously shown in puncturing earache, and let the points number about thirty.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he is healed. You may also make a cautery with three branches in this manner, and hasten the cauterization with it, for you cauterize three cauteries at once with it.  This is the image of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated because of slippery humors, or if it does not remain in place when reduced from its dislocation, so that it becomes habitual for it to be relocated then dislocate at the slightest movement, as we have witnessed, then it is necessary to replace the joint first. Then the patient lies on his back or on his healthy side, then the skin inside the armpit is lifted upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint has dislocated inwards.
Then heat the cautery with two points, of which this is the image.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will be four cauterizations; and it may be cauterized with a cautery with three points, so the shape of the cauterization will then be six cauterizations, and the points should be delicate.
And this is an image of the cautery with three points.
And this number may be increased by one, so that the cauterizations become eight; then apply to the cauterization finely ground balls with salt, then have the patient rest and not move the limb for a while until it strengthens, and if the dislocation is upwards, which is rarely the case.
Then cauterize above the shoulder with one good, nail-shaped cauterization or numerous cauterizations in dots, for the joint will become firm, the moisture will depart, and the patient will heal.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In cauterizing the stomach.
If coldness and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, to the extent that it is deranged from its temperament, and if many catarrhs occur in it, and it is treated with various treatments without success, then the patient should lie on his back, extend his legs and arms, and then be cauterized with three cauterizations. One cauterization below the sternum, the size of a finger, with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauterizations lower down on either side of the first cauterization, so that the shape of the cauterizations is triangular, and farther apart so that they do not merge if they suppurate. The depth of the cauterization should be about two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and this should be the shape of the cauterizations.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cautery with which you perform this single cauterization should be circular in shape, in this manner.
And the stomach may be cauterized by puncturing it, for one who is apprehensive of this cauterization.  This is done by marking points on the stomach with ink to the extent desired, then cauterizing them with a punctate cautery, and then treating it with the previously mentioned treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the cold cauterization of the liver.
If pain arises in the liver from coldness and dampness, or from a subtle wind, so that it departs excessively from its natural temperament, and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the classification, and this does not benefit. Then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and three cauterizations are marked with ink in this shape and this exact amount on the liver, below the diaphragm, where the elbow of a person ends.
And after each cauterization, a cauterization will be [made] the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization will be straight along the body, and do not press the iron firmly.
And let the amount of thickness of the skin that you burn be half, no more, and let the patient stand on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him lie down with his legs extended and his arms raised.  And this is the image of the cautery iron.
And you may cauterize these cauterizations with the scalpel-like cautery iron if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and be cautious lest you overdo the cauterization and burn all the skin, burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines, for the skin there is thin; so know this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cauterizing a swelling of the liver.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you wish to know if that swelling is in the liver's flesh or in its peritoneum, then if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient will find heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the peritoneum of the liver, there will be intense sharpness with the pain, and you see that the physicians have been exhausted in treating it, then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, then you mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire; it is the cautery that resembles a hoe, and this is its image. And cauterize it with one cauterization until you burn all the skin and the cauterization reaches the peritoneum, until all the matter comes out, then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.
And this type of cauterization should not be used except by one whose training in the craft of medicine has been long and who has repeatedly experienced these diseases; then he may undertake such a work, but leaving it is better in my opinion.
Chapter twenty-nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients mentioned cauterization with the roots of rhubarb for a cold fistula in this manner: that you take one long, dry root of rhubarb, the longest you can find, and it should be about the thickness of a finger, then you dip it in oil and roast it in the fire. Then you cauterize with one cauterization between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauterizations a little below the jugular veins, slightly inclined towards the side under the chin, and two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two cauterizations also between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined backwards, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest and another above the stomach, and three cauterizations from behind: one between the shoulders and two on the sides of the spine, lower than the cauterization which is between the shoulders.
And you should not deepen your hand with the cauterization, but it should be superficially on the skin.  Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used a cautery of iron like a probe; they would heat it and insert it between the ribs until it reached the tumor itself.
And it expels the pus as we mentioned in the tumor of the liver.  And in this method of cauterization there is danger; either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula forms in the area which will not heal.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If you treat the disease of the spleen with what we mentioned in the classification and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization is in three ways, all correct. One is to cauterize it with three or four cauterizations arranged lengthwise along the spleen.
In the shape of the liver cauterizations whose shape we presented, and between each cauterization and the next is the thickness of a finger or a little more.  The nature of the cautery is the same as that which we mentioned in cauterizing the liver. Do not deepen your hand with the cautery and the patient's position is lying on his back.
The other method is in the armpit, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left armpit ends, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left armpit ends, and your lifting of the skin is across the body so that the cauterizations fall along the body.
Then you insert the two cautery irons, very carefully, until you pass them through the skin on the other side, then you remove the cautery iron, so the cauterizations are four. And if you wish, you can cauterize with the other cautery iron with the three points.
Then you treat the place of the cauterization after you leave it to discharge pus for many days; this is more effective than all the treatments mentioned previously.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On cauterization for dropsy.
Cauterization is only beneficial in ascites specifically, if you treat the patient with dropsy using the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification, and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, and a cauterization on the spleen, and two cauterizations on his back between the vertebrae, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin. Then you leave the cauterization open to discharge pus for a long time.
And do not neglect the patient after cauterization with what is necessary to gather the humors for him so that healing may hasten to him. The shape of the cauterizing iron with which the back is cauterized is nail-shaped, as its form has preceded.  That with which the abdomen is cauterized is olive-shaped.
Chapter thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the depression between the little finger and the ring finger.
And place your hand with the cauterizing iron and do not bend it, then raise your hand and do not return it at all, for the yellow water will ooze out, and the cauterizing iron is of this shape.
Then cauterize on the legs, two cauterizations on each leg, and the cauterization is to be with the sharp end of the cauterizing iron, and the cauterization is to be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below it towards the middle of the leg, and on each thigh, two cauterizations.
And leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time so that the water may ooze out, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and dampness to the point of weakening the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and this has been treated with various treatments and it has not healed, and you see the patient able to withstand cauterization and strong, then cauterize him with a large cauterization on his stomach. As preceded in cauterizing the stomach with the circular cautery iron and four cauterizations around the navel gently with the gentle nail-shaped cautery iron and a large cauterization on the coccyx with cotton or two cauterizations.
If you see the dampness abundant and the patient able to withstand it, then cauterize him on the pubis and cauterize on each flank, and perhaps add two small cauterizations to the stomach near the large one, for it is a successful treatment whose benefit does not fail, God willing.
Chapter thirty-four.
On cauterizing the hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are chronic, numerous, or single hemorrhoids in the anus, and they are from thick, cold humors or corrupt dampness, and they have been treated with what we mentioned in the division but the treatment has not been effective, then cauterize the patient with three cauterizations on the lower part of the sacrum under the table slightly, triangularly.
And a cauterization below the navel by the length of two fingers. And if you judge that his stomach has become cold and his food does not digest, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization as mentioned before, and a cauterization on his liver. And another on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery. And leave the cautery open for a time, then treat him until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery which resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the same cut wart and persevere with your hand until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which the blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we have described, then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal. And if you cauterize it with a large cautery also on cotton, it will be more effective.
Chapter thirty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula which is in the anus and its surroundings.
If the patient does not consent to the incision and the procedure which we described in its place and shrinks from that, then perhaps he will heal by cauterization.  If a fistula occurs and pus and foul moisture flow from it for a long time, then the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then know its depth with the probe, then heat the cautery which resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the fistula itself, along the course of the fistula and the extent to which the probe entered, and repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt tissues are burned, once or twice or three times, according to your need.
And beware of burning a nerve if there is one, or a large vein, and if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine.
Therefore, beware of all these places.  And you do this only if the fistula is in a fleshy place and you estimate that it is not penetrating. Then treat the place until it heals. If the place is sealed and the matter ceases from it and remains so for a time, then know that it has healed completely.
And if the matter does not cease from it, then know that it is penetrating, or that in its depth there is a corrupt bone or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter thirty-seven.
On cauterizing the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or a strong wind, and the patient's sexual function is diminished because of it, then it is necessary to cauterize him on the loins, on the kidneys themselves.  Cauterize each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery mentioned previously; and perhaps you will cauterize a third time in the same place.  So three cauterizations, lined up, will be more effective.
Chapter thirty-eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize him with one cauterization below the navel, on the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and one cauterization to the right of the navel and another to the left.
The cauterization on each side should be the size of a thumb joint, and cauterize one or two times in the lower back if necessary. The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter thirty-nine.
On cauterizing the womb.
If a substance forms in the womb due to cold and dampness, and because of that it prevents conception and its flow is corrupted and its courses are difficult, or pain occurs upon its arrival, then it should be cauterized with three cauterizations around the navel, as we mentioned in cauterizing the bladder. One or two cauterizations on cotton in the lower back, and the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Humoral substances may be attracted to the hip joint, causing it to dislocate.  The sign is that the leg appears longer than the other when comparing them, and you find an empty space at the site of the dislocation.  Therefore, the patient should be cauterized with a semi-circular cauterization on the hip joint itself.
After marking with ink around the joint, in a circular fashion, so that the joint itself falls in the center of the circle, use the cautery whose image is presented in the cauterization of the stomach. If you do not have this cautery, use three cauterizations with the large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cauterization deep enough to reach the entire thickness of the skin, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter forty-one.
On cauterizing sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint, and the cause is cold and dampness, and you have treated the patient as mentioned in the classification, and the treatment has not been effective, and this has lasted for some time, then it is necessary to evacuate the thick humors from the patient with  bitter apple or prickly pear, or something similar.
Then shave it and apply cauterization in two ways: either cauterization with burning drugs or cauterization with fire. Cauterization with fire can be done in many ways; one of them is to cauterize on the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
Make them of a suitable depth, and the distance between each cauterization should be the width of a finger. The cautery iron should be olive-shaped.  You may also cauterize one in the middle on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations. And if you wish, shave it in a circle as previously mentioned in cauterizing a dislocated hip, with a single cauterization.
So that the circle encompasses the entire hip and burns the entire thickness of the skin. This is the manner of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize two cauterizations on the thigh at the place where the patient indicates pain, and one cauterization above the heel, four fingers towards the lateral side slightly. The cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only the thickness of the skin.
If he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize where he indicates with a pointed cautery iron, three or four times, or more if necessary. If he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with one knife-shaped cauterization.
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to burn a nerve or a large artery, lest you cause the patient a bad or lasting harm.
And I have seen one and another who was cauterized above the heel, and the cauterization was excessive, so that the leg became gangrenous until the gangrene reached the foot and perforated it entirely, and the whole leg became corrupted, then diarrhea and death followed.  If the pain is in both sides, cauterize both in the same manner.
Some learned physicians have mentioned for cauterizing the hip a cautery of this description:  A cup-like instrument is made of iron, its diameter half a span, and at its mouth it should be the thickness of a date pit or slightly less, and inside that cup another cup, and a third cup.
And the distance between each cup should be the width of a thumb's joint, and the cups should be open on both sides, and their height about a joint or two joints, and a handle of firmly attached iron is made for them.  And this is its image.
Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, then it is placed on the hip joint, the patient leaning on the sound side, and you cauterize with three round cauterizations at once. Then you leave it for three days, and dress it with butter, and leave the wound open for several days.
Many, then treat it with ointment until it heals. The author of this book said: We have seldom used this type of cautery because of its ugliness and the horror of its appearance, and because few are found who can endure it, except that it is a good cautery for whomever endures it and its location is correctly hit.
As for cauterization with burning medications, it is that you make two cups similar to the rings in which the pulp of the pomegranate is placed, of copper or of iron.
Their rims will have a height of about two finger joints or so, and the distance between them will be the thickness of a finger, and they will be open at the bottom and open at the top, and they will be fastened to each other in this manner.
Then you lower it onto the hip joint, the patient lying on his sound side, and you support your hand firmly, then you pour between the circles some hot water, which is warmed a little by the fire, and hold it for the time of a sandglass, and the patient endures its stinging and burning, for he will feel a burning like fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then you raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the hot water from the whole hip with fresh water, then you leave it for three days and apply butter to it until the blackness of the burn disappears, and you leave it for days so that pus flows from it, for that is more effective.
Then you treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, you make for him a mold to contain the water, according to what you made for the hip, the same. And this is the description of the hot water, and I have already described it in the chapter on the preparation of medicines.
Take of alkali salt and of unslaked lime, one part of each, crush them and place them in a new pot which has been pierced at the bottom with one small hole, just large enough for a stylus to pass through, and place under the bottom of the pot another glazed pot.
And pour over the alkali and lime enough fresh water to cover them by a finger's breadth, after you have pressed them well with your hand, and leave the pot until the hot water descends into the glazed pot below, then collect all that water and pour it onto more fresh lime and alkali.
For then it will be extremely strong and sharp, useful in many medical procedures and in cauterizing various members, because it acts exactly like fire.  Among the medicaments which also cauterize the hip are thapsia, linseed oil, and lime with soap, mixed together.
Galen, recounting the story of an ancient man, claimed a treatment for hip pain and sciatica, greatly praising it and claiming that no other treatment is needed, and that it cures with a single application.
To the point that someone might enter the bath carried and leave cured. This is done by taking green henbane—if green is unavailable, then take fresh dry henbane—finely grinding it with a little fat and applying it to the hip where the pain is, or to the leg or thigh.
It is bound on and left for three hours, or however long the patient feels the burning cease. Then he enters the bath; when his body is damp, he enters the bath pool. Then, God willing, the pain will go away and he will be cured. If he is not cured, repeat the poultice after ten days.
Then, God willing, he will be cured. Know that no one should cauterize with these medicaments except after the body has been purged. Dioscorides mentioned that goat hair, when used to cauterize sciatica, is beneficial.
The cauterization is performed in this manner: wool is taken and soaked in old oil and placed on the hollow place between the thumb and the forearm, closer to the forearm. Then take dry goat hair.
Heat it in the fire until it becomes an ember, then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out. Then take another and continue doing this until sensation reaches from the middle of the upper arm to the hip, and the pain ceases, God willing. This type of cauterization is called cauterization with goat hair.
Chapter forty-two.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Pain in the back may occur from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like.  It may be from the effusion of a cold, moist substance, and cauterization is only done in this type alone.
That which is from the effusion of a cold substance, then after the patient has vomited with hellebore and the like, he should be cauterized on his back where the pain is, three rows across the width of the table itself, after marking the location with ink. In each row, five cauterizations or more, according to what you see of the patient's endurance and strength.
The cauterization should be with a pointed cautery; and if you wish, cauterize it with three or four cauterizations with a medium-sized nail cautery, in this manner.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a hump.
This ailment often affects young children.  The sign of its beginning in the child is that shortness of breath occurs upon standing and movement, and you will find at the end of the vertebrae of his back a bead that has protruded, standing out from the other beads.
If you see that and wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery, in this manner. Let the cautery take hold on each side of the vertebra equally. And if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery, in two or three rows, and let the points be close to one another.  Then treat the area until it heals, as we have mentioned.
And be careful not to use cautery in a hump that is from a spasm of the nerve.
Chapter forty-four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are from cold humors that descend to any member of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, then it is customary for physicians to call that gout, especially.
If gout caused by cold is treated with the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification and the pains do not go away, then cauterization will remove them. This is done by cauterizing, after evacuation, around the joint of the legs with many cauterizations.  The cautery should be olive-shaped and medium-sized, in this manner.
And if you need to punctuate the surface of the leg, do so with a punctate cautery. If the pains ascend to the knees or to other joints—and this frequently happens—cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery.
If you need more cauterization than this, cauterize, but do not deepen your hand with the cautery; rather, let it be about the thickness of the skin only. If the pains ascend to the hips or to the back, then use what we mentioned concerning cauterization in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, punctuate around the forearms as if encircling two rows. If the pains remain in the fingers, punctuate each joint with a point and the metacarpus. If the pains ascend after several days to the elbows or to the shoulders,
cauterize them on each side. The patient should not lack good management and the taking of medicines; for if he improves his diet and evacuates phlegm, he will be cured with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the cauterization of fissures.
If a hernia appears in the groin and some of the intestine and fat descends to the testicle, and this is recent and beginning, then you should order the patient to abstain from food that day and to use laxatives to evacuate his bowels.
Then he should lie on his back before you, and you should tell him to restrain himself until the fat or intestine protrudes, then you should return it with your finger, then you should mark with ink below the hernia on the pubic bone a mark resembling a semicircle, its extremities towards the upper part of the body.
Then heat a cautery of this shape.
Until it becomes white and throws off sparks, then return the intestine or fat to the abdomen. Then a servant should place his hand on the place lest the intestine protrude, and you have spread the patient's legs and placed a pillow under him, and another servant should tie his legs.
And another on his chest holding his hands. Then you lower the cautery onto the same mark, and your hand with the cautery should be upright and straight, and hold it until it reaches the bone, or repeat it again if it does not reach the bone the first time.
And guard against the protrusion of the intestine while cauterizing, lest you burn it, which would cause the patient either death or a great calamity. And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed. And the cautery for children should be gentle according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with butter until the scab from the fire disappears, then treat it with other ointments until it heals. And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is closed.
And you should make his food during his treatment such as softens his bowels, lest the intestine protrude during straining and defecation. Then, when he wishes to get up after forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days, and let him reduce exertion and fullness from food and drink and loud shouting.
For if this treatment is used in this way, he will heal completely, God willing. And I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing.  And as for the hernia which occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is incipient, if you wish it not to increase, cauterize a round mark on it according to its size. Let what you burn of the skin be about two-thirds of it, then treat it as we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing. And some of the ancients mentioned that the hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After you mark the hernia with ink, making the horizontal line at the upper side of the hernia and the other line downwards, and you make one nail-sized cauterization in the middle; the first cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter forty-six.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If pain occurs in some member from a fall or a blow, and that pain lasts a long time, and medication does not alleviate it, then it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery.  The cauterization of each member should be according to its size, whether small or large, and its weakness or strength.
And if the pain and fistula persist, then if it heals from the first cauterization, that is good; otherwise repeat the cauterization. For it is the habit of these pains to move from one member to what is near it; therefore you should follow them with cauterization until the patient is healed.
Chapter forty-seven.
On cauterizing leprosy.
As for lepers, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize, look: if the leprosy is beginning, and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the classification, and it has not subsided nor stopped, and you fear that corruption will seize the whole temperament of the patient, then cauterize on the head five cauterizations. One in the usual middle of the head, the second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two on the temples, and one from behind on the hollow of the nape; and prolong your hand with the cautery a little until it affects the bone slightly.
And scales will be removed from it so that the thick vapors may easily escape from it.  And cauterize also on the spleen itself as before. But if the leprosy has continued on the patient and appeared clearly, then it is necessary to cauterize these cauterizations which we mentioned on the head. And a cauterization on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on the cheeks, and two cauterizations on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and a large one on the coccyx at the end of the spine, and another above it in the same region, and two on the hips, one on each hip. And two on the knees, one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the breasts, and cauterize on each joint of the joints of his fingers and toes, one cauterization, and on each heel of his feet and forearms.
And beware of the nerve which is on the back of the heels lest you burn them. And perhaps a cauterization may be made on the pubic bone, and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver. And know that the more you increase the cauterization, the more useful and effective it will be.
And know that the patient does not feel pain from the cauterization as the healthy person does, because his body is numb.  And the cauteries should be of various sizes, large and small, according to the limbs and joints, as was previously described concerning the characteristics of the cauteries.
Then treat the cauterization with finely ground cress mixed with honey and other treatments until it heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-eight.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness: when a limb becomes numb and is treated with medications, ointments, and bandages but does not heal, cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the limb, whether large or small. Let your cauterization be deep, penetrating slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  And it may be that some numbness affecting the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb, is cauterized, and the numbness will disappear.
And let none undertake this except one who is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter forty-nine.
Concerning the cauterization of vitiligo.
If vitiligo is longstanding and no medical treatment is effective, cauterize it slightly, to the depth of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil, and the leaves of verbascum, and pigeon's blood or the blood of sparrows; one part of each. Mix everything together, apply it to a cloth, and bind it to the place until it heals.
Chapter fifty.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is incipient and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it grows. Some wise men have mentioned that it should be cauterized strongly in its middle; I do not see that, because I expect it to ulcerate, and I have witnessed that many times.
The correct thing is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we said, or with many cauterizations.
Chapter fifty-one.
Concerning the cauterization of hemorrhoids.
If a hemorrhoid occurs and is slow to mature, either because of the strength of the agent that causes it, or because of the age of the patient if he is old and anemic, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the hemorrhoid, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations in a punctate manner.
Then leave it, for it will hasten maturation. If you want to stop it with cauterization, take the cautery iron, the image of which is this.
And insert it into the middle of the hemorrhoid until it penetrates the skin. Let the cauterization be from what is below, so that the pus may flow easily. Then treat it as appropriate until it heals.
Chapter fifty-two.
On cauterizing the canker.
A canker is a corruption that spreads in the member and consumes it, just as fire consumes dry wood. If you see a canker in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, take many small and large, nail-like cauteries, according to what is suitable for that place where the canker is.
Then cauterize it from every direction until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing of it remains at all. Then leave it for three days and apply to the cauterized areas powdered sulfur with oil until all the eschar and all the corruption is removed.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh. If after three days you see that the flesh grows healthy and without corruption, then do nothing. Otherwise repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupted areas.  The canker may also be treated with a sharp medicine.
For it acts in place of fire, more quickly beneficial. I have mentioned its treatment with a sharp medicine in the classification; take it from there when you need it.
Chapter fifty-three.
On the cauterization of inverted and non-inverted nails.
This condition frequently occurs on the soles of the feet; it is a rough thing that pains the person.  Cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a sharp liquid.
As for cauterization with fire, you heat a hollow cautery iron resembling an eagle's feather, made of iron, to a size that encompasses the nail on all sides. It should have a thin edge. Then you place it, hot, upon the nail, and then rotate your hand with the cautery iron around the nail until the cautery iron reaches the depth of the nail.
Leave it for three days, during which pus will form. Then dress it with pounded wild rue mixed with salt and leave the dressing on it overnight. Then it will be removed from its roots.  Then treat the wound site with a flesh-producing ointment until it heals, if the nails are not inverted.
This frequently occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet.  You should take a tube of copper, iron, or an eagle's feather and place it over the nail or wart, then pour a small amount of sharp liquid into the tube.
Hold your hand while rotating it, gently probing with your hand so that the edge of the tube affects the root of the nail, and the sharp liquid finds its way to the root of the nail. The patient should endure the stinging of the sharp liquid for a short time.
Then leave it, for the nail will be removed from its roots. Do this one by one until you have treated all of them on the body. Then treat the areas after they are removed with ointments that promote flesh growth.
Chapter fifty-four.
On cauterizing scabs.
If a scab occurs from a cold in the nerve or from a quartan fever or something else, it should be cauterized four or five times on the spine, with a cauterization between each vertebra, and one cauterization on the chest. And a cauterization on his stomach with an olive-shaped cautery iron, for the scab will subside and the cold illness will ripen quickly.
Chapter fifty-five.
On cauterizing pustules occurring on the body.
Ugly pustules may erupt on the body, resulting from cold, thick, corrupt substances. At their first appearance, each pustule should be gently cauterized with a cautery iron, the tip of which has been heated in the fire, or with a long cautery iron, or with a lenticular cautery iron.
And boils may be cauterized in this manner at their first eruption, so that their active principle does not increase, and the patient recovers from them; however, this should be done after the patient has been bled.
Chapter fifty-six.
On cauterizing hemorrhage occurring from a severed artery.
Hemorrhage often occurs from a severed artery during a wound inflicted from outside, or when incising a tumor, or cauterizing a member, and so on, and it is difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the mouth of the artery and press it firmly so that the blood is contained under your finger and none comes out. Then place several small and large olive-shaped cautery irons in the fire and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has burst, and apply the cautery iron to the same vein after quickly removing your finger, and hold the cautery iron until the bleeding stops.
If, when you remove your finger from the mouth of the artery, the bleeding resumes and the cautery iron is extinguished, quickly take another cautery iron from those prepared in the fire and continue to do this one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve that is there, lest another affliction befall the patient. And know that if blood flows from an artery, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except in one of four ways: either by cautery, as we said; or by amputation if it has not already been severed; for if it is severed, its ends contract and the bleeding stops; or it may be tightly bound with threads; or medicines that stop bleeding may be applied to it, and it may be firmly bandaged with a compress.
And as for anyone who tries to stop it with a ligature or by tightening with cloths or by applying cauterizing substances and the like, it will not be stopped at all except rarely.  If this happens to someone and a physician or medicine is not available, let him quickly place the index finger on the mouth of the wound itself as we described.
And let him press it very hard until the blood is contained and flows from above the wound and onto the artery, and the finger should not be removed from it, constantly using very cold water until the blood clots, thickens, and stops.  In the meantime, consider what may be needed in the way of cautery or medicine.
Chapter Two.
Concerning incisions, punctures, bloodletting, wounds, and the like.
Khalaf said: In the first chapter we mentioned every disease suitable for cauterization with fire and cauterizing medicine, and its causes, reasons, instruments, types of cautery irons, and I made that into sections from the head to the foot.
And I follow in this chapter the same method, to make it easier for the student to obtain what he seeks.
Before I begin with that, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains more pitfalls than the first chapter on cautery.
And because of that, warning should be stronger in this, because the work in this chapter often involves the loss of blood which sustains life when opening a vein, or incising a tumor, or lancing an abscess, or treating a wound, or removing an arrow, or incising a stone, and the like, all of which involve danger and fear, and in most of them, death results.
And I advise you against engaging in what is doubtful to you, for there may come to you in this craft various kinds of people with various kinds of illnesses, some of whom are weary of their illness and death is easy for them.
Because of the severity of what he feels from his illness and the length of his affliction, and the illness is established in a way that indicates death. And some will give you their money and enrich you with it hoping for health, and his illness is fatal. So you should not accept at all those who come to you with this description.
Let your caution be stronger than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with anything of that unless after certain knowledge is established with you about what leads to a good outcome.  And use in all the treatment of your patients a foreknowledge and warning of what leads to safety.
For in that you have help in acquiring praise, glory, mention and thanks. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance and not deprive you of correctness and success. Indeed, that is in His hand. There is no god but He.
And I have arranged this chapter in sections, as preceded in the chapter on cauterization, from head to foot, so that what you want from it may be easier for you, God willing.
The first section.
In the treatment of the water that collects in the heads of children.
This ailment often affects children at birth if the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness, and it may also occur from a hidden cause that is not known.
And I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than children, and all of them whom I have seen have quickly approached death; therefore I have seen [it best] to leave working on it. And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day. Until the child could not sit up because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture either gathers between the skin and the bone, or it gathers under the bone on the membrane.  The procedure in this case, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, is that one should make an incision in the middle of the head, a single transverse incision, the length of the incision being about two fingerbreadths, so that the moisture flows out.  This is the image of the scalpel.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling is larger, then make two intersecting incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is under the bone—and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side, and the water subsides if you press it with your hand inwards, and this is not hidden from you—then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner.
After the incision, all the moisture comes out, then you bind the incisions with cloths and bandages. Then you dress it from above with a drink and oil until the fifth day. Then you untie the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments. Do not neglect to bind the head moderately, and feed the patient with all dry food, low in moisture.
Until the member strengthens and heals. Another description of the incision is that you look where the bone of the swelling and the gathering of water appear, for it may be more in the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
Then you aim with the incision where the swelling and the fullness of water appear to you, so you incise it as much as you can, and be careful not to cut an artery, lest bleeding occur and the patient die from that bleeding along with the evacuation of the moisture.
Chapter Two.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears known as the "al-ḥasīsayn".
When someone suffers from acute attacks in the eyes or chest, and this persists and treatment with medications does not work, then the best treatment in that is to cut these two arteries.
Then, if you wish to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to reveal the artery, then tighten the patient's neck with the excess of his garment, then look where the pulse beats and their locations, the two low-lying locations behind the ears, and they rarely hide except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with a sharp scalpel, cutting to the bone. This should be done across the head, and if you wish, insert the scalpel from under the artery and cut upwards. The length of the cut should be about two joined fingers.
If the artery is cut, the blood will come out in a pulsating manner, leaping forward and throbbing continuously. If the artery is not felt, you should measure three fingers from the ear, then mark it with ink and incise to the bone.  What should be...
…sent from the blood six ounces on average, and perhaps more or less will be sent, all according to the strength of the patient and the fullness of his arteries that appears to you. Then look at the wound; if there remains anything of the peritoneum on the bone, cut it.
Lest a hot swelling appear, then bind the wound with a thread of linen cloth, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
In ligating the two arteries in the temples.
If a person experiences chronic migraine or acute attacks due to sharp humors and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headache and the like, and he was treated with various medical treatments which did not work, then we have tried in these diseases ligating the arteries of the temples or cauterizing them as we have described.
And the method of ligating them is that the patient should have the hair shaved from the temples, and aim for the artery apparent in the temple, for it will be evident to you from its pulsation, and it rarely hides except in a few people.
Or, in case of intense cold, if it is hidden from you, let the patient tighten his neck with the excess of his garment, then you rub the area with a cloth or compress the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly and evidently. Then take the scalpel, whose picture is this. Then you incise the skin gently with it until you reach the artery, then you cast a hook into it and pull it upwards until you bring it out of the skin and free it from the membranes underneath it from every side; if the artery is thin, then twist it with the end of the hook. Then cut a portion from it to the extent that its ends are separated and constricted and do not cause bleeding; for if it is not severed and cut off, the blood will not flow at all.  Then evacuate from six ounces to three of blood.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread; and let the thread be either of silk or of lute strings, lest decay quickly reach it before the wound heals, causing bleeding.
Then cut what is between the ligatures; do this at that time or after another time. And if you wish to cauterize it with a knife-like cautery to the bone until its ends are severed, this will take the place of this very action, or better, as we said.
Unless the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, for cauterization is among the things that help to consume the humors, so it is more certain in its benefit.  After removing the arteries, it is necessary that the place be packed with old cotton and firm bandages be applied; after healing, treat it with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow and with lint, until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your work, hasten to cut it off, either by cauterization, or by filling the area with vitriol and tightening your hand until the blood stops. If you do not have any of that, put your finger there until the blood clots.
And wash the area with very cold water until the sharpness subsides, and bind it as necessary.  And what is easier and simpler than ligating the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after you mark the two places with ink.
And bring it down very hot until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed in two places so that what is between its ends is separated, for it will not reunite with this cauterization at all. And this is the image of the cautery.
The blades should be sharp, resembling small scalpels, except that they should be much less sharp than a scalpel, because if they are as sharp as a scalpel, they will cool more quickly and the flesh will not be severed quickly. If there is some thickness to them, the heat of the fire will be retained in them.
And it cuts the flesh quickly. This method is better than any other method, and it is easier and simpler.  Let the distance between the blades be about the width of a finger.
Chapter Four.
In the treatment of the constant flow of hot tears into the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the veins on the scalp from the outside, and nothing from medical treatment with drugs has benefited, and you see the patient's face is red. And he feels a crawling sensation in his forehead like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are sunken and moist, his eyelids are eroded, and his eyelids are clinging together from the intensity of the tears.  Therefore, the ancients in treating it resorted to this procedure, and they call it treatment with the sword. It is that you order the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then you make three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead. The length of each incision is about two fingers, one incision parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second a little distance from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third from the other side.
And be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from the joining of the jaws.  Let the distance after each incision be about three closed fingers. And let you have prepared pieces of sponge or many dry cloths to wipe away the blood.
Then insert the double-edged scalpel, whose image is this. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, and with it, you should separate all the skin between the incisions along with the membrane on the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision to the third incision. Then remove this scalpel. And also insert into the first incision another instrument called a sharp, one-sided scalpel, smooth and not sharp on the other side. And this is its image:
And place its sharp side upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone. And push it until you reach the middle incision, and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do this in the middle incision to the other incision.  After a moderate amount of blood flows, press the areas of clotted blood. Then place in each incision a cotton wick and place over it a dressing moistened with a syrup and oil, or vinegar and oil.
So that no hot swelling occurs. On the third day, remove the bandage and use plenty of washing with lukewarm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and whatever you treat wounds with until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from the interior of the head.
When someone experiences many severe, sharp, persistent discharges, and you see his eyes weak, small, and his vision weakened, and his eyelids ulcerated and shedding their skin. And there is severe, painful pain in the depth of the head and consecutive sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins, and the best treatment is this treatment, which is that you order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is severe, painful pain in the depth of the head and consecutive sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins, and the best treatment is this treatment, which is that you order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or a little higher across, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and the incision should be to the bone, and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples which move when chewing, until when the bone is uncovered and all the blood is dried with a sponge.
Then separate the edges of the incision with old cotton or a linen thread, then bandage from above with compresses, and soak the compresses with syrup and oil lest a hot swelling occurs. And when you untie them and see that the hot swelling has subsided, then you should scrape the bone until the growth of flesh begins in it.
Then treat it with a drying preparation that grows flesh, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and preparing an ointment from them, and using it in the growth of flesh in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or a semi-stone like iron and glass; or a vegetable seed like chickpea and kernel and the like; or a flowing thing like water and vinegar and the like.
Or an animal.  When a stone or a kind of stone falls into the ear which does not grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun. Then if you see the stone, instill some violet oil or cerate into it, then try to remove it by movement of the head or sneezing with hellebore. And close the nostrils at the onset of sneezing after you place a ring of rags or wool around the ear and extend the ear upward. Often it comes out with this treatment. If it does not come out otherwise, then try to remove it with a gentle probe, whose image is this.
If it comes out with the probe, otherwise try to remove it with a fine, slightly curved, blind hook. If it does not come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the hole of the ear gently.
And seal what is around the tube with pitch softened with oil, lest there be a way for the air other than the tube. Then draw it with your breath strongly, and often it comes out with that. If it does not come out with what we described, then take a little of the gum of Nabataea or of the prepared gum which is taken by birds, place it on the tip of a probe.
After wrapping a tightly-wound cotton around it, then insert it into the hole of the ear gently after you have dried the ear from moisture. If it does not come out by all that we described, then proceed to incision before the hot inflammation or spasm occurs.
The description of the incision is that you first bleed the patient in the cephalic vein and remove blood from him according to his strength. Then you seat the patient before you, turn his ear upward, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near its lobe in the lower part of it.
And let the incision be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instruments you can. Then quickly stitch the incision and treat it until it heals.
And if the thing that fell into the ear is one of the seeds that grow and swell, then try to remove it with what we mentioned. If it does not respond to removal, then take a thin, delicate scalpel in this manner.
And try with it to cut that type of seed that fell into the ear. You only do this if you are certain that that seed has become moistened by the vapor of the ear until it becomes many small pieces, then remove them with a blind probe or with a soft swab or by suction.
As we mentioned, then it is easy to remove them. As for the water that enters the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with hellebore, having filled his ear with some old cotton while lying down on the ear in which is the water. If it comes out with that,
otherwise, take many small, smooth, flat stones along the length of the fingers, warm them slightly with fire, and the patient puts one of them into the hole of his ear and stands on one leg on that side and strikes the stone in the ear with another stone.
He continues to do this with one stone after another until all the water comes out.  The water may also come out by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather and inserting one end into the ear, and bringing the other end to the fire until most of it burns, then repeating with another feather.
Do this repeatedly until all the water comes out or draw it out with a tube as was mentioned previously with the stone. As for removing a creature that has entered it, look: if it is small in body like a flea or similar, treat it as mentioned in the classification, but...
if its body is large and perceptible to the touch, try to remove it with forceps and hooks; this is easier than anything else that becomes lodged in the ear. As for removing worms that develop in the ear, if you treat it as mentioned in the classification in the chapter on fumigations and your treatment is not effective,
you should look into the ear in the sun; if you see anything of the worms, remove them with forceps or delicate hooks. If you do not see anything, take a tube of this shape.
narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, and insert the thin end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate. Then suck strongly with it; do this repeatedly until all the worms come out. If they do not respond to this, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned to you with the stone.
If they do not come out by what we have mentioned, use the fumigations which I have mentioned, and which the ancients have tried in killing worms; you will find this in the chapter on fumigations.  Pouring oils and medicines into the ear is done with this instrument, and this is its image:
As you see, make it of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, wide at the top. If you wish, let the nozzle inside the tube be of tightly fitting copper; if you wish, take a reed and wrap cotton tightly around its end.
Then pour the oil or juice or whatever medicine you want into the tube while it is in the ear, then insert the reed with the cotton from above and squeeze it moderately with your hand until the oil is driven into the interior of the ear and is felt.
The patient feels it entering. And let what you pour into the ear be warmed a little in the fire, and beware that what is instilled is neither too cold nor too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
In the treatment of obstruction occurring in the ear.
Some children may be born with their ear openings not perforated.
Obstruction in the ear canal may also occur in some people from a wound or from  flesh growing there; and this obstruction may be deep within the ear opening, beyond sight.
It may also appear slightly outside the opening and be visible; that which appears deep within the ear and is not visible is in most cases difficult to cure, and that which is visible, the patient's ear should be placed in the sun. And look into it; if you see the obstruction apparent, open it with a delicate scalpel, which has this shape:
Its tip should be somewhat broad, limited on one side, and the rest of the scalpel smooth on both sides so that it does not injure the ear; if the obstruction is from flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate hook and cut it gently and thoroughly until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep in the ear, take a smooth, slender probe, warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal; if you feel the obstruction, along with the patient's feeling of heaviness in hearing, gently remove it.
And be careful not to injure the membrane of the ear, then insert into the ear a wick the size of the opening, which you have dipped in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure the wound has healed, or take a wick, moisten it with water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it.
And use it; if you see that the ear has swollen with a hot swelling, it is necessary to remove the wick and replace it with another wick dipped in prepared quince, made with rose oil, until the hot swelling subsides, then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear, and use the other treatments that stop bleeding, mentioned in the chapter on cauterizations.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts which appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry; it is necessary to grasp them with forceps or a hook and cut them from their roots with a scalpel, then apply powdered verdigris to the area.
If it bleeds, cauterize it with a gentle lentil-shaped cautery; cauterization is better after cutting.  It often returns if anything remains of its roots; if it is cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and it does not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of the cold affecting the eyelids.
Often something resembling a cold in its intensity and hardness appears in the eyelids.
Therefore it is called a cold, and it is a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The procedure is that you should look; if the cold is prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves to every direction, then its treatment is easy; make a transverse incision on it.
Then gently peel it from every side until it is freed, then hang it with a hook and cut it. If it is not possible for you to cut it except after you have perforated the eyelid with the cut, this does not harm the patient at all. If the incision is large, then join it with sutures and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, then there is no harm from it, for the ointment will heal and join it. If the cold is inclined towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid and hang the cold with a hook without needing to make an incision, and cut it from every side.
If it perforates the eyelid with the cut, that does not harm anything. Then wash the eye after cutting the cold with salt water and treat the area with something that joins it until the patient heals.
Chapter Ten.
In the treatment of the growth that appears in the eyelid.
The growth is a fleshy excrescence that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid. This mostly affects children; it weighs down their eyes, causing them to suffer from colds at night, and they are unable to look at sunlight. Because the tears flow quickly to them.
Therefore, you see them always leaning on their faces, and sleeping on them, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, swollen, and the growth is clearly visible.  When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the growth between them. The procedure is to have the patient place his head in your lap.
Then you take a linen cloth, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick, large enough to surround the growth on all sides. Then you place it on the growth and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the growth in the center of the circle.
Then you make a transverse incision in the middle of that swelling with a lancet, and the incision should not be larger than an incision made in bloodletting. As for depth, you should cut through all the skin until you reach the growth.
In most cases, the growth protrudes from the incision as a piece of white fat. You pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your fingers, rotating your hand right and left until it is removed. Beware of enlarging the incision, lest the lancet reach the eye and injure it.
If the growth does not appear in the first incision, you should gently enlarge the incision a little until the growth appears. Then pull it out as we said, then dip cloths in vinegar and water and apply them to the area and bind it with a bandage. Some people crush salt.
And they place it inside the incision to dissolve what remains of that swelling. Then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On types of eyelid tumors.
If excessive membranes grow on the eyelid, contrary to the natural course, beneath the natural membranes and eyelashes, then they harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, whiteness, and thickening, to the point that this causes blindness.
Eye tumors are of four types: cauterization with fire, application of a strong medicine as previously described in the chapter on cauterization, excision and suturing, or treatment with reeds, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand; if it does not turn, then insert a needle threaded with a suture from beneath the eyelid, passing the needle and thread from above, near the hair itself, and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid.
Turn it with a probe, then incise the inner eyelid below the excess hair with a sharp scalpel, from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus. Then remove the suture, place a small pledget of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and mark the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of a laurel leaf, except that the shape should be according to the amount of eyelid elevation you desire, for this varies among people; some may require a suitable amount of eyelid to be cut off according to the degree of eyelid relaxation.
Some may need less to be cut, all this according to the relaxation of the eyelid. Then, incise with the scalpel along the two lines you marked, beginning from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, each incision being near the natural hair, about the thickness of a probe.
Then insert the hook into one corner of the skin and remove it all. Then, using a needle and fine woolen thread, suture the edges together. Wipe away the blood and fasten the remaining threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive substance.
If you wish to do so, otherwise it does not matter.  Then leave the sutures and threads in place for about three or four days, then treat it.  If you wish, you may leave the wound without suturing and treat it with drying and astringent substances, for the eyelid will rise when the wound heals and unites; however, suturing is better.
This method of blepharoplasty was mentioned by the ancients, although it is burdensome for the patient; it is, however, a good procedure and without danger.  Another method of blepharoplasty is to mark a shape on the eyelid like a laurel leaf, as we described. Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or grouped in this manner:
Then cut away the excess eyelid with small scissors, evenly, in this manner:
If you cannot hold the hooks steady, take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger canthus and a third thread near the smaller canthus.  Gather the threads evenly between your fingers, then raise them gently.
Raise all of the marked skin as described, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If hot inflammation occurs when you cut or incise, treat this inflammation with qirūṭī or similar emollient ointments.
The lower eyelid may also have its edges inverted; in this case, you should use what we mentioned: cutting, suturing, cauterization with fire, and application of a caustic medicine. Cauterization with fire or caustic medicine is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and suturing; use cutting and suturing as necessary.
Cauterization with reeds is done in this manner: invert the eyelid and make an incision on the inside as described. Then make two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length equal to the length of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
And you should trim their ends on both sides where the threads are attached. Then gently bring them together over what remains of the eyelid and firmly tie the two reeds on both sides, and leave it for some days. The tightened skin then dies, turns black, and sloughs away.
Until it falls off by itself; if it is slow to fall off, trim it with scissors, then treat it until it heals. When it is healed the eyelid will be raised and the eyelashes will not be inverted. This is an image of the two reeds, showing how they are made in terms of this shape and size in length and width.
Chapter Twelve.
On raising inverted eyelashes from the eye with a needle.
If there is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a fine needle and thread it with fine, smooth silk, then bring the ends together and tie a very small knot. The length of the thread should be about a span.
Then attach another fine thread to the loop, shorter than the first, and tie its ends if you wish. Then have the patient place his head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the work may be clear, for it is delicate work. Then insert the needle with the loop into the root of the superfluous hair.
And quickly pass it through the eyelid until you bring it out above the natural hair. Then pull the thread up through the loop and draw the hair or hairs into the loop—not more than three.
Then pull it with your hand until the hair comes out with the loop in the eyelid along with the natural hair. If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, pull the loop downwards with the thread you attached to it until the loop comes out from the upper hole.
Then return the hair into it and pull them; do this until it rises in the upper hole and you see it clearly. Then remove the loop and the thread and take them out, and bind the eye and leave it bound for two or three days until the hair settles in its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add a long hair from the natural hair to it so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer, then raise it.
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of the sty that occurs in the upper eyelid.
That which this sty is exposed to is called a harelip, and this sty is either natural or accidental. The accidental one is from the healing of a wound or a cut or cautery and the like.
And the method of treatment is to incise that adhesion and separate its lips and put a linen wick between them and bind it until it heals, and it is not advisable to use things that dry and constrict in its treatment.
For if you do that, the sty will return more severely than it was, but use things that relax, such as fenugreek and lint with water in which althea and flaxseed have been boiled, and diachylon ointment melted with something of fats, and smear the wick with it and treat it with it.
And the key to its treatment is to try by every means not to reunite in the way it was at first, and this treatment which we have mentioned is only some improvement of the sty, not that the appearance of the place returns exactly as it was at all.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the treatment of the sty which occurs in the lower eyelid.
This sty which forms in the lower eyelid is that which is truly called a sty, and it is natural and it is accidental.  The accidental one is from a wound or incision or cauterization and the like.
And the method of working in it is that you take a needle with doubled thread and pierce it into the flesh and pass it from the left canthus to the right canthus until the thread is at both ends of the flesh, then you stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to what is proper, otherwise you take a probe and place it on the site of the incision and turn the eyelid with it and make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, and the ends of the incisions are from the corners of the cut which you cut until they meet so that an angle is formed from them. Until when they meet, its shape becomes similar to this shape:
Which is the Greek letter lambda, then you remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp side is below what is next to the eyelid, then you gather the separated parts with two stitches, sewing it with a wool thread, then you treat it with what we mentioned of the relaxing and softening medicines until it heals.
And if the fistula appeared from an incision, suture, or cauterization, it is necessary to make a simple incision without the hair of the labia as well, as previously mentioned, then separate between the lips with a probe as we mentioned.
In short, in the treatment of fistula, whether from above or below, you should perform the procedure according to what is apparent to you of the appearance of the fistula, for it may differ greatly in form, and the skillful surgeon devises a solution in whatever way is possible for him.
Until the shape returns to its natural form or approximates it, and the disease itself indicates the appropriate procedure and instrument in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may occur to many people, such that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing it from easy movement and hindering its natural functions; it is necessary to insert the end of a probe under the eyelid.
And raise it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a delicate scalpel, not sharp like cutting scalpels but rather somewhat blunt, lest the patient be disturbed during the procedure and the scalpel slip, injuring the eye with its sharpness; and your cutting should be as if you are peeling off that adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely healed; then pour into the eye salt water to wash it, or instill into it a solution of vitriol dissolved in water, then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen wick.
And place on top of the eye wool moistened with egg white, and after the third day use the astringent eye drops until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cutting the pterygium and the fleshy excrescence of the conjunctiva.
The pterygium is of two types: either nervous, resembling a thin, hard membrane, or non-nervous, resembling a thick white moisture which, if touched by iron or attempted to be grasped with a hook, is torn.
And a hook has not been fixed in it. Both types begin from the greater canthus until they gradually spread until they cover the pupil and obstruct light and movement of the eye. The procedure for cutting it is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then you grasp the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and stretch it upwards, then you take a needle and thread it with a horsehair or oxhair and strong thread, and you bend the point of the needle slightly and pierce it into the middle of the pterygium.
And you pass it through with the needle and tie the pterygium with the thread and stretch it upwards and dissect with the hair the side of the pterygium next to the pupil, as if you are spreading it with the hair to its end, then you cut the remainder at the root of the canthus with a fine scalpel or small scissors and leave the natural flesh of the canthus.
So that continuous tearing does not result from its cutting.  The pterygium may be stretched with the hook alone or with the thread as we said, then the smooth-edged scalpel, whose image is this, is used to dissect.
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, lest it cause a wound and injure the pupil. Then, after cutting, put some powdered salt or vitriol into the eye and leave it until the next day, then treat it as is appropriate until it heals.
If the pterygium is not fibrous and you are unable to insert a needle into it or attach a hook to it, this type of pterygium is often treated with medication and heals as described in the classification. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, like this image:. And gently scrape the pterygium from above with it. If you see that it is loosening and crumbling and the scraping has affected it, then instill into the eye some vitriol, or red vitriol, or powdered salt from your case, and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone, unless a hot inflammation intervenes in the eye; then leave it and treat the hot inflammation until it heals, then resume the procedure of scraping until it heals. As for the fleshy excrescence of the canthus…
If the excrescence causes excessive harm to the eye, then hook that excrescence with a hook and cut some of it off; do not cut too deeply, lest it cause a flow of tears. Then instill red or white vitriol into the canthus until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
Concerning the excision of warts and the removal of excess flesh that grows in the eye.
In the eyes of some people, a red, superimposed flesh may grow until it covers the pupil, or comes close to it, or overflows onto the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids may turn outward, and it resembles a rose.
The procedure is that the patient should place his head in your lap, then open his eyes, and you should grasp all that red flesh with hooks suitable for that purpose.
Or grasp it with forceps or tweezers, then cut the flesh little by little until you remove it all by cutting. Be careful of the eye so as not to injure it during the procedure, and your cutting should be either with the scalpel we described for cutting the membrane or with small scissors. Like those with which one plucks hairs, as its image will follow in the chapter which follows this chapter.
When you have finished cutting and all the growth is gone, fill the eye with powdered salt, or drop into it some collyrium or similar caustic medication, and apply externally to the eye cotton soaked in egg white to prevent inflammation.
If some of the growth remains and the bleeding overcomes you and you fear inflammation, leave the eye and treat it with what reduces inflammation, then return to the procedure until it heals.  Do the same with excessive flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any eye weak by nature or by circumstance with cautery, and do not undertake any of these operations until you see that the organ can tolerate the procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
Concerning the removal of foreign bodies from the eye.
Pterygia are red vessels that grow over the eye, preventing vision and weakening the eye over time.  First, you should observe; if the eye in which the pterygia are present is strong and has no other disease besides the pterygia,
then removal is indicated. You should instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, then you should hook those vessels with one or two hooks, according to your skill. The hooks should be delicately curved in this manner:
Or they may be two double hooks in one piece, in this manner:
Then, with a delicate scissors, gently remove those vessels, wiping away the blood from time to time until you see that the vessels have been removed from the eye and the bleeding has stopped. Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors, and perform this procedure midday, facing the sun.
Be very careful in your work so that you do not cut anything other than those vessels. When you have finished, instill green or red vitriol into the eye to cauterize any remaining pterygium. If you are unable to remove it all at that time, dress the eye with something to soothe the pain.
Leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and the inflammation ceases, then repeat the procedure in the same manner until it heals.  This is the image of the appropriate scissors.
Leave it [and let the patient's head be in the student's lap, while another wipes away tears and examines the front and back of the eye, and you] the essential thing in this operation is that you open the eye with a fixed or triangular speculum held by a student.
Sharp, and let the patient's head be in the student's lap, while another wipes away tears and examines the front and back of the eye, and you have the choice of beginning to remove it from the top or bottom of the eye, but it is preferable to remove two strands at the upper margin, one at the end of the eyebrow and the other at its beginning.
Grasp it between the middle and index fingers, then hook it from below opposite them, then grasp it between the little and ring fingers, and lift your hand gently until you see all of the pterygium elevated. Cut it from its thinnest part, if you wish, with scissors or, if you wish, with a fine scalpel.
And you introduce the thread onto a needle and you lift all of the pterygium until it is raised above the conjunctiva, and do not cut the threads, for the tears and blood will obscure your view.
Then cut with scissors what extends beyond the cornea from above and below, so that nothing remains attached except to the cornea.  If you can lift it from the cornea by pulling the thread, that is best, and this may be possible in some people.
And when you have cut it, let its place be cauterized for a few days until its pain subsides and the hot swelling is safe, then resume treatment.
Chapter Nineteen.
On returning the nose to its place.
Physicians call a deviated nose a polypus. If you treat it with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine as described above and it does not heal, there is no remedy except to incise the swelling when it is ripe and extract all the moisture or pus within it.
Until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, remove it with an instrument of this shape:
The rasp, which is made of Indian iron, is called the head. Its head is round like a button, finely engraved with the pattern of a file or a rasp. You place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then turn it between your fingers, applying slight pressure with your hand, until you know that the corruption has been removed.
Do this several times, then dress the wound with drying, astringent medicines. If the wound closes and flesh grows over it, and the discharge stops, and forty days pass without recurrence, suppuration, or any incident,
know that it is healed. Otherwise, there is no remedy except to return the fistula to the nasal opening in this way:  Expose the bone again with an instrument or a sharp medicine. When the bone is exposed, take a probe of this shape:
The point of the instrument is triangular, and its shaft is conical, tapering to the point, as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, near the ethmoid and slightly away from the eye. Then rotate the probe with your hand until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
He will feel air escaping from it if he holds his hand over his nose. Then dress the wound with the drying astringent medicines as I have taught you. If flesh grows and the area hardens, then the matter that was discharging outwards will return to the nose, which will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
In returning the protrusion of the eye.
If the eye protrudes entirely, and no damage or deficiency occurs in the vision, then you should bleed the patient, and then apply cupping to the back of the head without any condition, and perform gentle suction.
Then apply a poultice made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and  bdellium. Then bandage the eye from above with many soft pledgets.  The method for making the pledgets is to take many soft rags and fold each one into four layers, making many of them.
Then place them one on top of the other, as much as the eye needs, then bind it tightly with a firm cloth. Repeat the cupping with suction, without condition, then remove the cupping and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during that time, it should be tightened gently. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, otherwise repeat the application of the poultice, pledgets, and tightening, and the cupping until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In cutting the uvula.
If a hernia occurs in the uvular layer, then it protrudes and emerges outside the eyelids like a grape, and the person's appearance becomes ugly because of it, and you want to cut it, then the procedure is as I describe.
It is that you insert a needle into the base of the uvula from below upwards, then insert another needle with doubled thread from the side of the palate and pierce it, and leave the first needle as it is.
Then you cut the place where the doubled thread bends and tie some of the uvula around the needle with it and pull it gently, then you remove the needle and place moistened wool with egg white on the eye and leave it until the threads fall with the uvula, then you treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  You may pull the uvula from every direction with a circle of cloth until the eye protrudes gently, then you incise with a thin scalpel reaching to the depth of the eye, so the white moisture flows and the eye descends and withers in place, then you pull it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
In the treatment of canker sores.
This ailment called canker is a fluid that gathers in the eye resembling flowing water, but it is not.  The procedure is that you have the patient sit on a chair upright, then you take his head in your hands from both sides.
And move it until you see the fluid descend to the lower part of the eye, then it will remain and not move, and the light will be released, and the patient will see things as he used to see them. If it does not descend to the lower part, we know that it is water. If the descent of the fluid is not achieved by what we have mentioned,
otherwise, seat the patient before you, then take a thin lancet and make a small incision with it above the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the limbus until the material comes out.
When it comes out, instill in the eye warm water in which honey has been mixed, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have mentioned the types of water in the classification and which of them is suitable for cupping, with a detailed and explained description, so take it from there correctly. Then you should seat the patient before you, sitting squarely facing the light near the sun.
And you bind his healthy eye and tie it tightly, then you lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye in which the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the cupping instrument near the cornea, with the thickness of an awl in the same white of the eye, towards the smaller canthus, then you push the cupping instrument forcefully while turning it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the cupping instrument that it has reached something empty.
And it should be that the extent to which the cupping instrument goes into depth is the extent of the distance that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, which is the cornea, for the copper will be seen in the same view of the observer as the eye, due to the clarity of the corneal membrane, then you move the cupping instrument upwards to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards, time after time. If the water descends immediately, then the patient will see what his sight has been opened to immediately, and the cupping instrument is in his eye, then it will settle a little. If the water rises, then lower it again without removing the cupping instrument.
If it settles and does not rise, then remove the cupping instrument gently while twisting it with your hand little by little. Then dissolve in the water a little pure Andarani salt and wash the eye with it from the inside. Then apply to the outside of the whole eye a compress or wet wool.
With rose oil and egg white, and you bind it with the healthy eye. As for us and the people of our time, we place on it crushed cumin with egg white. If the cupping instrument does not enter the eye due to its hardness, for some people have very hard eyes, Then you should take the scalpel called the *barīd*, whose image is this:
Then pierce with it only the adherent part and do not prolong the piercing. It is only that you should make a slight opening for the cupping instrument, then insert the cupping instrument as we have mentioned. When your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm reclining position in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room.
And he abstains from all movements and from coughing. Make his food that which softens his constitution, and he does not move his head to the right or left at all. The bandage remains in place until the third day, then you untie it in that dark room and test his sight.
Show him things, then reapply the bandage until the seventh day. It is not proper to do this during treatment or after cupping at your hour, but rather you should avoid that before the water rises quickly with intense looking.
If a hot swelling appears, then you should untie the eye before the seventh day and treat that with what calms the swelling, until when it subsides, then at that time you release his sight and place a kerchief on his face so that his sight may exercise underneath it for days while he is in that dark room, then...
He gradually leaves the house and manages its causes. And know that in cupping, the learner cannot do without observation many times, then afterwards he proceeds to work. And it has reached me from some Iraqis that he mentioned that he makes in Iraq a cupping instrument that is penetrating, with which he draws out the water.
And I have not seen anyone in our country who made that, nor have I read it in any book of the ancients. It is possible that it is a recent innovation. And this is an image of types of cupping instruments so that he who is ignorant of them may see them:
It is made especially from copper, and its tip is of this very thinness, triangular-tipped and sharp.
Chapter twenty-four.
In the treatment of the flesh that grows in the nose.
Various kinds of flesh may grow in the nose, some of which resembles a many-legged scorpion, and some of which is cancerous flesh, hardened and dark in color, and some of which is soft flesh, not dark in color.
If any of this flesh is soft, not malignant nor cancerous, then the patient should sit before you facing the sun, and you should open his nostril and insert the snare into that flesh, then pull it outwards, and then cut what you have grasped with a sharp, delicate scalpel from one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone; if any remains that you were not able to cut, remove it gently with one of the delicate instruments, so that none remains.  If the bleeding overcomes you or a hot swelling appears,
treat it as is appropriate.  If it is one of the malignant tumors, act quickly to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone. Then place vinegar and water or a potion in the nose after the cutting. If the nose opens and the moisture passes to the throat,
know that he is healed. If the moisture does not flow as it should, know that inside there is flesh growing on the upper, weakened bones which the instrument did not reach during cutting. Then it is necessary to take a linen thread of some thickness.
and tie many knots in it, making the space between each knot the width of a finger or less. The patient should then skillfully insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or whatever is possible after he has fashioned it like a button, and pull his breath until it reaches the nasal passage.
and it emerges at his throat.  Boys often do this in school, and it is easy for anyone who wants to. Then bring together the two ends of the thread, the one that came out of the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to saw the flesh, doing this until you know that the flesh has been cut by the knots of the thread. Then remove the thread and, after wiping away the blood, place a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment in the nose. Do this for three days or more.
until the ointment consumes all the remaining flesh. Then, finally, place a lead tube in the nose for several days until it heals. If it needs drying treatment, use that.
This is an image of the instrument with which oils and medications are dripped into the nose:
It is made of silver or copper, similar to a small, open oil lamp, and its duct is likewise.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the spout of the instrument flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when you heat oil or whatever you want of juices or liquid things in it.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Frequently a wart grows on the tip of the nose, and it grows larger and increases with the days until its appearance becomes ugly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance and to excise it completely, then apply to the place either cautery or a burning medicine which acts in place of cautery.  If you fail to cut it off until it becomes large, then look; if it is hardened, solid, dark-colored and insensitive.
Then do not apply iron to it, for it is a cancerous tumor; and I have often seen that the cutting of this tumor resulted in great harm to its owner.  But if the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that its excision is possible completely, then empty the patient's bowels and cut it without hesitation or delay, and treat the place with what dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear. If their connection is separated by a wound or something similar, know that when a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, the treatment rarely benefits except in some people.
Then if something like that happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with its blood, gather the edges of the wound with sutures, then treat it until it heals. And if the separation of the connection has separated its edges and each part has become sound, then it is necessary to scrape each part to the thickness of its outer skin until it bleeds.
Then gather the edges with sutures and tighten them, and sprinkle on them mastic and frankincense, powdered, and place on top of the sutures a plaster of walnut ointment or another of the healing ointments, and leave it bound for two or three days, then unbind it.
And change the medication and leave it until the threads separate themselves, then treat it with ointment until it heals. The method of suturing is to gather the separated connection, either with needles as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread as we explained there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On removing the knots which appear in the lips.
Many people develop small, hard tumors inside their lips; some resemble the seeds of carob, some are smaller and some larger.  It is necessary to evert the lip and incise each nodule, and to extract it with a hook.
And cut it from every side, then pack the area after cutting with powdered verdigris until the bleeding stops, then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the area with a styptic until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cutting away excess gum tissue.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called epulis. It should be hooked with a hook or grasped with forceps and cut at its base. Let the blood flow, then apply powdered verdigris to the area.
Or one of the astringent, drying powders. If that flesh returns after treatment—for it often does—cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On extracting teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly crusts may gather on the surfaces of the teeth, inside and out, and between the gums.  These may blacken, yellow, or green, even causing damage to the gums and making the teeth unsightly.
You should seat the patient before you, his head in your lap, and clean the tooth or molar showing crusts and something like sand, until nothing remains.  Do the same with blackness, greenness, yellowness, and anything else, until you have cleaned it.
If the substance is removed by the first cleaning, well and good; otherwise, repeat the cleaning on another day, and a second, and a third, until you achieve your goal. Know that a molar requires many different shaped and formed instruments, depending on what is needed for your work.
Because the instrument used to clean a molar from the inside is not the same as that used to clean it from the outside, nor that used to clean between the molars, which is of another form.  These are several forms of instruments which you should have all prepared.
Chapter Thirty.
On the Extraction of Teeth.
You should treat the aching tooth by every means and delay its extraction, for there is no replacement for it once it is extracted, because it is a noble substance, except when there is no alternative to its extraction.
If the patient is determined to have it extracted, you should be certain that the aching tooth is the one to be extracted. For often the patient mistakes the pain and thinks it is in a sound tooth, so he has it extracted, and then the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted.  We have seen this done repeatedly by barbers.
If you are certain about the aching tooth itself, then you should incise around the tooth with a strong scalpel, until you loosen the gum from every side. Then move it little by little with your fingers or with delicate forceps until you loosen it.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps, and hold the patient's head between your knees, having steadied it so that it does not move.  Then pull the tooth straight so that you do not break it. If it does not come out otherwise, take one of those instruments and gently insert it under it from every side, and then move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated or decayed, you should fill that hole with a rag and pack it firmly with the end of a thin probe, lest it crumble when you pull on it with the forceps.  You should carefully incise around the gum on every side.
And guard against breaking it, for if some of it remains, it will bring the patient a worse affliction than his first pain. And beware of doing what the ignorant barbers do, in their haste and recklessness in extracting it without using what we have described.
For they often inflict great harm on people, the least of which is that the tooth breaks and all or part of its roots remain. Or it may be extracted with part of the jawbone, as we have repeatedly witnessed. Then, after its extraction, let him rinse his mouth with a drink or with vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs from the site—and this often happens—then crush some alum and pack the site with it.
Otherwise, cauterize it if the alum does not help. The image of the delicate forceps with which you first move the tooth: they should have long ends, short handles, and be thick so that they do not bend when you grasp the tooth with them. And this is the image of the large forceps:
They should be thick-handled, as you see, so that when you grasp them they do not bend or give way, and short-ended.  Let them be made of Indian iron or of well-tempered steel, with sharpened ends and teeth at the tip that interlock for a firm and secure grip.
The ends may also be made in the shape of a file, making them also strong in their grip.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the extraction of the roots of molars and the removal of fractured jawbones.
If, when extracting a molar, a root remains broken, you should apply a cotton pledget soaked in butter to the area for a day or two until the area relaxes, then insert a hook or forceps. whose ends resemble the beak of a bird called a "bulrāja," and this is an image of the forceps:
They should be made like a file on the inside or like a pelican; if you are unable to extract it with these forceps, you should excavate the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert an instrument resembling a small lever, which is depicted here:
short and somewhat thick at the end, and not pointed, lest it break; if the root is extracted by this means, well and good; otherwise, use these other instruments, which are depicted here: the first has a triangular end, somewhat thick.
Another delicate triangular image:
And we may also use this two-pronged instrument, which is also depicted here:
And other instruments and tools previously mentioned in the extraction of molars; and we may also use this instrument which resembles a large hook, which is depicted here:
triangular, curved at the end, somewhat thick, so that it does not break; it should not be pointed. And know that the instruments for molars are numerous, as are all other instruments, they are almost innumerable; and the skillful and clever craftsman may invent for himself instruments according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate.
For there are diseases for which the ancients did not mention instruments, due to the difference in their types; if a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decayed, then investigate its location with one of these instruments and hooks that were mentioned for extracting roots.
And we use a forceps, its image is this:
It should be somewhat thick to grasp the bone so that it does not escape until the bone is removed; and we treat the area with appropriate medication. If the bone has slight decay, then clean it of its decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter thirty-two.
On the extraction of molars growing on top of others.
If molars grow other than in their natural course, their appearance is unsightly, especially if this happens in women and slaves.  It should be examined; if the molar has grown behind another tooth,
and its extraction or pushing back is impossible, then extract it. And if it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this instrument, the image of which is this:
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian iron, very sharp at the tip.  Your cutting should be done over many days because of the tooth's hardness, and so that you do not loosen other teeth. But if it is protruding and you are able to file it, file it with an Indian file, the image of which is this.
It should be entirely of Indian [steel], and its cutting edge should be very fine, like the file used to make needles. File the tooth little by little over many days gently, so as not to loosen the tooth and cause it to fall out. Then file it again and remove it with some forceps.
And if a tooth is broken, and it hurts the tongue when speaking, then it should also be filed until the roughness of that break is removed, and it is even and smooth, and does not hurt the tongue or impair speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three
On binding loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loose and move due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything to eat for fear that they will fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines but the treatment has not been effective.
The remedy is to tie them with a gold or silver thread; gold is better because silver tarnishes and decays after a few days, while gold remains unchanged forever. The thread should be of moderate thickness, according to what fits between the teeth.
The method of binding is to take the thread and insert its loop between the sound teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you reach a sound tooth on the other side by weaving.
Then weave back to the side where you began and gently and skillfully tighten it so that the teeth do not move at all. Tighten the thread at the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose. Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors, gather them together, twist them, and hide them between the sound and loose teeth.
So that it does not injure the tongue. Leave it tied as it is for as long as it remains. If it becomes loose or breaks, tie it again with another thread; in this way, he will enjoy it for his whole life. This is an image of the teeth and the method of binding two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see:
A single tooth or two may be returned to their place after falling out, and bound as described, and remain.  A skilled dental craftsman does this. He may also carve a piece of ox bone to make it resemble a tooth and place it in the space where the tooth is missing. And it is tied as we have said, and remains, and he enjoys it.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cutting the ligament which appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament which appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a healed wound.
And the procedure is that you open the mouth of the patient, and his head is in your lap, and you raise his tongue, then you cut that nervous ligament transversely until the tongue is released from its constraint.  If there is some rigidity and complexity, and that is from a healed wound, then insert a hook into it and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knot is undone.
And beware that the incision is not deep in the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and bleeding results. Then, after the cutting, let him rinse with rose water or with vinegar and cold water, then place under the tongue a pledget of linen which the patient holds in place every night.
Lest it reunite. If bleeding occurs, place powdered alum on the place; and if the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize the place with a lentil-shaped cautery suitable for that. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
In the extraction of a frog generated under the tongue.
A tumor resembling a small frog may occur under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function, and perhaps it may grow large until it fills the mouth. The procedure is to open the patient's mouth facing the sun and look at the tumor.
If you see it dark in color or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, do not interfere with it, for it is a cancer. But if it is inclined to whiteness and is moist, then insert a hook into it and incise it with a fine scalpel and free it from all sides.
If blood overwhelms you during your work, then apply crushed vitriol until the bleeding stops, then return to your work until you remove it completely, then let him rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with other appropriate treatments until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
In the treatment of tonsil tumors.
And what grows in the throat from other tumors, glands may appear inside the throat similar to those that appear outside, called tonsils; if you treat them with what I mentioned in the section and they do not heal,
look; if the tumor is hard, dark in color, and insensitive, do not approach it with iron.  And if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not approach it with iron either, for fear of bleeding, but leave it until it matures, then either you may lance it, or it may burst of its own accord.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, this is what should be cut.  The procedure is that you should look before operating whether its hot inflammation has completely subsided or lessened somewhat.
Then seat the patient facing the sun, his head in your lap, and open his mouth; and take an assistant to depress his tongue with an instrument of this shape:
Make it of silver or of copper, thin like a knife. When you depress the tongue with it and the tumor is revealed to you and you see it, take a hook and insert it into the tonsil and pull it outwards as much as possible without pulling anything of the membranes with it.
Then cut it with an instrument of this shape, resembling scissors except that its ends are curved, and each of its points is very sharp, made of Indian iron or Damascus steel:
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel of this shape:
sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After you cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner. Then, after cutting, gargle the patient with cold water or with vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves or similar astringents have been boiled until the bleeding stops, then treat him until he recovers.  Other tumors besides the tonsils may grow in the throat; cut them as I described for the tonsils.
I treated a woman with a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a polyp, somewhat insensitive, and nearly blocking her throat. The woman was breathing through a narrow passage and was prevented from eating and drinking water.
She was near death if she remained a day or two.  Two branches extended from the tumor until they emerged from her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserted a hook into one, and pulled; a suitable piece was drawn out.
Then I cut it where I reached it from the nostril.  I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue, inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut some of it. Only a little blood flowed.
The woman's throat opened, and she immediately began to drink water and eat. We continued to cut away portions of that tumor repeatedly over a long time, the tumor replacing what was cut, until it became protracted for both of us.
Then I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside the throat with a cautery. It stopped growing, then she traveled away, and I did not know what God did with her afterward.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On cutting a tumor of the uvula.
That which is called a grape, if a catarrhal discharge descends to the uvula and swells and is white and elongated, then it is called a column; but if it is thick below and round, then it is called a grape. If it is treated with what we mentioned in the classification, and the treatment is not effective,
and I saw that the hot tumor had subsided from it and it was thin, then it should be cut, and whatever part of it is gathered together and round, and does not have length, and is bloody or the color of a clot, or black, or insensitive, then it should be avoided cutting it.
For there is danger to the patient.  Therefore, if you see it in the manner which I described, of its whiteness and length, then seat the patient next to the sun and compress his tongue with the instrument previously described, then pierce the grape with the hook.
And pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in cutting the tonsils. And it is necessary that you cut only that which exceeds the natural state without excess, for if you cut more of it you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after cutting, use what we described in cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is afraid of cutting it, then it is necessary to use a method for cauterizing it without fear or caution. The method of cauterization is with a sharp medicine, and that is to place the head of the patient in your lap.
Then compress his tongue with the instrument we mentioned, then take from the sharp water which I mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with unquenched lime, and make it neither thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument with it, and this is its image:.
Its end, in which you place the medicine, has a concavity like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, and the patient lying on his side so that the saliva flows from his mouth from inside his throat, lest anything descend from it to his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine while you squeeze it on the uvula for about half an hour until you see that it has blackened and the sting of the medicine has subsided. And if you wish, take cotton, wrap it around the end of a probe, and wet the cotton in the medicine.
And insert the probe with the cotton into the tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula, then leave it; it will wither and fall after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it.
After cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter and wipe away the medicine around it. Then gargle with cold water and treat from the outside with lotions and from the inside with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and further from fear.
The uvula may also be treated with something gentler than cautery and cutting; it is treated with fumigation in this manner: take foeniculum, hyssop, thyme, rue, wormwood, chamomile, and absinthium, and similar herbs; gather them all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
And boil [the herbs], the pot being plastered with philosopher's clay, and there should be a hole in the middle of the lid onto which a hollow instrument is fitted, made in this manner, of silver or copper:
And insert the end which contains the pomegranate into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube until the uvula is thoroughly steamed. Then repeat this several times until it withers. And beware of performing this treatment at the first onset of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling. It is only appropriate to do this when its hot swelling subsides. If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and fit an eggshell to its end, lest the patient's mouth be burned.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the vapor from burning the mouth, and this is a good treatment along with its safety.
Chapter thirty-eight.
On removing thorns and other things that lodge in the throat.
Often a bone or fishbone or something else lodges in the throat. It is necessary to remove what is visible to the eye after you have pressed down the tongue with an instrument towards the uvula.
So that you may see what is in the throat, and if it does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, then it is necessary to induce vomiting in the patient before his food is digested in his stomach, for perhaps the lodged thing will come out with the vomit, or the patient may swallow a piece of beet or a lettuce root.
Or he may swallow a mouthful of dry bread, or you may take a piece of soft sea sponge and tie it to a string, then he swallows it, and when it reaches the place of the thorn, pull the string quickly; do this repeatedly.
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and come out. If it does not come out by what we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument of this shape:
It should be slightly thicker than an awl, and at its tip a hook. The patient inserts it gently into his throat while raising his head upwards, and he must be careful not to touch his larynx lest it cause coughing, and he pushes out the bone or thorn; or the physician inserts it with his hand.
And it is better for the patient to insert it himself, for he knows the location of the lodged object, and he pushes downwards or pulls upwards with the instrument, all according to what he can manage, until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If you treat the leech with what we mentioned in the section on medicinal treatment and it is ineffective, then look into the patient's throat in the sunlight after you have depressed his tongue with the instrument I described to you.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a soft, well-made forceps; but if you cannot manage it otherwise, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then insert a heated iron into the tube.
Do this repeatedly, and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day; then let him take a jug full of cold water, open his mouth into it, and rinse his mouth with it, without swallowing a drop, moving the water around from time to time with his hand.
The leech will fall out when it feels the water; but if it does not come out as described, fumigate the throat with urine and with asafoetida, using the instrument described for fumigating the tonsils; do this repeatedly, for it will fall out.
The method of fumigation is as follows: take a pot containing hot embers, the pot being covered with a lid having a hole in the middle; then fit the end of the instrument into this hole, and place the fumigant in it; then let the patient put his mouth to the end of the tube and close his mouth so that the fumigant does not escape until he knows that the fumigant has reached his throat.
Then the leech will fall out; but if it does not fall out, repeat the fumigation; let the patient endure thirst, and eat salt and garlic, but drink no water; the leech must come out by this means.  And this is an image of an instrument by which the leech is drawn from the throat when it is seen.
It resembles hooks, as you see, except that it has this curve which enters the throat, and its two ends resemble the beak of a bird; they have the roughness of a file, so that if they grip anything, they do not let go.
And another instrument, with which the tongue is compressed; it is a wide iron ring, large enough to encompass the mouth above the tongue; it is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, so that the mouth remains open without the patient's will, and he cannot remove it at all until it is taken away.
Description of the instrument with which the mouth is opened in this very way.
Chapter Forty.
It will deal with the cauterization and incision of tumors.
Tumors are numerous and varied in kind, as will be described one by one in this book, and they differ in their cauterization and incision in two respects: one, from the type of tumor itself and what it contains of humors.
And the second type is due to the locations in the body where they occur, for a tumor occurring in the head is not like a tumor occurring in the anus, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy location is not like a tumor occurring in a joint; each has its own ruling in treatment.
And some tumors should not be cauterized except after the pus in them has matured and is complete, and some should be cauterized while they are raw and have not fully matured, such as tumors that are near the joints.
For if a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition persists until it corrupts what is around it, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, thus causing the dysfunction of that limb; or the tumor may be near a principal organ.
Because if you delay its cauterization until it matures, you will harm that principal organ; or it may be near the anus, so cauterize it raw.  It is necessary to cauterize a raw tumor that is not fully mature which is near the anus, lest it ulcerate and penetrate into the anus and become a fistula.
And it becomes something that will not heal. You should know the time for cauterizing tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor softens, and other signs appear.
And you should apply the cauterization in the lowest part of the tumor, if possible, so that the flow of matter is easier downwards, or in the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor.  The cauterization should be lengthwise if the tumors are in the hands or feet.
And the places of the muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and in general, in all the flat places which do not bend. But those which bend, the cauterization should follow the shape of that place. And if the tumor is in fleshy places, it is best to leave it uncauterized.
Until its maturation is complete, as we have said, for if you cauterize it before that, the discharge of pus will be prolonged, causing much harm and filth, and perhaps its lips and base will harden.  Some tumors may be cauterized across the body, if necessary, or according to what the organ requires.
And you should use a single cauterization for small tumors, and for large tumors, a wide cauterization or many incisions, according to the size of the tumor.  There may be tumors which require the skin to be incised and cut if it has become like a rag.
And it has reached the point where that which is dead is like that which occurs in many abscesses and hidden tumors. Some of them are incised with a three-sided incision, and some are cut from it in the shape of an ivy leaf, like the inguinal tumor.
And some use a circular incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions.  And if it does not have a head, like smooth, flat tumors, then it should only be cauterized simply. And if the tumor is large and has gathered for a long time, and you cauterize it, you should not rush to remove all the pus at that time.
Rather, remove some of it, then dress the tumor until the next day, then remove some of the pus again. Do this repeatedly gradually until you remove all of it.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person, for the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden removal of pus, so the patient may die and you do not realize it. Therefore, be extremely cautious in this matter.
After cauterizing these tumors, you should wipe the wound and look. If the wound of the tumor is small or the incision is single and simple, then use a lint of linen or old cotton.  If the tumor is large and the incisions from cauterization are many,
then you should insert a wick into each incision until some reach each other. And if some of the skin of the tumor has been cut or thinned, then you should pack it with old cotton or linen lint without moisture, and dress it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a linen cloth in them, and apply it to the bleeding site repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the procedures, treatments, and remedies that we have described in many places in this book and in the divisions. If you are in winter and the location of the tumor is very nervous, then you should moisten the surrounding tissues with a warm potion and oil.
And place them on the area. If you are in summer and the areas are fleshy, then you should apply the surrounding tissues soaked in water and oil or in a potion and oil, all of it cold, until the third day, as we said. Then you should untie the tumor and wipe it.
And use something similar in its treatment until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for the detailed method, I have described how to treat each tumor, categorized and summarized.
Chapter forty-one.
On incisions for tumors that appear in the scalp.
Small tumors appear in the scalp; they are a type of boil, contained within membranes, and have characteristics like a chicken's pouch.  Their types are numerous; some are fatty, and some contain a moisture resembling pus.
Some contain a moisture resembling whey and broth, and so on; some are hard and calcified. There is no danger in incising and removing all of them, unless you encounter an artery during the incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument whose image comes after this, which is called the *muddass*, so that you know what it contains. If what it contains is moisture, then incise it lengthwise with a simple incision in this manner:.
Begin the incision from line B to line C. When the moisture has drained, excise the sac that contained that moisture and cut it all away, leaving nothing at all, for it often recurs if any of it remains.
Then dip cotton in yellow ointment, if available; otherwise, in salt water, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day, for it consumes what remains of the sac. Then reapply the cotton with the yellow ointment a second and third time, if necessary.
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the tumor contains a fatty substance, incise it in this manner:
Make a firm incision and place hooks in the lips of the wound and peel it from every side and exert yourself to remove the membrane which contains it. If an artery obstructs you, do as I described to you before; and likewise do in the tumor if it is hardened from the incision.
The treatment is the same as I mentioned. The incision on the hardened tumor is easier because it contains little blood and moisture.  Some of these tumors which are in the head in some people have no moisture at all, and that is because I incised a tumor in...
the head of an old woman, and I found the tumor like hard, rough, white stone, unable to be broken, and if someone threw it, it would cut him. And it was not like the other tumors occurring in the head, except for these, like the tumors that appear in the heads of children.
And at the roots of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision and make their bottoms from their lower parts so that the flow of the matter is easy to the lower part, then treat them with what suits them of treatment.
Chapter forty-two.
Concerning the incision on the swellings which frequently appear in the neck. These tumors frequently appear in the neck and under the armpits and in the groins, and they may appear in the rest of the body. That which appears in the neck may be one or many, and some of them develop from others.
And every swelling of them is within a special membrane, as is the case in the abscesses and tumors of the head as we have described. And the types of these swellings are many; some are calcified, some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
And I have not seen one of them in good condition to the touch, and its appearance was close to the color of the skin; it moved in every direction, and it was not attached to a nerve of the neck, nor to a vein, nor to an artery, nor was it sunken. Then it should be incised with a simple incision from the top to the bottom of the body in this manner, from line J to line B.
And peel it from every side, and spread the edges of the skin with a hook or two hooks, or many hooks if necessary, as we said in the case of tumors of the head. And remove it little by little, and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and let the scalpel not be too sharp.
Lest your hand increase the cutting, or the patient be disturbed, and you cut what you do not need to cut.  If you cut a vein or artery and it hinders your work, place powdered verdigris or some styptics in the wound.
And bind the wound and leave it until the intensity of the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to suppurate, for the bleeding will then stop. Then return to your work until you finish. Then examine with your index finger if anything remains, then other small worms, and cut them and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the root of the worm, then it should not be cut from its root, but it should be tied with a strong double thread and left until it falls off by itself without harm. Then stuff the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if the entire worm is cut, then it is necessary to bring together the edges of the wound and stitch it immediately after you know that no residue remains. If you see that a residue of the worm's bone remains,
then you should aim to cut to its root and base and use sutures and what we have mentioned. And as for the worms that contain fluids, apply a simple poultice where their ripeness appears, and place the poultice on the lower side as we said.
Then, after the poultice, use a dressing with Egyptian ointment or the like to consume what remains of the corruption, until you see that the wound has cleansed, then treat it with ointments that regenerate flesh until it heals.
Chapter forty-three.
Concerning the incision of the throat for a tumor that occurs inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is the account of their words. As for those with angina, they should avoid incision of the throat, for they will not benefit from it.
Because all the veins and the lung will be weak. But those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no illness in the windpipe, then the incision of the throat is necessary to escape the danger of suffocation.
Then, if we want to do this, we should incise the throat below three or four rings of the windpipe, a small transverse incision between two rings, to the extent of the incision in the peritoneum, not in the cartilage. This location is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it. If the physician is timid, he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until he reaches the windpipe, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should incise the peritoneum which we have described.  The incision of the windpipe is indicated by the phlegm which comes out of it, along with what is excised, and by the cessation of the voice. The wound is left open for a time, and when the time when suffocation was feared has passed, the edges of the wound are joined from the skin.
And its outline is separate from the cartilage. Then use the medicines which cause the growth of flesh until it heals.  The author of this book said, the explanation of all this which we have related is only if they see the patient's throat obstructed by one of these tumors which have been mentioned.
And the patient was close to death, and his breath was about to cease. They proceeded to incise the throat so that the patient might breathe somewhat through the wound and be saved from death. And they ordered that the wound be left open until the severity of the illness is over; its severity being about three days or so.
Then they ordered the wound to be sutured and treated until it healed. What I witnessed myself is that a maidservant took a knife and passed it across her throat, cutting some of the lung windpipe. I was called to treat her, and I found her expiring like one who is slaughtered. So I uncovered the wound.
Then I found the blood which came out of the wound was slight, and I was certain that she had not cut a vein or artery.  And the breath was coming out of the wound. So I proceeded and sutured the wound and treated it until it healed. And nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in the voice, nothing more.
And after days she returned to her best condition.  Therefore, we say that incision of the throat is not dangerous.
Chapter forty-four.
Concerning the incision of the tumor which appears in the throat from the outside and is called the elephant of the throat.
This tumor which is called the elephant of the throat is a large tumor of the color of the body.  It is frequent in women and is of two kinds.
It is either natural or accidental. As for the natural, there is no remedy for it; as for the accidental, it is of two kinds: one resembling fatty swellings, the other resembling the tumor which results from the complication of the artery, and its incision is dangerous. Therefore, one should not at all apply iron to it, except for that which is small; if you probe and examine it with a probe and find it resembles a fatty swelling and is not attached to any of the veins, then incise it as you incise fatty swellings. And remove it with its containing sac, if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove it all completely, then treat the place with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter forty-five.
On the incision of various swellings.
Swellings are numerous in types, and I have mentioned all their types in the classification. It is necessary to explain here the difference between a swelling and an abscess, since it is difficult.  I say that with an abscess there is heat, fever, and frightening pains until the boiling of the matter subsides. And the corruption is completed, then the fever and intensity subside.  A swelling, however, has neither heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it is contained in a serous sac, which is its special covering. It is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a lentil, and it becomes like a blister, larger or smaller.
And it is of two types: either fatty, or containing moisture. The types of moisture are many, as I have mentioned in the classification. Therefore, when you come to treat a swelling, you should probe and examine it first with the instrument called the probe, whose image is given in the chapter after this.
Assess the size of the tumor, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after it. If fluid of any color comes out, incise it with a simple incision as I have described for other tumors.  If no fluid comes out after the probe, know that it is fatty.
Then make a crucial incision on it in this manner as I have taught you, and hook it with hooks.  Peel the skin from every side gently, and preserve the sac if you can, so that you remove it whole with the swelling.
If the sac is ruptured during the procedure and you cannot remove it whole—and this often happens—remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. For if any part, however small or large, remains, the swelling will most likely return.
If it overcomes you and a little remains, cauterize the wound at its edges with some sharp corrosive.  Then stitch the wound and place on top of it something that soothes hot swellings, and treat it with other treatments until it heals. If the swelling is large, suture its edges and treat it with what will unite them.
If you encounter a bleeding or non-bleeding vessel and bleeding occurs, quickly cauterize the area with powdered vitriol and leave it bound for two or three days until the wound becomes necrotic and the bleeding subsides.  Then return to removing what remains of the swelling.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On the forms of instruments.
Those which are used in incision and cauterization; among these are the forms of probes, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are made of strong steel, square-ended, and tightly fitting to expedite entry into tumors.  These are images of probes, also called punches, and they are also of three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are suitable for exploring tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities for what is inside them of bones and the like. They are made round, polished, and smooth like styluses from Chinese copper or Spatarium or from copper or from iron or from silver, and the best of them are those made from Spatarium.
Probes may also be made of black lead.  They are suitable for probing fistulas which have a bend in their depth, so that they flex gently with that bend. They are also of three types, for some are long, some are medium, and some are short.
According to the need of the depth of each fistula, and its thickness is made according to the width and narrowness of the fistula. Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
The images of the hooks; they are numerous types, for there are simple ones, I mean those with one hook, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small. And there are the blind hooks, and they are of three types. And there are the hooks with two hooks, and they are of three types. And there are the curved hooks with two hooks. And they are three types. And there are hooks with three hooks, and they are three types. And all these types, each one is needed in its place. Image of a large simple hook. Image of a medium simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.
Image of a large blind hook. Image of a medium blind hook.
Image of a small blind hook.
Image of a large hook with two hooks. Image of a medium hook with two hooks. Image of a small hook with two hooks.

And these are images of the scalpels with which swellings and tumors are incised and dissected; they are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.

Image of a small scalpel.
Their edges, with which it incises, are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp; rather, they are made thus so that one may use them in dissecting the swelling when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient may be eased and find a little relief from the burning that he feels when the tumor is dissected.
And these are images of the probes; they are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large probe.
It is made of copper, similar to the style used for kohl, and at one end is something like a broad spoon of two layers, which has in its head a hidden lancet blade resembling a bird’s tongue which moves in and out as you wish, as you see.
Images of the scalpels which are inserted between the fingers when cutting tumors, without the patient feeling them; they are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Images of the cupping instruments with which blood is drawn; they are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of the large cupping instrument.
They are made of copper or china, slightly elongated as you see, and thin.  It is necessary that you have these types of cupping instruments, large and small, to draw blood quickly when necessary and when medicine is not at hand.
But it is not used to draw blood from every part of the body, but rather it is used in fleshy parts, such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, the muscles of the arm, the breast, the abdomen, the groin, and similar moist fleshy parts.
And other small instruments may be made from them, resembling pistachio shells, in this manner:
Blood is drawn with them if it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or when a vein or artery is cut.  And they may be made round in this manner:
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On the treatment of men's breasts.
The breasts of some people may swell at the time of puberty until they resemble women's breasts, remaining swollen and unsightly.  Whoever dislikes this should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this manner.
From line B to line C. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with cauterizing medicine, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If the breast inclines downwards and relaxes from its bone, as happens to women,
it should be incised on its upper sides with two crescent-shaped incisions, each connecting with the other at their ends so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one, in this manner: From line B to line C, then you should remove the skin between the incisions and remove the fat and use what we mentioned of sutures and cauterization and whatever treatment is needed until it heals.
If you do not manage to cut what you need to cut because of the patient's anxiety or because of bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in caustic ointment and leave it until it eats away the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter forty-eight.
On the treatment of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are a type of hard, cystic swellings, some of which contain fluids.  Those containing fluids should be incised with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner.
From line B to line C.  If all the fluid in the tumor is evacuated, pack it with old cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with a suitable ointment until it heals. If the tumor is a type of nodular swelling, incise it as we mentioned in the incision on swellings. If the wound extends and pus develops, use cautery as we previously described.
Chapter forty-nine.
On incising a tumor that appears near an artery or vein, called aneurysma.
If an artery is injured and the skin over it unites, a tumor often results from this; similarly, a vein may also develop swelling and a tumor.
The signs by which one knows if the tumor and swelling are from an artery or from a vein are: if the tumor is from an artery, it is elongated, deep-seated in the body; and if you press the tumor with your finger, you feel as if it has a creaking sound.
That which is from a vein, the tumor is round and on the surface of the body; incision of these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many places in the body where they are very large; therefore, one should avoid treating them with iron.
And those that are also in the extremities or in the head should be avoided.  As for those that are a swelling of the mouth of an artery, incise it in the skin lengthwise, then open the incision with hooks, then dissect the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I have taught you in the ligation of the two arteries in the temples; then incise with a scalpel the area between the ligatures until all the blood in it comes out.
Then the tumor will resolve, and you use treatment that produces pus until the ligatures fall off; then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the tumor is from a severed vein, you should hold with your hand as much of the tumor as possible along with the skin, then insert a needle below the area you held with your hand and pass it through with a doubled thread until you bring it out from the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly with it, according to what I have mentioned to you in tying the uvula from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads will slip, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire tumor at the crossing point of the first needle.
And tighten your threads in four places, then incise the tumor in its middle until what is inside comes out. Then cut away the excess skin and leave what was tied. Then apply a dressing that you have soaked in a drink and oil. Then use treatment with cautery and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor that occurs from the twisting of a nerve.
Just as a tumor appears in the artery and vein, so too does a tumor appear in the nerve if a blow occurs to it or it occurs from excessive exertion or the like.  This is most common in the wrists and heels.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a chronic tumor resembling in color the rest of the body. In most cases it is painless, and if pressed hard, the patient feels a kind of numbness. The tumor is not deep within the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in every direction, but not forward or backward.  As for those in the joints, they should not be treated with iron, for it may cause gangrene. As for those in the head or forehead…
Then incise the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from its root. If it is large, hook it with a hook and peel it off, then remove it and close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.
Chapter fifty-one.
Concerning the excision of warts that appear on the abdomen.
Many people develop warts on their abdomens and other parts of their bodies.  These are called fungal warts because of their resemblance to mushrooms. Their root is thin and their head thick; their lips may become inverted, and some are small while others become very large.
I once saw a man who had two warts on his abdomen that resembled mushrooms. They were thin and white at the root, their lips inverted and cracked, and moisture constantly flowed from them. I excised them; one weighed about eighteen ounces and the other about six.
In excising them, observe that if the patient is moist and the wart is white, moist, and thin-rooted, cut it with a broad scalpel. Keep cauteries at hand in the fire, for often much blood flows when they are cut.
If the bleeding is excessive, immediately cauterize it. If you find the patient cowardly and afraid of being cut with iron, take a strong lead thread and tie it tightly around the wart of this type. Leave it for two days, then increase the tightness of the lead, continuing to tighten it.
Keep tightening it until it affects the wart so that it separates and falls off by itself without any effort. If the wart has a thick root, there is some danger and uncertainty in cutting it, especially if it is in the abdomen; however, it may be possible to cut half of it or part of it.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return, and then treat it until the wound heals. Beware of cutting a wart that is dark in color, insensitive, and unsightly, for it is a cancerous tumor; we will discuss cancer later.
Chapter Fifty-Two
In the treatment of umbilical hernias.
Umbilical hernias result from many causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum of the abdomen, from which fat or intestine protrudes, as happens in other hernias; or from blood emitted from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from wind that is impacted there.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and protrusion of fat, then the tumor will be similar in color to the body, soft, painless, and will appear in various positions. If it is due to the protrusion of intestine, its position will be, as we have described, more variable. If you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns; sometimes there is gurgling, and it becomes much larger upon entering a bath or with severe exertion. If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
It does not disappear when pressed with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, then along with these signs the tumor will appear dark. If it is due to newly grown flesh, the tumor will be firm, hard, and remain the same size.
If it is due to wind, it will be soft to the touch. The treatment is as follows: if the umbilical hernia is due to blood from an artery or vein, or to wind, you should refrain from treating it, for there is danger and uncertainty, as I have explained in the chapter where I discussed tumors that arise from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical hernia is due to intestine or fat, you should instruct the patient to hold his breath and stand upright, then mark with ink around the entire umbilicus. Then instruct him to lie on his back before you. Then incise with a wide scalpel around the umbilicus at the place you marked with ink. Then pull the middle of the tumor upwards with a large forceps, and then tie the incised area with a strong thread or silk tendon, tightly.
The knot of the ligature should be a slip-knot. Then open the middle of the tightened tumor above the ligature and insert your index finger, seeking the intestine. If you find that the ligature has grasped it, loosen the knot and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If you find fat, pull it out with forceps.
And cut away its excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, ligate it carefully and return to your work. Take two needles and thread them with strong threads, and insert the needles into the incision you made around the tumor, crisscrossing them, then tighten the tumor at four points over the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the tightened flesh decays and falls off by itself, or cut it off when it softens and decays. Then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical hernia consists of flesh that has grown there,
or of moisture, you should constrict the tumor as we said, and remove the blood or moisture that you find within, then treat it with whatever closes the wound.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
In the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medication, and warned against treating it with iron lest it ulcerate; and we have mentioned cancer that develops in the uterus and warned against treating it.
And the ancients mentioned that whenever the cancer is in a place that can be completely excised, like cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar accessible members, its removal in its entirety is possible, especially if it is small and beginning; but if it is old and large, then it should not be touched.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that.  The procedure, if it is accessible as we said, is to first purge the patient of black bile several times, then to bleed him if there is evident fullness in the veins.
Then you position the patient in a position that allows for the procedure, then you apply hooks suitable for the cancer, then you scrape it from every side along with the skin completely, until nothing of its roots remains; and let the blood flow and do not stop it quickly.
Rather, squeeze the areas and remove all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can; and if during the procedure you encounter great bleeding from a severed artery or vein, then tie off the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter fifty-four.
On the treatment of elephantiasis.
We have already explained in the classification the types of dropsy, how the accumulation of water occurs, and the signs of each type and its treatment with medication. That which is treated with cautery is only the ascitic type, and the tympanitic type and the fleshy type are not at all approached with cautery.
For that is fatal, if you have treated this type of ascitic elephantiasis with medication and your treatment has not been effective, then see if the patient is extremely weak or has another illness besides elephantiasis, such as...
cough or diarrhea or something similar, then beware of treating him with cautery, for that is dangerous.  If you see that the patient is strong, has no illness other than elephantiasis alone, and is neither a child nor an old man, then the method of treatment is to have the patient stand before you. and an attendant behind him squeezing his abdomen with his hands and pushing the water downwards towards the pubic area, then take a lancet like this:
pointed at both ends, long, with a defined tip like a lancet, except that it has a slight curve so that it does not penetrate the intestines during the procedure and injure them. Then look, if the elephantiasis originated from the region of the intestines...
then it is necessary that you make the incision three fingers' breadth below the navel, directly above the pubic area. If the elephantiasis originated from liver disease, let your incision be three fingers' breadth to the left of the navel; if it originated from spleen disease, let the incision be on the right side by three fingers' breadth.
Also, the incision should not be on the side on which the patient intends to lie down, lest the fluids flow to that weak place. Then pierce the skin completely with the instrument, then insert the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.
with the lancet between the skin and the peritoneum, as if you are stripping it off, and the amount you strip off should be the size of a fingernail or thereabouts. Then pierce the peritoneum until the lancet reaches an empty space, which is the location of the water, then withdraw it and insert into the opening the instrument which has this form.
It is like a small tube made of thin cane, silver, copper, or smooth, polished lead. It has a small hole at its lower end and three holes in its sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And its sharpened end may be in the shape of a pen nib, like this image:.
At its upper end is a ring; when the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately flow down the instrument, and a moderate amount of water will be evacuated at once. For if you evacuate more than is necessary at once, the patient may die from the dissolution of his vital spirit.
Or he may experience a faintness approaching death. But evacuate according to his strength and what the patient's condition indicates—the strength of his pulse and the good color of his skin—then remove the instrument and the water will be retained, for it will be retained immediately.
Because of the skin that holds the hole in the peritoneum, which I have instructed you to stitch in that manner. Then you can reinsert the instrument another day if you see the patient able to tolerate it.
And you will also remove a small amount of water; do this for several days while carefully watching and guarding against error, until only a little water remains.  If you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, treat him by burying him in hot sand.
And profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and enduring thirst, and treating him with drying medications until he recovers.  And cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as I described before.
Chapter Fifty-Five
In the treatment of children who are born with their urinary passages unperforated, or with a narrow or misplaced opening.
Some boys may be born with their urethra imperforate; you should immediately perforate it upon birth.
With a very fine scalpel, in this manner:
Then place a thin lead nail in the opening, bind it, and leave it for three or four days. When he wants to urinate, remove it, and then replace it afterwards. If you do not use lead, it is possible that the urine flowing over the area will not allow it to close.
As for him whose opening is narrow, treat it with lead as we have said for many days until it widens.  Those whose opening is misplaced—some are born with the opening at the end of the penis and are unable to urinate forwards.
He must lift his urethra upwards by hand;  this is because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line, and this is a very bad condition. The way to treat this is for the patient to lie on his back.
Then stretch his penis with your left hand with a strong pull, and incise the tip of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, like a pen nib, or as if you are carving something so that its middle protrudes, resembling a penis, and the opening is in the middle as it should be.
And be careful during your work not to cause bleeding, for this often happens; so stop the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter fifty-six.
On the ulcer that appears on the foreskin and penis, and the blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.
This ulcer often appears in the urethra; it is a rough fleshy growth, and there is benign and malignant.  The benign should be tied off with a fine ligature.
And cut it until you remove it all, then apply a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it afterwards with palm ointment until it heals. But if the ulcer is malignant and dark in color, then you should cauterize it after cutting and removing it.
If the ulcer is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and part outside, then you should remove the ulcer that is inside first, until it heals, then treat it from the outside.
Because if you treat them both together, you do not prevent the foreskin from being perforated.  It may also appear in women, and in the foreskin, blackness and corruption; then you should excise everything that has blackened and threatens to corrupt or has already corrupted.
Then apply honey mixed with crushed and sifted pomegranate peel and acacia, then treat it with other treatments until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped cautery iron in this manner:
For cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean bleeding and the wound if it becomes corrupted. If the cautery eats away and disappears completely at some time, then you should insert a lead tube into the urinary canal so that the patient urinates through it. As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the cautery...
This adhesion only happens in those whose foreskin is healthy and who have not been circumcised.  It may also occur due to a wound or swelling. Then you should separate it with a blunt scalpel until the bond is loosened and the cautery is freed from every side.
If it is difficult to distinguish them completely, then you should remove some of the cautery and some of the foreskin.  For the foreskin is thin, and it may easily perforate due to its thinness.  Then separate the foreskin from the cautery with a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water, lest it adhere again.
Then treat with an astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
On the cleansing of boys and the treatment of what may befall them of harm.
Circumcision is nothing other than a separation of a connection like other wounds, except that since it is done by our will, and its use is especially in boys, it is necessary for us to describe the best procedure in it.
And the easiest path leading to safety.  I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws, but rather it is something we have acquired.
by experience.  And that is that I found the majority of surgeons and barbers using cleansing with the scalpel and with scissors, and they use the cautery and ligature with thread and cutting with the nail.  I have tried all these methods.
So I found nothing better than cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread, because cleansing with the scalpel often adheres to the skin, because the skin of the foreskin is two layers, so perhaps the upper layer of skin is cut and the lower layer remains.
Thus he is forced to cut again and renewed pain, and cauterization does not prevent cutting the end of the urethra, because it might enter its opening. As for cleansing with the nail, the skin might slip and your work is spoiled, or the boy's skin might be naturally short…
For they are often born thus and do not need cleansing.  And I have seen this. As for cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread, experience has revealed its excellence to me, because the cutting of the scissors is proportionate, since the blade which is above is like the blade which is below.
So when you squeeze your hand with the proportion of the two blades, you cut to one measure and in one time, so the thread becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra from all sides, with no mistake at all. The method of operation first is that you reassure the boy.
Especially if he is one who understands a little that you are only tying the thread in his urethra and leaving him until another day, then rejoice him and please him in every way you can and that he accepts with his mind, then stand him erect between your hands.
And let him not be sitting, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy's eye does not fall upon it at all, nor upon anything of the instruments. Then you insert your hand into his urethra and inflate the skin and lift it upwards until the glans penis emerges.
Then you cleanse it from what gathers in it of filth, then tie the marked place with a doubled thread, then tie a second ligature a little below it, then grasp with your thumb and index finger the place of the lower ligature firmly and cut between the two ligatures. Then raise the skin upwards quickly and bring out the glans penis, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and lessens the swelling of the urethra, then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some ash of burnt dry gourd, for it is the best I have tried, or finely powdered alkanet, for it is also excellent.
Then raise the skin upwards quickly and bring out the glans penis, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and lessens the swelling of the urethra, then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some ash of burnt dry gourd, for it is the best I have tried, or finely powdered alkanet, for it is also excellent. Then apply a dressing from above in a piece of fine linen, a cooked egg white beaten with fresh, sweet rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, then treat it with the other treatments until it heals.
And this is the image of the scissors which are suitable for circumcision:
They should be sharp, cutting, without curve, well-riveted, and the length of the two blades should be equal to the length of the handles. As for the mistake that occurs in circumcision, sometimes the inner skin is completely or partially inverted during cutting; it should be extended immediately with your fingernail before the place swells.
And cut it evenly; if you are unable to hold it with your fingernail, then pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days have passed and what is under the glans penis remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the acute inflammation subsides and then remove it gently.
And cut it as seems best to you, and be careful of the glans penis, for if something of the glans penis is cut, it does no harm; treat it with that which heals wounds from the plasters which we described in the chapter on plasters.
And if more of the skin than necessary is cut and it retracts upwards, that also does little harm; treat it as mentioned until it heals.
Chapter fifty-eight.
On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder is due to its obstruction by a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or a growth, and the like.  If you treat that with what we have mentioned of the types of treatment described in the classification.
And if the urine does not flow, and you see that its retention is due to a stone that has lodged in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that the patient sit on his knees, then one person mounts his back, extending his belly against his back, and the patient holds himself as much as he can.
Then the neck of the bladder will be forced to push the stone backwards, and the urine will flow. If it does not flow by what we have mentioned, and the matter becomes severe for the patient, then it is necessary that you use its removal with the instrument called a catheter, whose image is this:
It is made of silver, and it is thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's feather in thinness, long about a span and a half, having a gentle funnel at its head. The way to draw off the urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie to its end wool or cotton firmly.
And you insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut with scissors if any of the wool remains so that it enters the tube and closes it like a button. Then you lubricate the catheter with oil, or butter, or egg white, and you seat the patient on a chair.
And you clean his bladder and his urethra with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water. Then you insert the catheter into the urethra gently until it reaches the root of the urethra, then you bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then you push the catheter inside it.
Until, when the urethra is fully bent, then you push the catheter inside until, when it reaches near the rectum, you incline the penis downwards with the catheter inside it, then you push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has reached something hollow.
And it is made in this manner because the passage through which the urine passes is crooked. Then you pull the thread with the wool gently, for the urine follows the wool, then you remove it and the urine flows out, and you return the catheter.
You continue to do that until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter fifty-nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
And the images of the instruments suitable for this are made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as fine as pus, and you want to instill water and medicines into it, and this is done with an instrument called a syringe, and this is its image:
It is made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as fine as a hair, entirely hollow except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow place in which the propellant is, is only as much as will fill it without excess, so that when you draw something of the fluids with it, it is drawn, and when you push with it, it is pushed further, as is done by the squirt that throws oil in sea battles.
Then if you wish to put fluids into the bladder, you insert the tip of the syringe into the fluid and draw upwards with the plunger, then the fluid will be drawn into the body of the syringe, then you insert its tip into the urethra as we described in the catheters, then you push the fluid with the plunger.
Then that fluid will reach the bladder accordingly until the patient feels it, and this is the image of a fine clyster also with which the bladder is injected:
It is made of silver or lead, its upper end resembling a small funnel, and below it a groove in which the ligature is placed; then you take a camel's bladder and put in it the fluid which you wish to inject into the bladder, then tie it firmly between the grooves with a doubled thread.
And warm that fluid a little over the fire, then insert the tip of the clyster into the urethra, then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the fluid firmly until the patient feels that fluid has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it and pierce it all around, then insert a strong thread into those holes as you go around, then gather the circle as you gather a tablecloth after you have put in it what you want of fluids, ointments, and water.
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, squeezing your hand until the fluid reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
In the extraction of the stone.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and mentioned the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys and the stone generated in the bladder, and the signs of all that, and mentioned the stone in which work with the hand and incision is done.
This is the stone generated specifically in the bladder and that which becomes lodged in the urethra, and I am describing that with clear explanation and brevity.
I say that the stone generated in the bladder most often affects boys, and among its signs is that urine exits the bladder similar to water in its thinness.
And sand appears in it, and he scratches his penis and plays with it, and often it hangs down, then spreads, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them.  And it is easy to cure boys of it until they reach fourteen years of age, and it is difficult in old men; as for young men, it is moderate between that.
And the one whose stone is larger, his treatment is easier, and the smaller one is the opposite. So if we come to treatment, it is necessary first that the patient be injected with an enema that removes all the stool in his intestines, for it may prevent the finding of the stone upon examination.
Then the patient is taken by his legs, and he is shaken and jolted downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place repeatedly. Then you seat him between your hands upright, with his hands under his thighs, so that the entire bladder is inclined downwards, then you examine him.
And palpate him from the outside. If you feel the stone in the space, then immediately begin to incise upon it.  If it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to lubricate the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.
If he is a fully grown boy, then insert it into his anus and search for the stone until, when it falls under your finger, you move it little by little to the neck of the bladder, then press upon it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place which you want to incise.
And you order a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and you order another servant to stretch with his right hand the labia upwards, and with his other hand to stretch the skin under the labia away from the place where the incision will be. Then take the sharp scalpel, whose image is this:
And incise between the anus and the labia, not in the middle, but towards the left buttock. The incision should be upon the stone itself, with your finger in the anus, and you press it outwards obliquely, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, to the extent that the stone can exit.
Not larger, for perhaps the finger which is in the anus will press the stone at the incision, and it will come out without difficulty. And know that there may be stones which have angles and edges, and therefore their exit is difficult.
And some are smooth, resembling an acorn and round, so their exit is easy.  But if any have angles and edges, then increase the incision slightly. If it does not come out like this, then it is necessary to devise a means, either to grasp it with a firm forceps, the end of which is like a file.
To hold the stone firmly so that it does not escape from it, or to insert under it a delicate instrument with a hooked end. If you cannot manage it, widen the incision slightly. If excessive bleeding overcomes you, stanch it with alum.
If there are more than one, push the largest first towards the opening of the bladder, then incise upon it, then push the smaller ones afterwards.  Do likewise if there are more than two. If it is very large, it is foolish to make a large incision upon it, because two things will happen to the patient.
Either he will die, or he will have a constant dribbling of urine, because the place will not heal at all. But try to push it until it comes out, or devise a means to break it with forceps until you remove it in pieces.
When you have finished your work, cauterize the wound with costus, aloes, and myrrh, and bind it, and place over it cloths moistened with oil and wine, or with rose oil and cold water, to calm the hot inflammation. Then let the patient lie on his back, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
When it is loosened, wash the place with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with palm-tree ointment and basil ointment until it heals. If excessive hot inflammation, suppuration, or the like appears in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder and preventing urination—which is known from the appearance of blood with the urine—
insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood; for if it remains, it will lead to corruption and decay of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type of condition with its appropriate treatment until it heals.
In all the treatments, it is necessary to bind and bring together the thighs to secure the medicines placed on the wound. If the stone is small and has settled in the urethra and obstructed the flow of urine, treat it with what I have described before it necessitates incision.
I have often dispensed with incision by means of this treatment, which I have tested. It is to take a probe of steel, of this form:
The end is triangular, sharp, and fixed in a rod. Then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, lest it return to the bladder. Then gently insert the probe into the urethra until the probe reaches the stone itself.
And turn the probe in the stone little by little, intending to pierce it until you pass through it to the other side; then the urine will flow immediately. Then press with your hand on what remains of the stone outside the penis, for it will crumble and come out with the urine, and the patient will be healed.
But if this treatment is not available to you because of some impediment, then tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then incise upon the stone in the penis itself between the two ties, and then remove it.
Then untie the ligature and clean away the clotted blood which has formed in the wound.  The reason for tying the thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder; the other ligature is above so that, when the thread is untied after the removal of the stone, the skin may return to its place and cover the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should draw the skin upwards so that it will return and cover the wound when you are finished, as we have said.
Chapter sixty-one.
On the removal of stones from women.
Stones are rarely formed in women; but if a woman should have a stone, its treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons. One is that the woman may be a virgin; another is that you will hardly find a woman who will allow herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is chaste or one of the women of the family, and thirdly, you will not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially in manual work; and fourthly, the incision for the stone in women is far from the location of the stone, therefore requiring a deep incision.
And in that there is danger. If necessity demands it, then a skilled woman physician should be sought; but such are rarely found. If you cannot find one, seek a chaste and gentle physician, or procure a skilled midwife experienced in women’s matters, or a woman who has some knowledge in this craft.
Then have her present and instruct her to do everything you command, beginning with the examination for the stone. That is to say, observe whether the woman is a virgin. If so, you should insert a finger into her rectum and search for the stone. If you find it and press on it with your finger...
then instruct her to make an incision. If she is not a virgin but a widow, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing firmly.
If she finds it, she should trace it from the mouth of the bladder downwards as far as she can reach, until she reaches the groin. Then, she should make an incision opposite the middle of the vulva, at the groin, on whichever side the stone is felt.
Her finger should not leave the stone, pressing on it. Let the incision be small at first; then insert the probe into that small incision. If she feels the stone, enlarge the incision as much as is needed for the stone to pass through. And know that there are many kinds of stones.
Some are small, some large; some smooth, some rough; some long, some round; some branched.  Know their types so that you may thereby understand what you are doing. If you are overwhelmed by blood, sprinkle powdered verdigris on the site and leave it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone comes out.  And make sure you have with you the instruments which I mentioned for removing stones from men, to assist you in your work. If you are overwhelmed by bleeding and you know from the throbbing of the blood that it is from a severed artery, then apply styptics to the site.
And bind it tightly with bandages, and leave it; do not disturb it, and leave the stone; do not remove it, for the patient might die. Then treat the wound. When the severity of the bleeding has subsided after a few days and the site has suppurated, return to your work until you remove the stone.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
On incision of the water bladder.
The water bladder is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testicle, and it is called the scrotum.  It may be in a special membrane prepared for it by nature in a part of the testicle.
So that one might think it is another testicle. It is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum which we mentioned. This only rarely occurs.  This bladder is generated from weakness affecting the testicles, so this material settles there. It may also result from a blow to the testicles.
This moisture is of many colors: it may be yellowish, or bloody red, or black and purulent, or white and watery – and this is the most common. The signs by which it is recognized are:
Where the water collects, if it is in the white peritoneum that we mentioned, the swelling is round, slightly elongated, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in a special membrane, then the swelling is round on one side of the testicle.
Therefore, one imagines that it is another testicle. If the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum, then it is palpable. But if you wish to know the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe, the image of which we have already presented.  Whatever comes out in the wake of the probe, you judge it according to what is inside.
If we proceed to treatment with the cautery, then you should order the patient to be bled if he is able and you see that his body is full. Then he should lie on his back on something slightly raised, with many cloths placed beneath him. Then you sit on his left.
And you order a servant to sit on his right, stretching his penis to one side of the scrotum and toward the groin. Then you take a wide scalpel and incise the skin of the scrotum in the middle lengthwise, almost to the pubis.
Make the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the scrotum in two, until you reach the white peritoneum which contains [the testicle]; then peel it back, being careful not to tear it.  Your peeling should be done more from the side which adheres to the testicle, and you should extend the peeling as much as you can.
Then widely incise the peritoneum full of water and remove all the water. Then separate the lips of the incision with hooks and stretch the peritoneum upwards, without touching the containing skin of the scrotum, and cut the peritoneum however you can cut it, either all at once or piece by piece.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not completely cut it, you cannot be sure that the water will not return. If the testicle protrudes from its skin during your work, then, when you have finished cutting the peritoneum, return it [to its place], then join the lips of the scrotum's skin with sutures.
Then treat it like any other wound until it heals. If you find the testicle is already spoiled by another disease, then you should ligate the vessels in the spermatic cord for fear of bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, then treat it as we have described.
If the collected water is in both sides, know that they are two hydroceles; incise the other side as you did the first, and if it is possible for you to do the work in one [operation], do so; then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool that you have soaked in oil or rose ointment, and place on the outside other wool soaked in a medicament and oil, and spread it over the testicles and the flanks of the abdomen, and place folded rags over it, which are the pledgets. And tie them from above with a bandage which has six ends, in this manner:
Then two rags are taken, sewn together, and stuffed with fluffy wool in this manner, and the ends used to bind it are made of wet cotton or wool, and gathered tightly in the waistband of the trousers, and one of the ends is taken to the buttocks towards the back.
And the second is taken towards the pubis, and the two ends to the thighs from below, and the remaining two ends to the groins, and all the tightening is gathered in the waistband of the trousers.  This hydrocele can also be treated with cautery instead of incision with an instrument.
It is that you take a gentle, knife-like cautery and with it incise the skin of the scrotum while it is hot, as we described, until the white peritoneum containing the water is exposed. Take another cautery of this shape:
It resembles the Greek eye, then cauterize that peritoneum with it while it is hot until all the moisture comes out. Then stretch the peritoneum with hooks and peel off the containing layer with the cautery, cutting it as much as you can until you excise it all, and take care that the testicle is not touched by the fire.
Know that this method is safer and less prone to bleeding, and better than the method of incision. If you encounter a hot swelling or bleeding or something else during the incision or cauterization, then you should treat whatever you encounter with the appropriate treatment, as previously mentioned.
If the patient is cowardly and does not endure this operation because of its unpleasantness, then let him use cautery as I describe, if it is confirmed by the signs we have previously mentioned.
If the hydrocele is watery, then the patient should sit on a raised chair, then cauterize the lower part of the swelling with a wide scalpel, and apply the cautery along the length of the body. Make the opening wide so that all the water flows out, then place cotton on the area and bind it.
Leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not come out during cauterization, and this is because the tunica albuginea obstructs the mouth of the wound and prevents the exit of water,
then you should insert a goose feather into the wound, or the instrument used to extract the water from the hydrocele, the image of which has been shown previously, or slightly enlarge the opening of the wound.
Know that the water may return and collect after six months or so. If it collects, cauterize it in the same manner, and the patient should take care of himself during those days.
Chapter sixty-three.
Concerning the incision on the fleshy membrane and its treatment.
Know that an incision on this membrane is one of the dangerous things leading to death in most cases; therefore, we see that it should be left alone and kept safe. I will, however, mention the procedure for treating it and the types of swelling.
I say that many swellings occur in the body, from which the two testicles are formed. This is due to many causes, either from a sharp humor flowing to the testicles, or from a blow. The color of the swelling is the color of the body, and it does not contain water.
The swelling may be soft, or it may be hardened, its color dark, and without sensation.  It may be from the complication and swelling of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from the swelling of the veins.  That which is from the swelling of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the swelling.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not be exposed at all. As for that which is from the swelling of the veins, nothing disperses from it when pressed with the fingers. This type may be incised, as well as other flesh.
And it is that you should incise the skin of the testicle, then extend the testicle upwards and bring it out from the white peritoneum, and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, and ligate the vessels and cut the spermatic cord after freeing it from every side of the testicle; if the testicle has adhered to those growing tissues.
Then it is necessary to remove and cut the testicle. And if the adhesion is between some of the peritonea or between the vessels, it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
If the growth of flesh is in the place of adhesion which is from behind, it is necessary to cut all of it and remove the testicle as we said. When your work is completed, dress the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Four.
In the treatment of hydrocele with a hernia.
A hernia is a twisted tumor, somewhat twisted, similar to a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking.  The treatment of this condition is similar to what has been mentioned previously.
However, it is necessary to mention the procedure as the ancients did. I say that it is necessary that the patient sit on a high chair, then push the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards, then grasp the skin of the scrotum with your fingers along with the vessels which are close to the penis.
And let your assistant hold it and stretch it tightly, then incise with a broad, sharp scalpel an oblique incision along the vessels until the vessels are exposed, then dissect from each side as I described to you in the dissection of the arteries in the armpits, then insert a needle with a doubled thread.
And tie it at the first place where the hernia appeared and tie it also at its end, then incise it in the middle with a vertical incision along the body and remove what has gathered in it of foul, putrid fluids.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds that you want to heal so that the vessels that nourish one of the testicles fall off; there is no harm in that.  If the hernia affects all the vessels, it is necessary to remove one of the testicles along with the vessels, lest the testicle lack nourishment. before cutting the vessels, lest they wither and become useless.
Chapter sixty-five.
In the treatment of intestinal hernia.
This hernia occurs from a tear that appears in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen near the groins from the abdominal cavity, and the intestine descends from that rupture into one of the testicles.
This rupture is either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its extension, and these two types occur from many causes, either a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting something heavy, and so on.  Its sign, if it is from the extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is even towards the depth because the peritoneum constricts the intestine. Its sign, if it is from a tear in the peritoneum, is that it causes great pain from the beginning suddenly, and the swelling is uneven, apparent under the skin nearby.
That is because the intestine exits and goes outside the peritoneum.  The omentum may also exit with the intestine; this hernia is then called intestinal and omental. It may also be with gas.  Feces may flow into the intestine and become trapped there, resulting in the patient's death.
Because it causes severe pain and gurgling, especially if constricted. Treatment of these types of ailments with cautery is dangerous; one should be wary of resorting to it.  The procedure is to instruct the patient to return the intestine into his abdomen by hand if it is possible to return it.
Then he lies on his back in your hands and raises his legs. Then you stretch the skin next to the groin upwards and incise all the skin of the scrotum lengthwise. Then you insert hooks into the edges of the incision, as much as is needed to open the incision with them.
The incision should be large enough to allow the testicle to emerge. Then you dissect the membranes under the skin of the scrotum until the white, hard peritoneum is exposed on all sides. Then insert your index finger next to the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum under the skin of the testicle and the second peritoneum, and you release the adhesions behind the testicle. Then, with your right hand, you pull inwards on the skin of the scrotum, while with your left hand you stretch the white peritoneum upwards and lift the testicle with the peritoneum towards the incision.
You instruct the assistant to pull the testicle upwards, and you completely release the adhesions from behind.  You explore with your finger lest there be something of the twisted intestine in the hard white peritoneum; if you find anything, push it down into the abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum under the scrotum skin next to the incision. Then cut the ends of the thread loop so that there are four threads. Then you overlap them firmly and tie the peritoneum, which we said is under the skin of the scrotum, tightly on two sides. Then you also twist the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing from the vessels that nourish it can reach them. Lest a hot swelling result from that, and make a second ligature outside the first ligature, less than two fingers away from it. After these two ligatures, leave the amount of a finger bone’s width of the peritoneum under the scrotum skin.
Lest a hot swelling result from that, and make a second ligature outside the first ligature, less than two fingers away from it. After these two ligatures, leave the amount of a finger bone’s width of the peritoneum under the scrotum skin. And cut all the rest in a circle and remove the testicle with it. Then make an incision at the bottom of the scrotum skin from which blood and pus will flow, as we described before. Then use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound and use the ligature which we described.
And one may cauterize the white peritoneum which we mentioned after cutting it, cautiously, because of bleeding, for this often happens. And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself; if it is slow to fall off, then loosen it with warm water and apply something that will make it sweat until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment of wounds until it heals.
Chapter sixty-six.
Concerning the windy hernia.  I have not seen anyone dare to treat this windy hernia with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described in the hernia with a sac, that is to say, that the vessels should be gently ligated below after the incision on it.
Then incise it in the middle and treat the tumor with what opens it until the vessels fall away, and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter sixty-seven.
Concerning the hernia which is in the groin.
A hernia may appear in the groin, as we said, so that the place swells and nothing of the intestine descends into the scrotum; and if it descends, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if time passes, the fissure in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and epiploon descend into the scrotum, and this occurs from the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin, as we said. That is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and the place swells and protrudes, and its treatment is by cauterization, as I have previously described.
And it may be treated with the cautery in this manner: the patient lies on his back between your hands, then you incise the swollen, protruding hernia horizontally to the extent of three fingers, then you separate the peritoneal membranes which are under the skin.
Until, when the white peritoneum which follows is uncovered, you take a probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then you sew the two protruding parts of the peritoneum to the end of the probe and join one to the other with the suture.
Then you remove the probe and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle nor anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then you treat it with the treatment of wounds.
If the threads are cut, I clean them and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the protrusion of the hernia does not increase.
And cauterization is better in this place because it is closer to safety.
Chapter sixty-eight.
On the relaxation of the skin of the scrotum.
Often the skin of the scrotum relaxes in some people without the flesh inside relaxing, and its appearance is unsightly.  He who wishes to treat it should place the patient on his back.
And he cuts all the relaxed skin on the thick skin, then brings the lips together. And if you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, and make sure of the stitching, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
For this reason, I should not have mentioned it in this book. However, I mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that it may be in the knowledge of the physician if he is asked about it, and so that he may know the treatment of one whom it has affected; and the other, that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Such as lambs, goats, cats, and the like of animals.  So I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by cutting.  That which is by crushing, its method is that we seat the animal in hot water until its testicles relax and soften and hang down.
Then crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are not perceptible to the touch. As for castration by cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie the suspensory ligaments and make one incision on each testicle.
Until, when the testicles appear, cut them after you have skinned them, and do not leave on them any of the membranes except the thin membrane which is on the vessels. This type of castration is better than that which is by crushing.
Because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal desires coitus. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
In the treatment of the hermaphrodite.
The hermaphrodite in men is of two types. One is that which appears in the area following the scrotum, or in the skin of the scrotum between the testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva, with hair, and urine may flow from that which is in the scrotum's skin.
But in women, there is one type, and it is above the vulva on the pubis like small male genitalia protruding outward; one of them is like a man's penis and the two are like testicles.  And the treatment of the three types.
The two types in men and the one type in women: it is necessary to cut away that excess flesh until its trace is removed, then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals.  But as for the second type in men, from which urine flows that is in the scrotum's skin, there is no action in it, nor is there any benefit from it at all.
Chapter seventy-one.
On the excision of the clitoris and the protruding flesh from the vulvas of women.
The clitoris may exceed the natural amount until it becomes large and its appearance is ugly, and it may become large in some women until it is spread like that of men and becomes suitable for intercourse.
Then you should grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with a hook and cut it, and do not exaggerate in the cutting, especially in the depth of the root, lest bleeding occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. As for the growing flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And it may protrude outwards like a tail. Therefore, some of the ancients call it the "tail disease."  Then you should cut it as you cut the clitoris, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter seventy-two.
In the treatment of prolapse.
Prolapse is when a woman's vagina is imperforate or the opening is small, and this is either natural, being present from birth, or accidental.  The accidental kind results from a previously existing condition, and it may be from an excess of growing flesh.
Or a thin or thick membrane, and it may be in the depth of the uterus, or in its sides, or above or below it.  It prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and sometimes menstruation.  Its identification is by the observation of the midwife.
If the obstruction is apparent and near, but if it is not apparent, then she should examine it with her fingers or with a probe. If the obstruction is from a thin membrane and is close to the labia, then proceed quickly to break it. This is done by placing something like pledgets on the labia, then placing both thumbs together.
The woman is on her back with her legs spread apart. Then she forcefully stretches the labia until the thin membrane is broken and the obstruction is opened. Then she takes wool, soaks it in oil, and places it on the location. The woman is to have intercourse every day so that the location does not close again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, then it should be incised with a broad scalpel resembling an aspen leaf. If the obstruction is from excess growing flesh, then suspend it with hooks and cut it.  Have with you styptics that do not sting, such as acacia, quince, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not close quickly. Keep it in place for several days and use a dry linen wick. Then treat it with the usual treatment for healing until it is healed.  There may be another growth of flesh in the uterus; it should be cut in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor.  A cancerous tumor in the uterus should never be treated with iron.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red sores that appear in the vulva of women.
As for hemorrhoids, it is a swelling of the mouths of the veins until much blood constantly flows from them. If the hemorrhoids persist, they become warts.  I have already mentioned their types and symptoms in the classification, and we will mention them here.
What accepts treatment and what does not accept treatment. I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep within the uterus and do not appear to the touch, cannot be treated with iron.  Those that are at the mouth of the uterus and can be felt are those that are treated.
Then the woman should enter a cool room, and then stretch the warts with a scraper or a rough cloth and cut them from their roots. Then apply to them, when the bleeding occurs, one of the styptics that stops the blood without causing injury.
Such as acacia,  [a plant whose name is similar to the word for]  "shiyan,"  frankincense, and the like. Then she should raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding continues, seat her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, gallnuts, and the like. Then take barley flour, and knead it with honey and vinegar.
And apply it as a compress to her back. If the bleeding stops, otherwise, apply cupping glasses to the loins and breasts without restriction. Then take wool, dip it in the juice of  tharthith, or the juice of  lamb's tongue, or the juice of the branches of al-‘illiq with a gallnut decoction, and apply it to the area.
When the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of entrails, rough in appearance.  What appears of it should be cut as I mentioned regarding warts, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
Concerning the suppuration which occurs in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, the stony tumor, ulcers, the polyp, the phagedenic ulcer, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and the hot tumor. I have described all these diseases, their types, and their signs in the classification.
It is necessary to mention in this chapter the hot tumor which occurs in the uterus, if it is among the tumors which collect for a time, how its suppuration is with iron.  One should look; if the pain of the tumor is initially severe, with throbbing, inflammation, and fever,
and you see it red when touched, do not hasten to its suppuration, and treat it with what helps in maturation until these symptoms subside. Then it is necessary that the woman sit on a chair with two seats and lean on its back.
and bring her legs together towards the lower abdomen, and her thighs should be spread apart, and her arms should be under her knees, and tie them with a suitable ligature.
Then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the mouth of the uterus is opened, the image of which comes later.  If you want to use this instrument, you should estimate with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus, lest what enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus.
This will harm the patient. If the instrument is longer than the depth, it is necessary to place pledgets on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus. The screw which runs in the instrument should be from the upper side.
And you hold the instrument, and the attendant turns the screw until the cervix is opened. When the abscess appears and is touched by the hand and is soft and thin, you should incise it at its head with a broad scalpel. Then, when all the matter is evacuated,
a soft tent soaked in rose oil or green oil containing some astringent should be placed in the wound. The tent should protrude from the incision in the cervix, and clean wool soaked in water in which althaea has been boiled should be placed externally on the uterus and pubis.
Then, after two days, treat with the ointment which is suitable for that until it heals.
And the uterus and wound may be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water in which liquorice root or long zedoary has been boiled, then return to the ointment, if the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
Then you should refrain from treating it with iron, but it should be treated as we mentioned in the section.
Chapter Seventy-Five.
In teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural way.
The midwife should first know the form of natural childbirth; its signs are: if you see the woman straining downwards and yearning to breathe the air, and what she is suffering from childbirth is eased.
And the emergence of the fetus is quick; know that this birth is in the natural way, and its emergence is head first with the placenta attached to it or hanging from its navel. If you see these signs, then you should press her belly so that the fetus emerges quickly.
For if it descends head first, the placenta descends with it and cleanses from those impurities a good cleansing. And other than this birth is unnatural and blameworthy, for the fetus may emerge on its feet and its hands may emerge before its head and feet.
And one hand or one foot, or its head and hand emerge, or it emerges folded, and perhaps it turns on its back, and similar blameworthy forms.  Therefore, the midwife should be skillful and gentle with all these things and beware of mistakes and errors.
And I am explaining each form and how to manage it so that you may be guided by that and understand it. If the fetus emerges head first – the natural emergence – and this is difficult for the woman and the labor is hard on her, and you see that her strength has weakened, then seat her on a chair and instruct women to hold her.
And pack her womb with cooked fenugreek and moist ointments, then the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers and cuts the placenta with it, or cuts it with her fingernail, until the moisture within flows out, and she presses the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then she should inject the woman with fenugreek saliva mixed with shirāj ointment, then after the injection, she should instruct her to strain and make her sneeze with a feather, holding her mouth and nose; then the fetus will emerge immediately. If the hands of the fetus emerge first, then they should be gently returned little by little.
If it does not manage to enter, then place the woman on a stool and raise her legs upwards, then shake the stool on the ground while the woman holds on so that she does not fall during the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, then cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them moderately; then he will come out.  The emergence of the fetus with its feet: If the fetus emerges with its feet, then they should be pushed upwards, then the fetus should be turned little by little until it is straightened, then one of its legs should be taken and extended little by little.
If they come out to the thighs, then instruct her to strain and make her sneeze with a feather; then it will come out. If it does not come out as described, then return the fetus little by little until it is in its natural position; then it will come out easily. If it is prevented by all that we have described,
Take some henbane saliva, fenugreek saliva, shirāj ointment, and dissolved gum, and pound them all well in a mortar, then apply it to the vulva of the woman and the lower part of her abdomen, then seat her in lukewarm water until it reaches the sharaṣīf.
If you see that her lower parts have softened, then make a pessary for her from myrrh and have her hold it. If the pessary remains for an hour, then seat her on a chair, then make her sneeze and close her mouth and nose, and gently squeeze her lower abdomen; then the fetus will come out immediately. The emergence of the fetus on its knees and hands:
If it comes out in this manner, then gradually insert your hands, then the woman should lie on her back and let her hips hang down while lying on a bed, and clasp her hands, then gently squeeze above her abdomen. Then remove the cushions from under her legs so that her lower parts are elevated. If the fetus does not come out, then take both her legs and move them vigorously, then gently squeeze above the sharaṣīf until the fetus ascends upwards, then the midwife inserts her hand and straightens the fetus little by little.
And tell the woman to strain until the fetus comes out.  The emergence of the fetus sideways, hanging by one of its hands:  gradually work to return its hand. If you are not able to return it, then have the woman stand and walk; if she is unable to walk, then have her lie down...
...on her bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then use the poultice that I described from the saliva. If labor pains seize her, then seat her on a chair, then work to return the hand and straighten the fetus into its natural form, and make the woman sneeze and tell her to strain until it comes out.
The emergence of the fetus on its back, extending its hands, and its face towards its mother's back: the midwife should grasp the hand of the fetus, then turn it little by little and straighten it gently.  When it is straight, then apply to its head what we described of the fat and poultices.
Then tell her to move little by little. If she does that, then seat her on a chair and tell her to lean to her right side. Then tell her to strain and make her sneeze with the [nasal] speculum, for then it will come out.  The emergence of the fetus upright on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the womb in this manner with the placenta, then tear the placenta with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture.  If it is attached to the face and neck of the fetus, then cut it from the umbilical cord lest it be strangled and die; then push the fetus inwards until it is as it should be.
And tell the woman to strain repeatedly, for then it will come out easily. The emergence of twins or many fetuses: know that twins are frequently born, and three or four may be born and live, although that is rare; as for five, it is something outside of nature, they do not live at all.
And they are surrounded, even if numerous, by a single placenta, and they are separated by a membrane-like partition between them, connected to the umbilical cord of each one. And they may emerge like a single fetus, in a natural and easy manner; and they may emerge in a blameworthy manner, as we have described.
If some of them are difficult at birth and come to what we have mentioned of unnatural forms, then treat them as we have described.  And let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and slowness, and contrive for every form with whatever means are available to her that lead to safety.
Mentioning what is conceived in the womb of fetuses that are aborted: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the womb. It has been confirmed to me that a woman aborted seven, and another fifteen, all conceived.
By the estimation of the All-Knowing and All-Mighty, all of this should be in the knowledge of the midwife, for perhaps such a thing may occur to her one day, and she may deal with it as is appropriate.
Chapter Seventy-Six.
On the extraction of the dead fetus.
If you treat the dead fetus with what I mentioned in the division of treatment and it does not come out, and the matter necessitates using the hand, then you should look: if the woman is strong and healthy and does not have any of the symptoms from which death is feared, then the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
And her head should be tilted downwards and her legs raised, and a servant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, lest her body be pulled when the fetus is extracted.
Then moisten her vagina with moist ointments along with mallow and fenugreek saliva and flaxseed, then the midwife should anoint her hand with these ointments and saliva, then gently insert it into the uterus, then search with it for a place to hook the fetus with the hooks, and the suitable places for that.
Look, if the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst, then insert the hooks into its eyes or the back of its head or its mouth or its palate or under its chin or its clavicle or in the places near the ribs or under the cartilages.
But if its descent is feet first, then in the pubis and the middle ribs.  The hook should be held in the right hand, its bend between the fingers of the left hand, and the hand should be gently inserted, and a hook inserted into some of those places we mentioned.
Until you reach something empty, then insert another hook opposite it, or a third if needed, so that the traction is even and does not lean to one side, then pull with a steady pull, and the pull should not be straight only, but moved to each side.
So that its exit is facilitated, as is done with a tooth when it is extracted.  Between these actions, the pull should be relaxed. If it is obstructed from one side, the midwife should anoint some fingers with ointment and insert them from that side to move what is obstructed. If part of the fetus emerges, then move the hooks to other places.
It is slightly raised, doing this until the entire fetus emerges. If a hand emerges before anything else and cannot be returned because of compression, then a cloth should be wrapped around it and pulled until, when it has entirely emerged, it is cut.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow.  Thus should you act with the other hand and with the feet. If the head of the fetus is large and experiences pressure during its exit, or if there is collected water in its head, then a hooked scalpel should be inserted between the fingers.
And the head is incised with it so that the water emerges, or it is drawn out with the instrument called the *mishdaq*, the image of which, along with the images of the other instruments, comes in the chapter after this one.
Similarly, if the fetus is naturally large-headed, then the skull should be incised or crushed with the *mishdaq*, as we said, then the bones removed with the hooks. If the head emerges and is compressed at the clavicle, then it should be incised until the moisture in the chest flows out.
Then the chest will contract. If the chest does not contract and egress is not achieved, then cut as much as you are able. If the lower abdomen is swollen or has a tumor, then it should be incised so that the moisture flows out.
If the fetus is in a breech position, then pulling it out is easy, and straightening it towards the uterine os is simple. If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, then it should be pulled with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and the abdomen or chest should be incised so that what is inside flows out.
If all the members are extracted and the head is retracted and retained, let the midwife insert her left hand. If the uterine os is open, let her insert her hand into the cervix and seek the head with it, and pull it with her fingers to the uterine os. Then she inserts one or two hooks and pulls it out with them.
If the uterine os is constricted by a hot tumor that has occurred, then it should not be forced.  Rather, then it is necessary to use the pouring of moist, fatty substances and to use poultices, and to sit in waters that relax and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, if it can be straightened, then what we mentioned for the living fetus should be used. If this is not possible, then it should be cut and removed.  Nothing of the placenta should be left inside at all. When you have finished your treatment, use what we mentioned concerning the treatment of hot tumors that occur in the uteri.
If hemorrhage occurs, let her descend into astringent waters and use all other treatments. I have witnessed a woman who had conceived, and the fetus died in her womb, then she conceived again upon it.
Then the other fetus also died. After a long time, a tumor appeared in her uterus, and it swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not close. Then I applied some strong, drawing ointments to it.
Then a bone came out of the place. Then days passed, and another bone came out. I was amazed by this, since the abdomen is not a place where bones are found. I judged that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.  So I examined the wound and removed many bones from the skull of the fetus from it.
I continued doing this until I removed many bones from her, and the woman was in the best of health.  And she lived like that for a time, discharging a little pus from the place. And I have presented here this rare case.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skillful physician attempts with his hand in treatment.
Chapter seventy-seven.
In it are images of the instruments needed for removing the fetus.
Image of a screw to open the mouth of the womb.
This is the instrument which is used to set books straight; it has two screws at the ends of the two pieces of wood, except that this screw should be finer than the instrument and should be either of ebony or boxwood, and the width of each piece of wood should be the thickness of two fingers.
And their width is about a finger and their length is a span and a half, and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two runners of the same kind of wood which are fastened in them; their length is half a span or a little more, and their width is about two fingers or a little more, and these two runners...
are those which enter the mouth of the womb to open it when you turn the screws; an image of another instrument for the same purpose, finer and lighter.
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, except that it has two runners at its end, as you see; the length of each runner is about a span, and their width is two fingers; and if you wish to open the womb with it,
then seat the woman on a bed with her legs hanging down, spread apart between her thighs, then insert these two runners gently into the mouth of the womb, while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs, then open your hand with the instrument as you do with hooks, as much as you want to open the womb. until the midwife does what she wants.  An image of another screw mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument which pushes the fetus.
Image of the forceps with which the head of the fetus is grasped.
It resembles scissors, it has teeth at the end as you see, and it may be made rectangular like hooks, in this image as you see, it has teeth like the teeth of a saw, it cuts with it and crushes.
Image of a pusher also.
Image of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so that it does not break when the fetus is pulled with it. Image of a hook with two barbs.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more numerous their types and the better prepared by the craftsman, the quicker his work and the higher his reputation among people. Therefore, do not disdain any instrument to have ready, for there is bound to be need for it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
On the removal of the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold herself, then cause her to sneeze with a sternutatory [powder] and press your hand on her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out in this way, well and good; otherwise, take a measure.
And pierce a hole in the lid and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as rue, henbane, dill, chamomile, wormwood, marshmallow, and centaury—all these medicaments or some of them—and immerse them in water and place them on the fire. Then you place a silver tube on the hole in the lid of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb.
And hold it until the vapor reaches the bottom of the womb, then cause her to sneeze as we said. Then the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in goose grease or mallow juice.
Then she inserts it into the vagina and searches for the placenta. If she finds it, she grasps it and pulls it out little by little. If it is attached deep in the womb, insert the hand as we described, until you find the placenta, then pull it little by little towards the vulva.
Lest the womb fall out with strong pulling, but it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then the amount of pulling is increased. Then it will yield and be freed from adhesion. If the mouth of the womb is constricted, we have described the treatment with sneezing and the treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, beware of violence upon it in pulling again.  But it is necessary to tie what has come out of it to the mouth of the womb to the woman's thigh, then inject it with the quaternary ointment, for it will cause it to rot after a few days.
And it will dissolve and come out.  However, if it becomes putrid, a bad smell will rise from it to the stomach and head, and this will harm the patient, so it is necessary to use suitable fumigation.
Therefore, some of the ancients tried the fumigation of rue and dried figs.  The image of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated when menstruation and the placenta are retained, and so on:
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or it is made of copper. The thin end is placed in the vagina, and the wide end over the fire, and the incense is placed on the coals.  It is held until that incense is gone, and then another is added.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
In the treatment of the non-perforated rectum.
Many boys are born with their rectums imperforate; a thin membrane closes it.  The midwife should pierce this membrane with her finger; otherwise, let her incise it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then she should apply wool soaked in wine and oil, and then treat it with ointments until it heals. If she fears that it will close, she should place a lead tube in the opening for many days and remove it whenever the child wants to defecate.
The rectum may also become obstructed by the healing of a wound or a tumor; this adhesion should be incised, and then treated as previously described, with the lead tube.
Chapter Eighty.
On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower parts.
Fistulas that occur in the lower parts are a complication and thickening that occurs near the anus, externally or internally, from one side or another. The fistula may be single or multiple.
If this complication becomes chronic, it opens and a watery white fluid or thin pus discharges from it.  Some of these fistulas may penetrate to the bladder and to the intestine, while others may not. Penetrating fistulas can be identified by the passage of feces and flatus from them when the patient defecates.
Worms may also emerge from them.  There may be fistulas, if they are internal, that penetrate to the bladder and to the urethra.  Some may penetrate to the hip joint and to the sacrum. A fistula penetrating to the rectum can also be distinguished from one that does not.
You should insert your index finger into the rectum and insert a thin probe of copper or iron into the fistula, if the fistula is not tortuous. If it is tortuous, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair into it.
Until you feel the probe or hair with your finger. If you do not feel it at all, and nothing—feces, flatus, or worms—emerges from the opening as we have said, then know that it is not penetrating; proceed to treatment.
If the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary passage, the sign is the passage of urine from it, and the inability of the site to heal with medication.  If it penetrates to the hip joint or to the sacrum, the sign is the probe reaching there.
If there is no tortuosity to the bone, and pain is present in that area, and pus constantly emerges from it, and treatment is ineffective and it does not heal with ointment, these penetrating fistulas are incurable.
And their treatment is a vain effort for those ignorant physicians who attempt it. As for those that are not penetrating and are not chronic, recovery is hoped for with cautery, as I will describe and as I have tested.  This is that the patient should lie on his back between your hands.
And he should raise his legs, and his thighs should be inclined towards his abdomen. Then insert the copper or lead probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel with your finger that the probe has penetrated by itself, uncovered, without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is penetrating, so do not exert yourself on it, for there is no cure for it, as we said.
And they have said that it heals in some people rarely. And of the treatments which are hoped to be effective is that you heat a thin cautery iron according to the size of the fistula, as mentioned before, and insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches towards the anus, then repeat it two or three times.
Until you know that all that excess, matted flesh resembling a bird's quill has been burnt. Then treat it with lint soaked in butter until the burnt flesh comes out. Then treat it with healing ointments, if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment. But if you insert the probe and it does not penetrate to your finger which is in the anus, and there was a thick partition of flesh or membrane between it and the probe, and you see the fistula near the surface of the skin, then incise the skin at the beginning of the fistula. And you pass with the incision with the probe while it is in the fistula until you reach with the incision where the end of the probe ends, and the probe becomes free and falls out. Then you clean out that matted flesh which resembles a bird's quill tube and leave nothing of it.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the blood overwhelms you and prevents you from cutting that flesh, the best and quickest remedy is cauterization with fire or a strong medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two good things: burning that excess flesh.
And cutting the blood and drying the moisture. Then treat it with lint soaked in butter or sulfur powdered with oil until the area suppurates and that burnt flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that grow firm flesh.
These are medicines that constrict and dry, for if it is closed, it has healed and there is no fear of recurrence. If the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is distant from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the anus and explore with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it a membrane of peritoneum or flesh and it is near to penetration, then the action in it is only by way of hope, that is, that you use one of three methods: either cauterize it as we said.
Or incise it until you reach its bottom so that you are able to insert the lint and treat it from near. Do not go too far with the incision lest you cut the muscle surrounding the anus and cause the patient to involuntarily pass stool. Then treat it as we mentioned, and perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or penetrate that membrane and pierce it after incising it near the anus as we said, either with a probe or another sharp-pointed instrument. Then clean all the adherent flesh in the incision as far as you can thoroughly.
Then sew up the whole wound, including the incision and the upper opening, until it closes, leaving the fistula open inside the anus, which will be easier for the patient.  The fistula may be perforated in this manner.
And if you insert the probe into the fistula and it is on a side of the anus toward the surface of the body with the skin and the anus's ring, then take a probe with a perforated tip like a shoemaker's needle, in this manner:
And insert into it a twisted thread of five or so threads, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom, if it is penetrating into the margin of the anus from the inside nearby.
Then bring out the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and bringing out the end of the thread. Bring the two ends together and tighten them, and leave it for a day or two.  Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads is severed and falls off. Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, penetrate it however you can, except that it should not be too deep, for you should not do that because of the muscle, lest you cut it. Then do with it as we have mentioned until it heals.
The image of the hooked scalpel with which fistulas are incised: its curvature is very sharp, and the other side is not sharp, lest you cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter eighty-one.
Concerning the opening of hemorrhoids from which blood flows, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the rectum, resembling red bladders or like grapes, and there are small and large ones, and blood constantly flows from them.
And they may be one or many, and they may be outside the rectum and at its edges, except that those which are outside the rectum are, in most cases, less moist, with a yellowish fluid or a little blood constantly flowing from them, and they are the color of the body.
The treatment of those which are inside the rectum is that you order the patient to strain and bear down until the rectum protrudes and the growths appear to you. Then you quickly grasp them with hooks or seize them with your fingernail and then cut them at their bases. If the hooks do not hold because of their moisture and laxity,
then rub them with a rough cloth or a piece of a rasping file, or pull them with your fingers, then cut them, and then sprinkle on them after cutting some sharp powders to act as a cautery, or cauterize them as described in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with the other treatments until it heals. If the rectum does not protrude, then inject the patient with an enema containing a little stimulant to wash what is in the rectum and facilitate its rapid protrusion when the patient strains. As for the growths outside the rectum, their treatment is easy and simple.
That is, you grasp it with your fingernail or hook it with a hook and cut it, then treat it as we have mentioned until it heals. And whoever dislikes cutting with iron, then he should use a ligature in this manner: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the wart upward and pass the needle through its base from the other side, and twist the ends of the thread below the needle while it is crosswise, and pull the wart tightly, then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this to all the warts, leaving one unligated.
so that the excess blood flows from them, then place on the rectum a cloth soaked in rose oil or kypriot oil and place it on the rectum, and tell the patient to be still, then leave him until they fall. When the warts fall, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often result from dryness of the stool and retention of the temperament. If it becomes chronic and medicine does not work, then it should be scraped with a lancet or your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper crust that prevents its healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals as it should. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more forcefully than the first time until it bleeds well and peels, then treat it; for it will heal.
Chapter eighty-two.
On the treatment of ingrown and non-ingrown nails, dry warts and the ant.
A nail is a round nodule, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail; it occurs on the whole body, especially on the soles of the feet and the toes, and causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to incise around the nail, grasp it with a hook or a forceps, and remove it from its root, then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it as was previously described in its chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, matted, round protrusion on the surface of the body.
They often appear on the hands of children.  Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it, or pierce it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off; and if you wish, cauterize it as previously described with fire or a caustic medicine.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts may be removed with the instrument which I have described in the treatment of the ant. As for the ant, it is also a small, matted, thick protrusion on the surface of the body, going very deep; and if it is exposed to cold, one feels in it something similar to the sting of ants.
It occurs on the whole body, but most often on the hands.  Its treatment is to take a tube made of a strong goose feather or eagle feather, and place this tube on the ant until the circumference of the tube surrounds it on all sides, then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the ant.
Then push it into the depth of the flesh, and the ant will be removed from its root. And if you wish, do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:
The upper part of the tube should be solid and twisted to facilitate gripping and twisting it with the fingers. And if you wish, cauterize the ant as previously described in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
On the forms of instruments used for injections in cases of rectal disorders, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, china, or cast or beaten copper.  These instruments may be made small or large, according to the users. Those used in the treatment of small children should be small, and those for patients with narrow or painful rectums should be very gentle. Image of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel, to which the bladder is tied, is wide in this manner, having a partition where the bladder is tied, as you see, and its lower end, which enters the rectum, is solid, very smooth, and thin; on one side are two holes, and on the other, one hole.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of a gimlet, or a little thicker. The bladder, in which the medicine is placed, is made from an animal's bladder or sheepskin, shaped like a small flask, its diameter being a cubit.
It is pierced with many holes, in a circular pattern, the distance between each hole being the thickness of a finger. Then a tight thread of twisted yarn, made of ten threads or so, is inserted into these holes, and the bladder is gathered together like a flask. Then, when the medicine is placed inside, it is tightly bound in the head of the syringe between two stones, and then injected. This is an image of the circle of the bladder and the hole:
The method of injection is to fill the skin or bladder with warmed medicine, to a degree the patient can tolerate. Beware of it being excessively hot or cold.  Then the patient lies on his back and raises his legs upwards.
A cloth or blanket is placed beneath him. Then the end of the syringe is lubricated with oil, egg white, fenugreek saliva, or the like. Then it is gently inserted into the rectum. Then the attendant takes the bladder in both hands and squeezes it firmly until all that is in the syringe is emptied into the intestine.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs to the wall. If the medicine stimulates evacuation, let him restrain himself as much as possible. If he sleeps with it all night, it will be more effective. If it is injected for diarrhea and its exit is hastened, then repeat the injection until he recovers.
If there are painful hemorrhoids or tumors in the rectum, let the syringe be very delicate and smooth, smoother than those used to inject children.  This is an image of a delicate syringe with skin stretched over it:
Chapter Eighty-Four
On the Treatment of Wounds.
I have mentioned in the classification the treatment of things similar to cauterizations, and I now mention here their treatment by hand and by medicines completely. I say that wounds differ according to the thing causing the wound and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The things that cause wounds are many, such as the blow of a stone, or a cut by a sword or knife, or a stab by a lance, or a stick, or an arrow, and so on from many things.
And as for wounds according to the locations on the body, such as the wound that occurs on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the abdomen, or the liver, and similar organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a measure and rule for all wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds especially because the compound ones will be mentioned in the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
I say that when a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone, I look; if it is from the blow of a stone or the like, and only the skin has been split, and the wound is large, and I fear for the patient the occurrence of hot inflammation, then I hasten and incise the scalp in the appropriate place. And do not delay that, and let blood be drawn from him according to his strength if nothing prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood coming out of the wound is little, and let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded area.
And warn the patient against fullness, and thick drinks and foods; if something prevents his bloodletting, then let him reduce food and not approach meats or drinks, and apply to the wound, if hot inflammation occurs in it, cotton soaked in rose oil alone or with a drink that contains astringency.
And if you are safe from hot inflammation, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh and the air has not altered it, the  powder which I describe to you shortly; but if the air has altered it, then apply some ointments to it.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals; if the wound is large and is from the cut of a sword or the like, and its edges do not come together with plasters, then join it with sutures as I describe in the suturing of abdominal wounds.
If the skin exposes the bone and hangs down, and its attachment is only in a small ligament, then cut it, then treat the wound with medicines that produce solid flesh in place of the skin, and order the patient to nourish himself with foods that contain strength, such as heads and pastes, and the like.
If decay occurs in the skin and does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all that is decayed and throw it away, then treat it; if in these wounds there is an artery or vein that bleeds, and the bleeding is not stopped by medicines, then search for the artery.
If you find it and it is not severed, then sever it with a scalpel and tie it; and if necessity requires it, if what we mentioned does not work, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, then their treatment is easy; it suffices to treat them by sprinkling on them this powder while they are still bleeding.
Before the air changes it. The preparation of the powder is that one part of frankincense, two parts of acacia, and three parts of slaked or unslaked lime are taken; all are ground, sifted, and the wound is packed with it and bound tightly until it adheres well.
It congeals with the blood, then bind it from above with bandages and leave it; do not unbind it as long as it does not swell, for the medicine does not separate from it until it heals.  The lime alone may do this if you do not have frankincense and acacia.
This action may also be done with alum in many large wounds if its application and binding are expertly done, and the wounds are fresh with blood, before the air changes them, but if the air has changed them somewhat, especially in summer.
Then there is no point in applying this powder; treat it with what we have mentioned, by applying some ripening ointments or a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey until pus forms, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
But if a fracture occurs with the wound, and it is slight, then draw it with a splint.  I have described the treatment of head fractures in what follows, in the surgery of the neck; if the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a head wound if it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy other than to avoid treating it with things that cause strong constriction, such as verdigris, vitriol, and the like, because they injure the nerve and cause it to spasm.
Nor should anything cold be placed on the wound, because the substance of the nerve is cold and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs; and what you treat it with should be soft medicines, such as finely ground litharge washed with fresh water several times, moistened with oil or rose ointment and tutty.
If it is also washed with fresh water and other minerals in this manner, and moist ointments, but if the wound is large, use stitching or bind its edges with compresses, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has depth and a cavity forms at its bottom where pus collects, lance it in its lowest part; if an artery has been severed in the wound and you see its blood flowing, ligate it or cauterize it, or if necessary, amputate it.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx, but the windpipe is unharmed, join the edges of the skin by stitching over the windpipe; do not touch the windpipe itself, but smooth it and restore it to its natural shape, then tie it tightly and leave it for some days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals; if the wound has affected the bone, explore it; if there are bone splinters, extract them all, or as many as possible; what you cannot reach, leave until the wound suppurates and heals, making their removal easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle on it the powder we have described; if a bone becomes carious in the wound and forms a fistula, treat it according to what will be mentioned in its chapter, in the surgery of the chest and between the shoulders.
If it is a wound from a spear or knife, and you see it has depth, observe it; if air comes out of it when the patient breathes, know that it is a mortal wound; if it does not have depth and is fresh, bleeding, do not initially apply powder to it, nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be retained in its depth.
It will then retreat to the heart and kill the patient; but place on it an attractive ointment, and dress it twice a day; if you do not have ointment, put old cotton in the mouth of the wound to absorb the moisture that comes from it, and have the patient sleep on the wound.
so that what collects in it may flow out; and if three days or more have passed since the infliction of the wound, and the patient has not suffered convulsions, a bad pulse, or shortness of breath, and you see that his other conditions are good, know that the wound is safe, so treat it with cauterization and other treatments until it heals.
If its visibility is difficult and the discharge is continuous, know that it has become a fistula, and treat it in its chapter; the patient should lie on the wound so that what collects in it may flow out, and if the wound is in the chest or back, treat it with the stitching described above.
If it is large, cauterize it; if it is small, use powders.  If it has affected the bone and broken off pieces of it, explore the wound and promptly remove those fragments if they are free; if they are not free, leave them until...
the wound becomes foul, for then it will be easy to remove them. As for other wounds occurring in other members, their treatment is governed by what we have mentioned.
Chapter eighty-five.
On wounds of the abdomen, the protrusion of the intestines, and their suturing.
The rupture which occurs in the abdomen may be large, or it may be small or medium.  A large rupture may allow the exit of one or several intestines, and their replacement and suturing will be more difficult and arduous.
A small rupture may also be difficult in another way, and its reduction may be more arduous.  If the intestine is not immediately returned to its place, it swells and thickens, making its replacement difficult. For this reason, the medium-sized rupture is preferable, because its reduction is not as difficult as in the other two types.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen is of four types. Two sutures are general, suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing all other wounds of the body. The other two sutures are special, applicable to all wounds, but they are particularly suitable for suturing the abdomen.
And I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification. I say that if the wound is small and some of the intestine has protruded and its replacement is difficult, this is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said, or because the intestine has been previously inflated by the entry of air.
If this is so, then it should be warmed by immersing a sponge or a wet cloth in lukewarm water alone, or in water in which dill, rue, and spikenard have been boiled, and applying it to the intestine until the inflation subsides.
A styptic drink may also do this, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.  When you see the inflation has subsided, moisten the intestine with water in which either quince or borage has been boiled, for this will make its entry easier.
If its return is still impossible after this treatment, make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument used to incise fistulas. The first treatment, if successful, is better than the incision.  Recourse to incision is only taken after necessity and failure of other methods. This is the image of the instrument:
One side of it is curved and pointed, the other side is not pointed. The thin end is not as sharp as a scalpel, but is slightly blunt. It is an instrument similar to a small forceps, as you see. If the wound is wide and the intestine has entered, then it should be returned to its natural shape.
Its proper place, if you can manage it, is best. But if the rupture is wide and is in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back with his legs higher than his head; if it is in the upper abdomen, his head and chest should be higher than his lower body.
Similarly, if the rupture is on one side of the abdomen, always aim to keep the side with the surgery higher than the other. This should be done in major and moderate surgeries.
As for minor surgeries, place him as you are able. Then have a skilled assistant ready to hold the entire rupture with both hands, bringing its edges together, then revealing it to the suture-worker, little by little.
This is the description of a single general suture:  Take a needle, or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Then leave a space at the end of the rupture equal to the thickness of the little finger, and pierce with a single needle, without thread, through both edges of the skin. along with the edges of the peritoneum beneath the skin from the inside, until you pass through on that side.  Having brought together the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, making four layers, then tie a doubled thread around the needle several times on both sides until the edges of the wound are firmly joined.
Then leave a space equal to the thickness of a finger, and insert another needle, then fasten it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with as many needles as you need, until you complete the entire circumference of the wound. Let the needles be of moderate thickness.
Because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin, therefore they should be of moderate thinness and thickness.  And the needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too close to the seam.
lest the flesh quickly tear and the wound open before it heals; nor should you be too far apart with the stitches lest the wound be prevented from uniting. Then cut off the ends of the needles lest they harm the patient when he sleeps, and make him pads of linen scraps on each side to hold the ends of the needles.
And leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of stitching with needles is best suited for small wounds, because one or two needles, or thereabouts, may suffice for stitching them.
As for the method of stitching for a second type of wound, it is to gather together with the stitching the four edges, namely the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, all at once with a needle threaded with a twisted thread of moderate thinness and thickness. Then, when you have passed the needle through these four edges, return the needle to the side from which you began.
So that the thread falls interwoven from the top of the wound, so that the stitching is according to the stitching of a purse which is tightened with it, making the space between each stitch the thickness of the little finger.  This stitching is known to all people.
With this stitching, I stitched a wound which appeared on a man in his abdomen; he had been wounded with a knife, and the opening of the wound was more than a span, and about two spans of the middle intestine had protruded, and the opening was in the middle of the abdomen.
I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he was cured, and he lived many years thereafter, managing all his affairs.  The physicians had judged that he would never recover at all.
And it is remarkable that I did not treat him with ointment, because I was in a place where there were no medicines. I used to place worn cotton on the wound twice a day and attend to washing it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two types of special stitching, I mention it according to the words of Galen: that you begin the stitching from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside; then, when the needle has passed through the skin and the muscle, going straight along the whole length of the abdomen...
...leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side into which you inserted the needle, and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, into the other edge of the peritoneum. Then, when you have passed it through, pass it again through this same edge of the peritoneum from outside to inside.
And leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, and as you pass it through, pass it also through the edge of the peritoneum on its side, until you pass it through all of it.
Then begin again from this same side and sew it together with the edge of the peritoneum on the other side, and bring the needle out of the skin near it; then return it into that skin and sew the edge of the peritoneum on the other side together with this edge of the peritoneum.
And bring it out of the skin on its side, and do that again and again, one time after another, until you sew up the whole wound in that way. The general description of this stitch is that it is sewn like the sewing of furs for furriers.
That you sew the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leave it once from the other side until you finish. As for the second type of special stitch which Galen also mentioned, this is his exact wording:
It is that you sew it in the manner that some practitioners sew it, by bringing together each part to its counterpart which naturally matches it; thus they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and this is done as I describe to you.
It is necessary that you insert the needle into the edge of the peritoneum nearest to you from the outside, and pass it to the inside in it alone, and leave the edges of the peritoneum; then return the needle and pass it from the outside to the inside in both edges of the peritoneum; then return it again.
And pass it from the inside to the outside in the other edge of the peritoneum which is on the opposite side. This type of stitch is better than the easy common stitch, which is the stitch previously mentioned. This is Galen's exact wording.  Some have said that the suturing of the abdomen may be straightened with two needles. That is, you insert into them one thread, and begin by inserting the needle from your side and pass it to the other side, and insert the other needle from the opposite side, and pass it from your side, according to the stitching of the saddle-bags equally.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, then its stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its rule in its treatment is the rule of all other wounds; that is, if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and you return the intestines and sew it up and tighten it, then apply to it the medicated pledgets.
If the wound has been changed by the air, then apply to it some of the ointments that you prepare until it suppurates and the stitches fall out and the peritoneum and the mesentery unite; then treat it as you treat all other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines, apply to it from the time it begins to suppurate, old cotton, and change it twice a day as I have taught you, until it heals. For you do not need other treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple.  If you fear that the wound will involve the principal organs in pain,
Then it is necessary to dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and the armpit. If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines – for this often happens – then inject him with a lukewarm, astringent, black drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and become a penetrating wound into its cavity. And know that what is thick of the intestines is easier to heal, and what is thin of them is more difficult to heal.
And as for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not at all accept healing from a wound that occurs in it, because of the multitude of its veins and their size, and the thinness of its substance and its proximity to the nature of the nerve. But if what emerged from the wound is omentum and you find it moist, then return it in the same way that you return the intestine.
If a period of time passes and it has turned green or black, then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place that has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for in the omentum are veins and arteries; then cut below that ligature.
And leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound, outside of it, so that it is easy for you to remove and extract it when the omentum falls off and the wound suppurates.  [Description of a wound occurring in the intestine:] But if a perforation occurs in the intestine and it is small…
it is possible that it will heal in some people; for I saw a man who had been wounded in his abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach.  The wound festered and became a fistula from which feces and wind emerged; so I treated him, although I did not hope for his healing. And I continued to treat him until he healed and the place joined. When I saw that the place had joined, I feared for the patient that a bad incident would occur in his abdomen, but no bad incident whatsoever occurred to him, and he remained in the best of conditions. He rightly eats, drinks, copulates, enters the bath, and exerts himself in his service.  And some experienced people have mentioned that whenever a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be sutured in this manner.
And it is that large-headed ants are taken, then the edges of the wound are brought together, and then one of them, with its mouth open, is placed on the edges of the wound.  When it grasps and tightens its mouth, its head is cut off, for it adheres and does not come undone. Then another ant is placed near the first.
And you continue to do this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then you return it and sew the wound, for those heads remain adhering in the intestine until the intestine heals and recovers, and no harm whatsoever befalls the patient. And it is also possible to sew the intestine with fine thread.
Which is drawn from the intestine of an animal adhering to it after it is inserted into a needle; and that is that the end of this thread is taken from the intestine, then it is smoothed, then a thin twisted linen thread is tied to its end, then that thread is inserted into the needle. And in it is the intestinal thread, and with it the intestine is sewn, then it is returned to the abdomen. And this type of suturing with ants and intestine is only a matter of hope and expectation.
But if the perforation is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, then there is no remedy and no healing at all.
Chapter eighty-six.
In the treatment of catarrh and fistula.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and prolonged and becomes an ulcer and does not heal, and constantly discharges pus that does not stop, is generally called, in whatever member it may be, a fistula; and we call it a catarrh, and a fistula.
It is in reality a hardened, matted, white mass, with no pain associated with it; it has a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather; and it is sometimes moist, constantly discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture may cease; and this moisture may be abundant or scanty, thick or thin.
And I have already mentioned in the classification, when describing wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal and in which flesh does not grow, is so because of one of nine reasons; one of these is either because of a deficiency of blood in the body, or because of its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside it and on its edges, preventing the growth of good flesh. Or because it is very painful and dirty; or because the ulcer itself is foul and the matter it discharges is of poor quality; or because the treatment is unsuitable; or because of a corruption that has occurred in the region, of the nature of an epidemic; or because of a peculiarity of the region.
Or because it is very painful and dirty; or because the ulcer itself is foul and the matter it discharges is of poor quality; or because the treatment is unsuitable; or because of a corruption that has occurred in the region, of the nature of an epidemic; or because of a peculiarity of the region. As was evident in the city of Saragossa, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is naturally slow; or because there is one or several bones in it. I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the classification.
It is necessary for me here to inform you of the treatment of fistulas and abscesses which are treated by hand surgery. Know that fistulas may occur in all parts of the body; some of them reach large veins and arteries, or a nerve.
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of the composite joints, such as the hand and foot; and some lead to the vicinity of a principal organ, and so on.
Then, those fistulas of this kind are among the difficult-to-cure diseases which do not accept treatment, and working on them is laborious and ignorant.  If there are fistulas which have not reached these places which I have mentioned, I hope and trust in their treatment.
And if you wish to arrive at the knowledge of that, take a probe of copper or iron. If the fistula is straight, examine it with it. If the fistula is tortuous, examine it with a probe of thin lead, for lead is soft in its body.
It will pass easily upon entering and will bend towards the tortuosity. If the fistula has many openings and you cannot discover them with the probe, inject one of its openings; then the moisture which you inject will pass to the other openings and will flow out.
Then thoroughly investigate in any way you can to find out if there is a bone or nerve, or if the bottom of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a single fistula with many openings. Ascertain all this to the extent of your ability by questioning the patient and by his experience of pain when you touch the place.
And similar indications and causes of the swelling. When you have ascertained all this accurately, then proceed to treatment with confidence.  That is, you should look to see if…
the fistula is apparent and near, or in a safe place far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places I mentioned to you, then incise the fistula as I previously described and remove what is in it of the clot, the putrefied flesh, and the excess flesh.
And whatever grows in its opening of flesh or wart, and so on, and treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep-seated and straight, you should incise it deeply as much as you can, then cleanse it of all its putrefied flesh.
Then use a pledget soaked in strong medicines and insert it to the bottom of the fistula which you can reach with an instrument. Do this repeatedly until the strong medicine eats away all that remains of corruption in the bottom of the fistula.
Then dress it with ointments that produce healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal by this, cauterize it as previously described. If the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is confirmed, then investigate and incise it as I have told you, unless something prevents you from doing so.
a sinew, nerve, or main organ, as we said. If the bone is exposed and there is some corruption and blackness in it, debride it until its corruption is gone, then treat it with what will heal it until it is cured. If it does not heal and pus continues as before,
know that you have not completely removed all the corruption.  Expose everything again and thoroughly debride and cleanse it to the best of your ability, then dress it. If it heals, well and good; otherwise, know that the corruption is in a deep recess. Expose everything again.
and thoroughly debride and cleanse it to the best of your ability. If the corrupted bone is small and you can remove it, then extract it with fine forceps suitable for this.
If there are many bones, thoroughly extract them all and do not leave any behind to the best of your ability. If something from the ligaments obstructs you, and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and flesh, if present, and free the bones.
If you cannot remove the bones at once, apply something to the wound that will cause it to rot, and leave it for several days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones rot.  Keep the wound from closing the incision you made during your work.
Rather, if you fear that, place on it cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. For when it has caused those ligaments to rot and the bones to become brittle, it will be easy to extract and remove them.
If it is a single large bone, such as a bone of the leg or thigh, and similar, and only its surface is corrupted, then debride it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption disappears, then dress the wound. If a large part of it is corrupted and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it must be sawn.
And cut it all away to where the corruption ends. Then treat it until it heals. And I will tell you about a case of gangrene that occurred in a man's leg, to serve as an example and aid in your treatment. This man was young.
About thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to a cause within the body that spread to the leg, causing great swelling; there was no external cause. Then time passed, along with the mistakes of the physicians, until the swelling opened.
And much material flowed from it, and he was treated poorly, until the leg became gangrenous and many openings appeared in it, all discharging pus and bodily fluids. A number of physicians treated him for about two years, but none of them were skillful in the craft of surgery.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg and the material flowing from those openings in great quantity, and the man's body had become thin and his color yellow.  Then I inserted a probe into one of those openings; the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
And I found that some led to others from all sides of the leg. So I began by cutting open one of those openings until I uncovered some of the bone. I found it corrupted, eaten away, blackened, putrid, and perforated, so that the perforation reached the marrow.  Then I spread open what was revealed to me.
And I removed the corrupted bone. I thought that there was no corruption in the bone other than what I had cut and spread open, and that I had excised it. Then I began to dress the wound with healing medicines for a longer time, but it did not heal. Then I returned and uncovered the bone again, beyond the first uncovering.
And I found the corruption connected to the bone.  So I spread open what appeared to me also of that corruption. Then I attempted to dress it, but it did not heal nor unite. Then I uncovered it again, and I continued to cut away the bone piece by piece and attempt to heal it, but it would not heal, until I had cut away about a span of bone.
And I removed it with its marrow. Then I dressed it with medicines, and it healed quickly and completely. This repetition in the operation and its incision was necessary because of the weakness of the patient and his inability to endure, and my fear for his death, because he suffered at all times from excessive vomiting and a serious faint.  Then he recovered completely.
And in the place of the bone, firm flesh grew, and his condition in his body improved, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs, and in walking he suffered no harm whatsoever. If a protruding bone in any part of the body is broken…
Then it should be spread open in this manner: you take a ligature and tie it around the end of the protruding bone, and you instruct someone to pull it upwards, and make another ligature of thicker wool than the first ligature.
Then tie it to the flesh under the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards, and you expose the flesh from the area you want to spread open, lest the saw injure the flesh, and place a piece of wood or a board firmly under the bone from below.
Because if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupt bone.  The sawing should be slightly above the area of corruption, lest there be corruption in the cavity of the bone which does not appear on its surface to the senses, thus forcing you to saw it again.
If the bone is corrupt and not protruding, but its parts are connected to each other, and the corruption is in its middle or in some part of it, then expose the flesh from all its sides completely, then place the wood underneath, then saw it from the first side where the corruption is.
When you have finished sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little distance from the corruption, as we have said. If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupt joint itself and saw the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy other than excision. If the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand or foot, the matter of its treatment is very difficult, but you should peel away the corruption however it appears to you, and excise it and clean it in any way you can.
And by whatever method it is straightened for you, provided that a vein or nerve does not obstruct you. And know that the instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, their arrangement, their thickness and thinness, their size and smallness, their hardness and porosity. Therefore, you should prepare for each type of work an instrument similar to that work.
Know that the works themselves may indicate to you the type of instrument you need, if you have long experience and knowledge of the arts of this profession, for it is from the mastery of the craft and witnessing many types of diseases. He may devise for himself instruments similar to those for each disease, and I have depicted for you at the end of this chapter several instruments.
Making them examples to be imitated and a measure by which you may measure others, God willing. Image of a saw:

In the amputation of limbs and the sawing of bones.
Limbs may become putrefied, either from an external cause or from an internal cause. If you treat this corruption with medicinal treatment and the treatment is not effective, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing hindering it,
then it is necessary to amputate that member to where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved thereby from death or from a great calamity which is greater than the loss of the member.  A sign of this occurring in someone is that the member turns black, until you would think that fire had burned it.
Or it may fester after turning black, until that festering spreads to what is next to that member and attacks the whole body; then hasten to cut it off.  Likewise, if the cause of the corruption is the sting of some venomous creature, such as a sea scorpion, or a snake, or a tarantula, and the like.
If the corruption or sting is in the tip of a finger, amputate the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.  Likewise, if it has taken hold in the hand, amputate it from the base of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it takes hold in the forearm bones.
And likewise, if it takes hold in the arm, amputate the arm at the elbow in the joint itself.  If the corruption progresses and you see it taking hold toward the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient; use other treatments to the best of your ability.
Do the same with the leg: if the corruption takes hold in a toe, amputate the toe at one of the joints; if it takes hold in the metatarsus, amputate the whole foot; if it ascends to the knee, amputate the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no recourse but to abandon it and leave the patient to death. The method of amputating or dissecting a member is to tie a ligature below the place you wish to cut off, and tie another ligature above the place.
One assistant pulls the lower ligature downwards, and another assistant pulls the upper ligature upwards; you yourself dissect the flesh between the ligatures with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then cut or dissect. You should place linen cloths on all sides.
Lest the saw touch the healthy tissue, causing the patient additional pain and hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, staunch the place quickly or apply some styptic powder, then return to your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the injured member with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I will tell you about an example of a man who experienced this very condition in his leg; a blackness appeared in his leg, accompanied by burning like fire.
This corruption first appeared in his toe, until it consumed the whole leg.  The man, seeing the corruption spreading through his limb and the intense pain and burning, of his own accord amputated it at the joint and recovered.
After a long time, the same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand. He came to me, and I tried to stop the corruption with the medications I applied to his hand, after cleansing his body. But the corruption did not stop and continued to spread into the next finger.
Until the corruption consumed the hand, and he asked me to amputate it. I refused, hoping to stop the corruption, and also fearing death for him if I amputated his hand, for the man was weak.  When he despaired of me, he returned to his town.
Then word reached me that he had amputated his entire hand and recovered. I have recounted this story to help with similar diseases and to serve as a guide to be followed and acted upon.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
On the treatment of fistulas and how to inject them with medication.
If a swelling occurs in one of the fleshy organs, and the duration of the swelling is prolonged until it gathers pus, then bursts or is lanced, and all the pus within it comes out, leaving the place empty like a vessel.
And the skin over it is like a thin rag, not excessively decayed so as to affect bone, nerve or ligament.  Therefore it deserves to be called a fistula, and not a sinus, unless its duration is prolonged until the decay affects any of these organs.
Then it is called a sinus or fistula, and its treatment is to cut away all that skin as it extends, especially if it has become thin and like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place because of its decay.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and the decay has not reached that point, and there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with injection. This is to look at the fistula; if it is large and the pus that flows from it is foul-smelling, then inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris, equal parts, gathered in a vessel and cooked on the fire until the medicine thickens and reaches the consistency of honey.  Then take what you need, thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the fistula, then bind its opening and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then remove it by squeezing. Do this for several days until the fistula is cleansed and the foul smell is gone.  You may inject it with ash water if this medicine is not available to you. This is to take the ash of grapevine wood or oak wood and pour water over it.
Then filter it and inject it until you are certain that the fistula has been washed. If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, inject it with water and honey in which some powdered verdigris has been mixed.
Or inject it with honey and wine mixed together, for honey cleanses and washes, and wine closes the fistula, especially if the wine has a binding and drying quality.  When you have done this several times and are certain that the fistula’s decay is gone, then inject it with something that will cause flesh to grow there.
Such as taking some palm ointment and dissolving it in rose oil and astringent wine, or injecting it with some other medicines and ointments whose properties we have described in the chapter on ointments. If the opening of the fistula is narrow and does not allow the injection tube to pass,
widen it slightly with an iron instrument or place in it a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment or theriac ointment until it widens.  Similarly, if the opening is too wide, bring its edges together with sutures, leaving only enough space for the injection tube to enter.
Similarly, if the opening from which the pus flows is high up, make an incision in the lowest part so that the pus may flow downwards, for if pus collects in the depths of the fistula, it prevents the growth of flesh there.
If you cannot incise the fistula downwards as desired, then position the member so that the pus flows easily, as you see fit, so that nothing of the pus remains retained within.
As for the cohesive medicines which are applied externally to the fistula, and the method of their application: take some of the cohesive ointments similar to what you desire, and spread it on a linen cloth, the cloth being large enough to cover the whole fistula. Then, with scissors, cut a hole opposite the mouth of the fistula, slightly larger than the mouth of the fistula. Then spread some soft ointment on another cloth, to the size of the hole, and place it there, spaced away from the mouth of the fistula so that the pus may easily escape.  Do not remove the larger cloth until later.
several days; but that on the mouth of the fistula, you remove at all times, so that what has collected there of pus may come out, and so you may know what flows from it of pus, whether it is much or little, healthy or unhealthy.
Along with this also, examine the fistula itself: does its owner feel pain in it, or not, and is there swelling in it, or not? If your treatment continues in this way, and you see that the material which comes out is slight at the mouth of the fistula...
know that the fistula has adhered or is near to adhering. Then, resolve it on the morrow or on the third day. And when you have opened the wound, replace the cloths with others and renew the ointment. If, after a long time, thin pus comes out from the fistula, do not despair of its healing.
Its healing is near, for some people are slow in the growth of flesh in their wounds, and others are the opposite. If, after many days, unhealthy pus comes out from the fistula, know that the fistula has not healed. If the healing of the fistula is slow…
and its matter is prolonged, increase the drying medicines, and let them be medicines which are moist in their consistency and dry in their strength, like palm ointment if an excess of litharge has been added to it. And among the most effective things to treat it with is that palm ointment be taken…
and it is dissolved with rose oil and sprinkled with old wine, moderate in consistency, then you knead it with it and use it.  He may do something similar if you do not have palm ointment: honey, if you cook it until it thickens and use it, or take myrrh, aloes, and mastic, crush them all together, and sprinkle them on the honey while it is on the fire. Then you apply it on a cloth and bind it on the fistula, or it is applied with the honey which you have cooked until it thickens, and you sprinkle the medicines on it and place the cloth on it and bind it.
And long rhubarb, the root of the asphodel, the powder of  cistus, and centaury may be used in such a case, singly or mixed together; crush and sift them and sprinkle them on the honey that was described, and use it. If the matter of the fistula is prolonged and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth.
And if it has affected the bones or other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it like a fistula, as previously described.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
On the treatment of the felon, the diseased nail, the excision of the excess of a finger, and the separation of adherent fingers.
A felon is an excessive amount of flesh which grows under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and it may grow in the other fingers. If its matter is prolonged and its treatment neglected, it swells into a hot tumor.
Or it becomes putrid and foul until it eats the root of the nail, and perhaps it destroys it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul smell, and the tip of the finger becomes broad and its color livid.  If you treat it with what we mentioned in the classification and your treatment is not effective,
it is necessary to cut away with an instrument all the excess which grows from the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards, for cauterization is very beneficial in this.  And as for if the bone is sound and the nail also sound,
and the corner containing the nail has constricted the flesh inward and is causing it to ulcerate and injure it, it is necessary to place a thin pledget under the corner of the nail which is ulcerating the flesh and raise it upwards and cut that flesh gently.
And you should apply to what remains of the flesh of the cauterizing escharotics until it is all gone, then treat it with ointments until it heals. And as for if the corruption has affected the bone, it is necessary to cut that bone and remove it, for it will not heal at all as long as there is a corrupted bone in it.
If you see the erosion and corruption spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of the phalanges as previously mentioned, then treat it until it heals. If the nail receives a blow or bruise and severe pain occurs in it, it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Then incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, an oblique incision from above to below, and be careful not to reach with the incision to the flesh beneath the nail, for by that you will cause the patient severe pain and it will be a cause for the growth of excess flesh in the place, then treat the area with that which soothes pain.
As for the supernumerary finger which is produced in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, and it may have bones in some of it, and it may have a nail, and the growth of some of them is at the root of the joint of some of the fingers.
Or its growth may be in some of the phalanges of the finger. Those which grow in some of the phalanges of the finger do not move, and those which grow at the joint of the finger may move.  As for that which is only fleshy, its cutting is easy, and that is to cut it at its origin with a wide scalpel.
As for that whose growth is at the root of the joint, its treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting it. As for that which grows in the finger at one of the phalanges, it is necessary to first cut its flesh in a circular cut to the bone, then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the adhesion which occurs to the fingers, some to others, this often occurs, and it is from that with which a person is born, and it is at the healing of a wound, or a burn of fire, and the like. Then it is necessary to incise that adhesion.
Until the fingers return to their natural form, then place between them a pledget or a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil, lest it adhere quickly, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until the place heals as it should.
Similarly, if adhesion occurs to some of the fingers with the palm, incise that adhesion according to what is suitable and improves the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On the excision of polyps.
Polyps are twisted, thick veins filled with dark, stagnant blood, which occur in most parts of the body, most frequently in the legs, especially in the legs of those who carry burdens and those who work. First, it is necessary to rub the body with black hellebore several times with a strong rubbing.
Then, bleed the patient in the basilica vein. As for its treatment with the iron, it is of two kinds: one is to incise and remove the black blood, and the other is to extract the vein and remove it entirely. As for its incision, it is in this manner:  first bathe the leg well with warm water.
until the thick, turbid blood is dissolved. Then, tie the patient's leg from above his thigh to below his knee with a bandage, then incise the vein in one place, or in two places, or in three, with a wide incision.
Then, draw out the black blood with your hand from below the leg upwards, and from above downwards, until you remove the amount of blood that you see as sufficient or what the patient's strength can bear. Then bandage it and instruct him to avoid foods that generate black bile, and repeat the purging and bleeding.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient. As for its extraction, it is done in this manner: shave the patient's leg if it has much hair, then take him to the bathhouse and bathe his leg with hot water until it becomes red and sweats, or he performs strenuous exercise.
If a bathhouse is not available, until the limb is warmed, then incise the skin opposite the vein lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or at its bottom near the heel. Then open the skin with hooks and dissect the vein from every side until it is perceptible to the touch.
And when it appears, you will see it as dark red.  When it is freed from the skin, you will also see it as if it were a tendon. Then insert a probe under it, and when it is raised and emerges from the skin, suspend it with a smooth, blunt hook.  Then make another incision near that incision, about three fingers wide.
Then dissect the skin from over the vein until it appears, then raise it with the probe as you did before and suspend it with another hook as you did initially. Then make another incision, or many incisions if necessary.
Then extract it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull and extract it until it emerges from the second incision. Then pull it to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it from the third incision, above all the incisions, until when it is all extracted, cut it.
If it does not yield to pulling and extraction, then insert a needle with strong doubled thread, tie it, and pull it. Insert the probe underneath and twist it with your hand to every side until it emerges.  Take care that it does not break, for if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to extract it.
And harm will befall the patient from it.  When you have extracted it all, place wool soaked in a potion and rose oil or olive oil on the wounds and treat it until it heals. If the varix is constricted, with convolutions and torsion in various directions,
and is not straight as we said, then it is necessary to make an incision on it at each convolution and place of torsion, then suspend it with hooks until you extract it completely.  Take care when incising it that you do not cut or injure the vein, for it will make its extraction difficult for you; therefore, exert yourself carefully.
Image of the incision made in the varix:
Image of the blind hook:
It should not be hooked like other hooks, nor should it have a sharp point lest it injure the vein. It should be thick, smoothly curved, for if it is thin it will cut the vein with its thinness; rather, it should have a greater thickness, as we said.
Chapter ninety-one.
On the removal of a varicose vein.
This vein develops in the legs in hot countries like the Hijaz and the lands of the Arabs, and in hot, barren countries with little fertility.  It may also develop in other parts of the body besides the legs, and its development is due to an infection that occurs under the skin.
Just as living creatures and worms occur inside the body, and gourd and worms develop between the skin and flesh, the sign of the beginning of this vein is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the place becomes swollen, and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that swelling.
It is as if it were the root of a plant or animal; when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one to two dirhams, tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
Whenever something emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut some of it and wrap the remainder; do not cut it from its root before it all comes out, for if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing swelling, infection in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be treated carefully and pulled out little by little until it is all out and nothing remains of it in the body.  From this vein, in some people, there may emerge something that is five or ten cubits in length.
It has been reported to me that it came out of a man to the length of twenty cubits. If it breaks off while you are treating it, insert a probe into its hole and press it firmly against the body until all its matter is emptied. Then treat the place with medicines for several days.
Then treat it as you would treat a tumor. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or in the leg itself, and it may have many openings from each of which a branch emerges. Treat it as we have mentioned in the classification and as previously described.
Chapter ninety-two.
Concerning the incision for the worm that develops under the armpit and is called the cow's disease.
This disease is called in some of our countries the cow's disease because it frequently affects cows. It is a single small worm that develops between the skin and the flesh and moves throughout the body, ascending and descending.
Its movement from one member to another is perceptible to the touch until it pierces the skin at some point and emerges.  It is formed from the corruption of some humors, as is the case with worms, snakes, and the gourd-like growth in the abdomen.
Its harm is expected to be that if it moves in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it may open it and emerge, destroying the eye. This happens frequently. If you wish to treat it and remove it, this should be done when it moves and becomes perceptible to the touch.
It is necessary to firmly tie above and below it with a strong ligature, then incise over it and remove it. If it has sunk into the flesh and you cannot find it, cauterize the area with fire until you burn it. The greatest harm it is expected to cause is to the eye, as we have said.
If you see it has reached the head near the eye, tie firmly below it on the forehead, then incise over it and remove it. The patient should be treated by purifying his body with purgative medicines for bad, corrupt humors, and should avoid foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
Concerning the incision for the disease known as the gnawing ulcer.
This disease, which in our country is called *nafir*, is a pain that appears in some members and then moves from one member to another. I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a sick woman in some of the deserts. She uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in a vein of the forearm.  After a while I saw that swelling move with the ulna, like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as possible, like mercury.
When it moved from one place to another, the pain disappeared from that place and settled in the shoulder. Then I waited an hour, and it ran throughout the body until it was in the other arm.  Then she told me that it went around her whole body, as I witnessed.
So I marveled at the speed of its movement from one member to another.  I had never before seen this disease with my own eyes in this way, except that I had seen a number of people whose pain moved from one member to another, but I had not seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.
And I judged that this was only because the woman was from the desert people, dry of body and with visible veins. Therefore, that moving wind appeared to the senses, and it should not appear in this way in people of comfort and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it and its sufferer feels pain, and if it appears to you visibly as we have mentioned, then bind above and below it with a bandage and incise it until that congested wind emerges and cauterize the place.
If you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by cleansing the body and with things that expel and disperse winds, such as the seeds of rue and the seeds of *skibinǧ* and similar medicines.
Chapter ninety-four.
On extracting arrows.
Arrows may differ according to their types and according to the places in the body where they are located. As for their differences according to their types, there are large ones and small ones, hollow glass ones and solid glass ones, and some have three points and some have four points.
Some have barbs and some have splinters. As for those according to the organs in which they are located, they are of two kinds: either the organs are hollow principal organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. If an arrow has entered one of these organs and you see the signs of death which I will describe to you later, then you should avoid extracting that arrow from it, for in most cases death will overtake its owner. And if these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not disappeared into the depth of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  And of the signs of the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane covering the brain, then there will result from that a severe headache, drowsiness and dizziness.
And if these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not disappeared into the depth of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  And of the signs of the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane covering the brain, then there will result from that a severe headache, drowsiness and dizziness. And redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, vomiting, and perhaps blood will come from the nostrils or ears, and perhaps speech will cease and the voice will be lost, and a white moisture resembling gruel will come from the place of the wound, and watery fluid from it will flow.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and from extracting the arrow if it has not been extracted. As for the signs of the arrow if it strikes the heart and is near the left breast, and one feels it as if it has been driven into something solid and not into something empty,
and perhaps the arrow will have a movement resembling the beat of the pulse, and black blood will flow from the wound, and this will be followed by coldness of the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting; then know that death is inevitably approaching. And a sign of the arrow if it wounds the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound.
And the vessels near the neck swell, and the color of the patient changes, and he breathes heavily and seeks to inhale cold air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm which is in the chest, then it will be near the smaller ribs, and the breathing will be great with severe pain.
And he will sigh and all the members of the shoulders will move. And if the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain will follow, and blood resembling the liver in its redness will come from the wound. And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps something undigested from the food will come from the wound.
And its condition is apparent. And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and is embedded in it, and something of the feces, or fat, or intestine which has been perforated comes from the wound, then there is no hope of treatment or of extracting the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine comes out,
and something protrudes from it to the outside and the pain intensifies for the patient, then know that he is doomed. As for the other members, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, vertebrae of the back, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar members, they are more often saved.
When the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned. And I tell you of some of what I have witnessed concerning these arrows so that you may thereby be guided in your treatment. And that is that an arrow once struck a man in the corner of his eye at the root of the nose.
Then I extracted it for him from the other side, under the lobe of the ear, and he recovered, and no harm befell his eye. And I extracted another arrow for a Jew which had struck him in the lobe of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had hidden itself, and I grasped only its small tip which is attached to the wood.
And it was a large arrow from the composite bows, square-headed, smooth, without barbs.  The Jew recovered and no ill event occurred in his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic.
And it was one with barbs; so I made an incision for him between the jugular veins, and it had sunk into his throat, so I gently manipulated it until I extracted it. The Christian was saved and recovered.  And I extracted another arrow for a man which had struck him in the abdomen, and we judged that he would die from it.
But when thirty days or so had passed, and nothing in his condition had changed, I made an incision over the arrow, and I manipulated it and extracted it, and he recovered, and no ill event befell him. And I saw a man whom an arrow had struck in his back, and the wound had closed over it.
Then after seven years the arrow emerged at the root of her thigh. And I saw a woman who had been struck in her abdomen by an arrow, and the wound had closed, and the arrow remained. Nothing in her condition changed, nor did she find any harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man whom an arrow had struck in the face, and the wound had closed, and he felt little pain from it. And there are many like this. And I extracted an arrow for a man, one of the Sultan's guards, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, leaning slightly to the right.
And the entire arrow was hidden. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck. I found the arrow wound very narrow, so I explored it with a thin probe, but I did not feel it. And he felt a stinging pain under his ear, on the right side.
I hoped that this stinging pain was from the tip of the arrow, so I applied a dressing with drawing and ripening power, hoping that the area would swell and the arrow's location would be revealed so that I could incise it. But nothing happened in the area to indicate that the arrow had reached that point.
So I continued the dressing for many days, but nothing happened.  Then, during that time, the wound healed, and the patient despaired of its removal for a time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and told me. I then applied a strong caustic medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it, and I felt the thin tip of the arrow which adheres to the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that strong medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared to us visibly.  And it had been with him for about four months.
Then, when the wound widened and I was able to insert forceps into it, I pulled and moved it, but it did not respond to removal.  I continued to gently manipulate it and devise methods with various instruments until one day I grasped it firmly with forceps, as its image is shown at the end of the chapter.
And the physicians judged that the cartilage of his nose would not heal, but I healed it, and the wound closed, and the patient recovered completely without any further harm. And I tell you the method of removing some arrows so that you may make that a measure and example for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description nor encompassed by a book.  Rather, the skillful craftsman judges by the little from the much, and by what is present from what is absent, and deduces a new operation and a new instrument in strange emergencies.
If we descend to this craft, then I say that arrows are removed from the members in which they are fixed in two ways: either by pulling from the place where they entered, or from the opposite direction, and those that are removed from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy place, so it is pulled and removed.  If it does not yield to removal from the place where it entered, then it is necessary for you to leave it for several days until the flesh around it putrefies, so that its extraction becomes easier; and so it is if it is embedded in bone.
And if it does not yield to removal, then leave it also for several days and return to pulling and moving it each day, for it will come out. If it does not yield to removal after several days, then you should pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill until you widen the space for the arrow, then pull it out and remove it.
If the arrow embedded in the bone of the head has penetrated deeply into one of the ventricles of the brain and some of those symptoms which I have mentioned to you appear in the patient, then desist from pulling the arrow and leave it until its condition improves after several days.
then persevere in pulling out the arrow; and if it is very firmly embedded and does not yield to pulling, then use the drills around the arrow as I have described to you, then treat the wound until it heals.  And as for if the arrow has disappeared into a place in the body, and is hidden from sensation, then probe for it with a probe; and if you feel it, then pull it out with some of the instruments suitable for pulling it out; and if you cannot reach it because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is neither bone nor nerve nor vein there,
then incise it until the wound is widened and you can reach the arrow until you extract it.  If it has barbs, grasp them and free the flesh entangled in them from every side by every method you can; and persevere, if you are unable to free the flesh, in breaking the barbs and twisting them until you are freed.
And when you attempt to extract the arrow in whatever place it may be, use the twisting of your hand with forceps in all directions until you free it, and use the utmost gentleness lest the arrow break and it becomes difficult for you to pull it out and extract it; and if you cannot manage it at your first attempt,
leave it for some days until the flesh around it putrefies, then try again; for it will then be easier. And if bleeding interferes with you, use what we have mentioned of treatment in its chapter; and guard carefully against cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon, and use ingenuity.
In every way you can free the arrow, and let it be gently and slowly and steadily as I have described to you; and it is necessary for you, when pulling out the arrow, to place the patient in the same position he was in when the arrow entered, for this is more suitable.
If you cannot do this, use whatever position you can; but as for the arrow which emerges from the opposite side, either something of it will have emerged outwards, or you will find the tip of the arrow by touch just under the skin, and see it protruding.
Then make an incision upon it, and let the incision be large enough to admit the forceps, then pull it out, for it will easily come out.  If it sticks in a bone, twist your hand round and round until the arrow affects the bone and makes room for itself, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for some days, then try again until it comes out. If the arrowhead is in it, push it with it. If the arrowhead has fallen off and you wish to use pushing, then insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the tail of the arrow, then push it with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that enters that hollow, for the arrow will easily come out in this way.  If the arrow is poisoned, it is necessary to cut away all the flesh in which the poison has spread, if you are able to do so, then treat it with what is suitable for that.
If the arrow which has fallen into the chest, or into the belly, or into the bladder, or into the flank is near what can be felt with a probe, and you are able to make an incision upon it, then make an incision and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve, and take it out.
Then stitch the wound if it needs stitching, then treat it until it heals.  A picture of the forceps with which arrows are pulled out:
Their ends are like the beak of a bird; they are made like a file, so that when they grasp an arrow or anything, they do not let go.  And various kinds are made, large, small, and medium-sized, all according to the size of the arrow and the width or narrowness of the wound.
A picture of the hollowed-out pusher:
A picture of the solid pusher:
This has a solid end like an awl, to make it easier to enter the hollowed-out arrow and push it.
Chapter ninety-five.
On the incision of veins.
The veins which it is customary to bleed in the body are thirty in number; of these, sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the ‘whispering’ veins, and the two arteries in the temples which are visible, and the two veins at the inner canthus of the eyes known as the ‘seeing’ veins.
And the vein erect in the middle of the forehead, and the vein which is at the tip of the nose, and the two jugular veins in the neck, and the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins in the lower lip—these veins are known as the ‘veins of the jaw’—and the two veins under the tongue.
As for the veins which are bled in the arm and hand, they are five veins: one is the cephalic, which is on the outer side, and the common people call it the vein of the head; and the median cubital, which is the middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the basilic, which is situated on the inner side, and it is also called the axillary, and the common people call it the vein of the belly; and the vein of the forearm, which is situated on the ulna, and to which it adheres, and which appears very clearly above the thumb; and the azygos.
And this is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger; it has two branches. And in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is that which is under the popliteal space on the outer side; and the second is the saphenous, and its place is at the heel on the inner side; and the vein of the sciatic nerve, and its place is at the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to them. As for the two veins which are behind the ears, the benefit of bleeding them is for chronic colds, migraine, ringworm, and chronic bad sores of the head, and the manner of bleeding them is as I describe.
And that is to shave the head of the patient and rub his scalp in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, rubbing well; then the patient’s neck is constricted with a turban until the two veins and their position appear behind the ears in the two low places of the head; then you search for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulsation under your finger, there you mark with ink.
Then you take a lancet, which is what is known as the *nashshal*, then you insert it under the vein in the skin until the lancet reaches the bone; then you raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein with the skin, a severed cut, and the length of the cut is the amount of two closed fingers.
Or thereabouts, and you let out the amount of blood you want, then you bind them with bandages and leave them until they heal.  And it was mentioned earlier in the book, their cutting and cauterization. As for the two arteries which are in the temples, the benefit of bleeding them is for chronic migraine, severe headache, persistent ophthalmia, and sharp, profuse discharges into the eyes.
And the manner of bleeding them is as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the veins appear clearly to the touch, and their pulsation is apparent under your finger; then you mark with ink. Then you raise the skin from above the vein upwards with your index finger.
And you insert the lancet, the *nashshal*, from below and raise the vein upwards and sever it as you did with the other two veins, and you let out blood according to your need; then you loosen the constriction of the patient’s neck and place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then you place cotton and a bandage on it and bind it tightly from above and leave it until it heals. And their mention, cutting, and cauterization were mentioned earlier in the book.  As for bleeding the vein of the forehead, its benefit, after bleeding the cephalic vein, is for chronic facial ailments such as ringworm, ulcers, and erysipelas.
And the manner of bleeding it, as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the vein appears; then you take the instrument called the axe, and this is its image:
You place the projecting spike which is in the head of the axe on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or something similar, and you let the blood flow to the extent you desire; then you loosen the constriction of the patient’s neck and bind it until it heals.
And it may be opened with a wide lancet, but it should not be sharp-pointed like other lancets, but rather slightly wide-ended, and you bleed it obliquely, because the bone is near, and the lancet may break in it if it is thin.
As for the two veins which are at the temples, their benefit is for eye ailments such as ringworm, redness, and blepharitis, and facial diseases. As for the manner of bleeding them, it is that the patient constricts his neck with a turban, then you bleed them while you are standing over his head, and let the bleeding be slightly obliquely lengthwise with a small, slightly wide lancet.
For the place has no flesh in it; if the lancet is thin-pointed, it may break. Then you let out the amount of blood you need and place cotton on them and bind them for one night, then unbind them. As for bleeding the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
And severe headache and facial diseases like erysipelas which appears in the nose, especially if it is chronic.  As for the manner of bleeding it, the patient constricts his neck, then you grasp his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long lancet.
And you insert it into the middle of the nasal bone itself between the nasal septum in a straight line, for the vein does not appear to the touch there; then the blood will emerge immediately. It is necessary to move your hand with the lancet a little and let out the amount of blood you need, then bind it for a night, for it clots quickly.
As for the jugular veins, the benefit of bleeding them is for shortness of breath, the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic diseases which appear on the surface of the skin, such as black vitiligo, impetigo, bad ulcers, and sores. As for the manner of bleeding them, the patient constricts under them in his neck with a bandage, and the surgeon stands at the head of the patient.
And the patient sits on a chair, then you bleed the vein lengthwise with a somewhat wide incision, then you let out a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see is needed. Then you do likewise with the other vein, then you untie the bandage.
And you constrict the two veins moderately, lest the patient suffocate, and you leave him until the next day, for the wound will heal. As for the veins of the temples, the benefit of bleeding them after bleeding the cephalic vein is that it benefits from thrush in the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, cracking of the lips, and bad ulcers.
which are in and around the nose.  The manner of bleeding them is that you seat the patient before you and constrict his neck with a turban, then you part his lips and look at the two veins, one of which you see to the right of the lip and the other to the left, and you recognize them by their blackness.
And that is also because around them are small, black veins; so cut them with a cut that severs them. If it is difficult for you and you do not know what they are, then aim to cut the largest and most apparent ones.  Likewise, do this for the two veins which are in the lower lip.
As for the two veins which are under the tongue, the benefit of bleeding them after bleeding the cephalic vein is for the inflammations which are in the throat from disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth. The manner of bleeding them is that you seat the patient between your hands, facing the sun, and you raise his tongue and look under the tongue, on one side a vein and on the other side a vein, and their color is toward blackness.
Then you bleed them, and be careful not to go too far in cutting them, for beneath them are arteries, and perhaps there may result bleeding of blood from those arteries. As for the three veins which are bled in the elbow, these are those which customarily are bled in all people, and their bleeding is done in two ways.
Either by piercing with a wide, rounded or olive-shaped lancet to the depth, or by incising with a scalpel, which is the <i>nashal</i> [and this is its image], image of the wide, rounded lancet:
It is wide as you see, so that it is suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins which contain thick, turbid blood. And this is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:
And this lancet is less wide and thinner at the tip, suitable for bleeding thin veins which contain thin, yellowish blood. And this is the image of the <i>nashal</i> lancet:
This is the <i>nashal</i> which is suitable for incision, and there are types of it, wide and narrow, according to the width and narrowness of the veins also. And by this one may infer others, and it is well-known among the craftsmen.
And as for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of bleeding it is that it draws blood from the illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from what is near the chest and abdomen.  And it is necessary for the phlebotomist, when bleeding it, to beware of it and be careful with it, for beneath it is an artery. If he makes a mistake and goes too deep with the lancet, he will cut that artery.
Then bleeding will occur, therefore it is necessary that its bleeding should not be with the lancet for puncturing, but its bleeding should be by incision with the <i>nashal</i>. If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to avoid it and turn to another, or seek one of its branches.
Or bleed in its place the vein of the arm, for it is clear, and incise it with the <i>nashal</i> lancet as we said. If you wish to bleed it itself, then before tightening the arm it is necessary to feel the place until you recognize the place of the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then you tie the arm and incise the vein with a sharp incision with the *nashal* lancet as we said, and take care that the incision is far from the place of the artery. And when you see, upon tightening the ligature, swelling in the place which you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood, upon bleeding, spurt like the urine of a boy, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery.  Then immediately place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the blood stops, and often it will stop, then tighten the arm.
And leave it, and warn the patient against neglecting it, and let him be on bed rest and not move for several days until it heals. If the blood does not stop and it overcomes you and you do not have medicine at hand, then amputate the artery if it appears to you, for its ends will contract and the blood will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell and split it and take one half and tie it tightly on the place of the vein with a ligature and bandages until the next day. If the blood stops, otherwise treat it with what was mentioned before of placing styptics, and stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the smallness of the wound and the tightness of the ligature in the arm, know this. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of bleeding it is that it draws blood from the top of the head and the lower body, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, as we said.
And it is necessary for the one who bleeds it to be careful when bleeding it, for under it is a nerve. If he increases the insertion of the lancet and injures the nerve, numbness will occur in it which is difficult to cure, and perhaps it will not heal at all. And this nerve often appears to the touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and cannot be distinguished, then you should make your incision in it lengthwise and avoid the nerve as much as you can. If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of bleeding it is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for diseases of the eyes, and it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish to bleed it, to make the incision with the olive lancet or with the broad, basil-shaped lancet, because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery or nerve under it.
However, when bleeding, you should avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and seek the soft place. It does not harm if it is not struck with the first blow to be bled again several times, except that it may swell in some people if it is not bled with the first blow.
But that swelling does not harm it at all. As for the method of bleeding, its complications, and what should be done to remedy it, the first thing is that you should know that bleeding is used either only to preserve health.
Or it is used in diseases. That which is used to preserve health and maintain it and to guard against the occurrence of diseases is that the bleeding should be in one of the three veins in the elbow, namely, the cephalic, the basilic, and the median, and that the bleeding should be at the beginning of spring if signs of plethora appear.
And the bleeding should be on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of the day have passed. As for the bleeding that is used in diseases, it does not have a limited time, but whenever necessity and need require it, day or night.
And at every hour and at every time. Children should not be bled until they are fourteen years old, nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled. If someone intends to bleed for any reason whatsoever.
He should cleanse his bowels before bleeding with a gentle enema if there is much retained stool, lest putrid impurities be drawn into the veins from the intestines during bleeding, harming the principal organs.  Nor should one bleed the consumptive, the drunkard, or the intoxicated until that has passed from them.
Bleeding should also be avoided after dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive coitus, fatigue, exercise, sleeplessness, fasting, and everything that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental. Then, look to the thinning of the humors beforehand if the blood is thick.
With food, drink, and medicine if he can do so. Then he should enter the bath unless something prevents him, or he should engage in some exercise so that the blood is thinned, and the bleeding should be done in the middle of the day as we said. He should aim to free his chest that day from all bad psychological conditions.
Such as worries, anger, and fear, and from all physical conditions such as excessive fatigue and exertion, coitus, and the like. And he should prepare for his session the things which people customarily use, such as various perfumes and scents, entertainment and the like, each person according to his ability.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion higher than the cushion on which the patient sits. Then he extends his arm and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand two or three times, then he tightens the ligature with the bandage and twists it two or three times. Let the tightening be moderate.
Because if the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightening it prevents the flow of blood, or if it is towards relaxation it also prevents the flow of blood. Then after the tightening, it is necessary for the patient to rub both his hands together.
Until the veins swell and become perceptible to the touch. Then the phlebotomist wipes the lancet with a little old oil, especially, then he places the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself below the place which he wants to bleed a little, lest the vein slip and avoid the incision. For some veins you find to be like a tendon, slipping away during phlebotomy, and some are full of wind, so when the lancet is placed on them, they sink beneath the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein, or if it opens it, it is only a narrow opening.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be careful and deliberate in all these matters. Then he lowers the lancet. If the vein opens at that time, otherwise he repeats it again a little below or above that place quickly if the place is not swollen.
If the patient swells or is frightened, leave him for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage, for it might cause a hot swelling, and do not let him enter the bath. Then he can repeat the phlebotomy if he wishes.  If the lancet is inserted and the opening is small and the flow of blood is thin,
and you fear that the desired amount of blood will not come out, then return the lancet to the same hole gently and straight, and increase the opening slightly, and do this quickly before the place swells, for in many people the place may swell with a small opening.
If you see that it has swollen, do not repeat it at all, for it will not help you. Put something of the dregs of oil on it, for it facilitates the flow of blood, and it is better in this place than the oil itself and other ointments as well.
Therefore use the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies when the flow of blood is difficult.  The theriac Pharomach and the shakhzanaja may also do this, if one of them is placed on the place, for the blood will thin and dissolve if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of the phlebotomy—and this often happens, especially to someone who has been bled only once or whose vein opening was small—act quickly and place a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water on the swelling and bind it for an hour, for it will resolve.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has completely left the vein itself or another vein. If something black or green remains in the place after days, it does no harm. If you wish, apply something of aloe and bitter substances dissolved.
Or something of the juice of the  foudanj and the like.  Often a swelling and a node occur when bleeding the basil vein; place your hand upon it. If you find it yielding when you prod it, then that is a bad node, and beware of putting on it anything of what we have mentioned.
For perhaps arterial blood will flow from it; but bind it with something astringent to solidify the place, then treat it with the other treatments until it heals. And it is necessary that you let out for each person blood according to his strength and what appears of the color predominant in the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it reddens; and likewise, if you see it thick, let it flow until it thins; and likewise if it is acrid, until its acridity departs.  It is necessary for someone who is full-bodied and strong and needs to have blood removed all at once…
…to widen the vein opening and the lancet to be wide. And for someone who is weak, the opposite of that. And it is necessary that you let it out in stages, and that the opening be narrow. And the best thing to use in opening a vein is something sharp, well-honed, incised, not punctured.
And this type of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and from cutting a nerve; and it is better and safer than bloodletting across or lengthwise. And whoever is accustomed to fainting during bloodletting, it is necessary that you give him before the bloodletting something of bread soaked in pomegranate juice or oxymel.
If he is feverish and you let blood out for him in three or four times, then if he is cold in temperament, let him take before the bloodletting bread soaked in hydromel or in spiced honey-wine or in pleasantly-scented wine.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting and its cause is the exit of much blood, then it is necessary that he be given meat broth and thin, pleasantly-scented wine, and he should use fragrant substances with aloeswood, and rub his chest with it, and use all that we mentioned in the section on fainting.
which comes from vomiting. And as for whoever wants to relieve his arm and let his blood out again, it is necessary for whoever had his bloodletting for much vomiting and whose strength is weak that you let the blood out little by little according to his strength in successive days.
And as for whoever wants to relieve his arm and let his blood out again and his body is strong, let him do that after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting. And as for whoever wants to draw the blood from his body to the opposite side to which it inclined, it is necessary that you relieve him on the second or third day.
And as for whoever has much blood in his body which has become hot and sharp and caused a fever, it is necessary that you let blood out from him in one go, and let out from him a large quantity, and widen the opening until fainting appears, after you have checked all the conditions of bloodletting. And that you put your hand on his pulse when the blood flows, lest death occur instead of fainting, for that often happens if the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs. And it is not necessary, if you want to open the arm and let the blood out again.
And if the mouth of the vein has closed and the exit of blood is difficult, do not prick it forcefully or twist it strongly, for that is very bad. Rather, either leave it until you bleed it again, or remove with the blade of the lancet what has solidified of the blood in the mouth of the vein.
Or apply to it something of salt dissolved in water, or apply to it something of theriac faruq or shkhznaya, and prick it delicately until the blood comes out.  If the vein has swollen, then leave it.
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If the need requires letting blood again and it is necessary, then either bleed him above that place, or bleed him in the other arm or in another vein.
As for bleeding the arm vein, it is bled instead of the akhl and basillic veins if they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of them.  Its method of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly, then it is tied above it with a ligature slightly, a moderate tightening.
Then bleed the vein at a slight angle, neither across nor lengthwise, and let the opening be wide, and let your bleeding be a little above the joint of the hand. If the exit of the blood is difficult, return the hand to the vessel with hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until it reaches your need. If you are in the summer days, then you may dispense with returning the hand to the hot water.  The use of hot water to make the blood flow is most often in the winter time, and bleeding this vein is safer than all veins. Because there is no underlying striking vein or nerve. As for bleeding the cephalic vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments.  Its method of bleeding is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no underlying striking vein or nerve. As for bleeding the cephalic vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments.  Its method of bleeding is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells. And it becomes very apparent to the touch, then bleed it at a slight angle. And even if you completely cut it, that will not harm him at all. Be careful not to push your hand deeply with the lancet, for beneath it is the nerve of the fingers and the place is bare of flesh. Then return the hand to the hot water.
And leave it to flow. For if you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will congeal in the mouth of the vein and be prevented from flowing. When you have removed the amount of blood needed, place fat and salt on the vein lest it close quickly.
And similarly you should do with every narrow branch. As for the benefit of bleeding it from the left hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen.  And you do the same in bleeding it as you did in the second, exactly. As for bleeding the saphenous vein, its benefit is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as uterine ailments.
And retention of menstruation, and kidney diseases, and chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.  Its method of bleeding is that he puts his leg in hot water and has it rubbed until the veins swell, then you tie above the joint of the leg with a bandage, and the vein is located at the heel, on the surface, towards the great toe.
And many branches extend from it on the surface of the foot. So bleed it in the widest branch of it, or at the heel where it converges; this is better and safer.  If you bleed it on the surface of the foot, then be careful of the nerves which are underneath on the surface of the foot.
And make your incision in a twisting manner, as if you intend to amputate it, and let the lancet be sharp. If the blood does not come out, then let him return his leg to the hot water and leave the blood to flow until it is emptied. If the phlebotomist misses the vein on the first attempt...
let him return to bleeding a little higher, for the place is safe and there is no fear of harm from it if you are careful of the nerve, as we said. And you do the same with the saphenous vein of the other leg, exactly. As for the sciatic vein, its location is, as we said, at the heel from the lateral side.
And the benefit of bleeding it is for hip pain, if that is from hot blood. And its method of bleeding is that you put the patient in the bath and hasten and tie his leg from the hip to above the heel with four fingers' width of a thin, long bandage, for it will not appear except by that.
Then, if it appears, bleed it in whichever way you are most comfortable, either by twisting, which is better, or by amputating it or cutting it; for its location is safe. And it is very hidden in most people. If you do not find it...
and it does not appear at all to the touch, then bleed some of its branches, which are those that appear on the back of the foot toward the little finger and ring finger, and be careful of the nerves, and release the amount of blood that you want.
Then untie the bandage and place cotton on the place of bleeding and bind the place, for it will quickly heal.
Chapter ninety-six.
Concerning cupping and its method of use.
Cupping instruments may be made of horns, wood, brass, or glass, and cupping is of two types: one is cupping with incision and the extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without incision.
And this cupping without incision is of two types.
And the cupping of the sides of the neck on both sides, and the cupping of the chin, which is below the lower jaw of the mouth, and the cupping of the shoulders, and the cupping of the coccyx at the base of the spine, and the cupping of the forearms, which are the middles of the arms, and the cupping of the legs, and the cupping of the heels.
Cupping draws blood from the small veins spread throughout the flesh, and for that reason it does not weaken the body as much as bloodletting, and cupping, whether with fire or without, should not be used in any illness that is caused by fullness until the whole body is purged.
If the need for cupping arises from illness or custom, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle of it, or at any time.
That is because some people, when their blood increases to the point that it needs to be removed by cupping, feel heaviness and headache in their heads, and some feel fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck, and some feel itching in their face and sides, darkness and pain in their eyes, and some itch in the place of their cupping.
And some laugh a lot, and some find the taste of blood in their mouths, their gums swell, and they spit blood, and some sleep a lot, and some see blood, redness, killing, and wounds in their sleep, and things like that.  When we see any of that…
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we order cupping then after two or three hours of the day have passed. As for the benefit of cupping the temples, it benefits from heaviness in the head and water pouring into the eyes.
But it should be after emptying the whole body. This cupping may be a substitute for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.  It is warned against using it for someone who is cold-brained or has a cold, for it will harm him greatly.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold diseases in their heads should not use it, and those who habitually use it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, the cupper should be ordered to lower his hand with the cupping glass a little lower, for fear of producing forgetfulness. As for cupping the nape of the neck, it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic and cephalic veins.
Therefore, it benefits from asthma, shortness of breath, rupture of the respiratory apparatus, cough, and fullness.  The cupping of the nape of the neck should be raised a little, for if it is lowered, it will produce weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the mastoid processes, it benefits from pains occurring in the head, ophthalmia, migraine, angina, and toothache. It is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic vein. The cupper should be ordered not to deepen his hand with the lancet, lest he cut a vein and cause bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it benefits from thrush in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases in the mouth. It may replace phlebotomy of the labial veins.  As for cupping the shoulders, it benefits from palpitations that result from fullness and heat.
As for cupping the insides of the forearms, it benefits from what benefits phlebotomy of the three veins—the basilic, cephalic, and median—because it draws blood from all those small veins in the flesh and draws those small veins from other thicker veins, until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
The cupper should be ordered not to go too deep with the lancet, because the area is devoid of flesh and underneath are nerves and arteries. As for the single cupping performed on the coccyx, it benefits from hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
The cupper should be ordered to use a large cupping glass, and it should be made of copper, because the area needs strong suction, and a glass cupping glass might break and require many incisions.  As for cupping the legs, it noticeably reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the whole body, it benefits from chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; it promotes menstruation; it benefits from boils and abscesses; and it replaces phlebotomy of the saphenous veins and the veins of the ankles. However, it greatly weakens the body and causes fainting in most people. The benefit of cupping the ankles is similar to the benefit of cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping glasses is that the cupping glass is first placed empty and moderate suction is applied. Do not prolong the application of the cupping glasses, but rather apply and remove them quickly so that the humors are drawn to the area evenly. Continue to repeat this until you see that the area has reddened and opened.
When the redness of blood appears, then make an incision and resume suction slowly. Then consider the state of the bodies. For those whose flesh is loose and porous, it should be incised only once, lest the area ulcerate.
Order the cupper to widen the incision and deepen it slightly, and to adjust the suction gently and with delicate movement. If the blood is thick, it should be incised twice; the first time to open a path for the thin, watery blood, and the second time to completely remove the thick blood.
If the blood is very turbid, the incision should be repeated a third time to achieve the goal. In general, if we want to remove a small amount of blood, we are content with one incision; if we want to remove a large amount of blood, we make more incisions, especially if we estimate that the blood is thick.
Then it is necessary to make a deep incision; the moderate limit of the incision is only the depth of the skin.  What should be used of ointments when applying cupping glasses, and of waters, and what the cupped person should avoid. As for someone whose skin is thick, hard, dry and whose pores are tight,
the places for the cupping glasses should be anointed with opening, softening, and resolving ointments.  If it is in the summer, then such as rose ointment, violet ointment, sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
And if it is in the winter, then such as daffodil ointment, iris ointment, chamomile ointment, or lily and the like. If the waste matter is thick and cold, let the ointment be marjoram ointment, or balm ointment, or benzoin ointment, or storax ointment, and the like.
If the cupped person has wide pores and soft flesh, then the ointment should be avoided. These should wash their cupping places after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with gooseberry water, or with gourd water, or with chickweed water, and the like. As for someone whose blood is very moist,
he should wash his cupping places with vinegar, or with water of spikenard and sumac, and the like. As for someone whose waste matter is thick, he should wash his cupping places with old wine, or with marjoram water, or a decoction of storax, or chamomile, and the like.  Cupping should be avoided in the bathhouse and immediately after the bathhouse.
Rather, it should be used after leaving the bathhouse after an hour or two. No one should sleep after cupping.  What the cupped and bled person should manage before and after cupping.
First, it is necessary to look. If the cupped or bled person is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation prevail in his blood, then he should take refrigerants such as pomegranate and dandelion with vinegar, lettuce, oxymel, and sherbet, and the like.  And he should make his foods from poultry and lamb stews, and sour things and the like.
And if his temperament is cold, then he should be given honeyed drinks and quince drinks or seed oxymel, and he should consume moderately fragrant wine, that which is between old and new. He should be ordered to eat little, and his food should be poultry, partridges, sparrows, and pigeon squabs, stewed.  And the drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting should be more than the food.
And it may be necessary to give some people, at certain times, some of the antidote of Faruq, or musk medicine, or Theriac, before cupping and before or after bloodletting, to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood.  It should not be given to those who are feverish.
As for cuppings which are without a condition, they are the cuppings which are placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, the region of the kidneys, and the hip joint, for these organs do not tolerate a condition being applied to them. Rather, what is intended by them is either drawing blood from one organ to another.
Such as placing the cupping glass on the breasts in the case of epistaxis, or we use it to remove cold wind which has become lodged in an organ, such as placing the cupping glass on the abdomen and navel, for it loosens the organ, warms it, and removes the pain by resolving that wind.
And it may be placed on the kidneys if an obstruction or stone appears in them, for by the force of its drawing it may perhaps open the obstruction or dislodge the stone from its place.  And so it acts if placed on the liver and spleen in the case of wind that disturbs them. And these cuppings may be used empty, with only suction.
It may be used with fire, and it may be used filled with lukewarm water in cases of inflammation, so that the cupping glass, and let it be large, is filled with hot water alone, or with water in which some herbs suitable for this have been boiled.
Then, filled, it is placed on the place, held, and removed, and repeated several times according to need. And this is the image of the cupping glass which is used with fire:
Its mouth should be the width of two open fingers, as we have depicted, and its depth about half a span, and in its side, about halfway up, a small hole, about the size that a needle will enter, made of Chinese copper or yellow copper, with a thick rim.
Smooth, even, and polished, lest it injure the member when placed upon it, and in its middle a transverse groove of copper or iron, where the lighted candle is placed. And this cupping glass may be made larger than we have described, or smaller, according to the illnesses.
And the manner of its use: for the cupping glasses of boys and thin people are not the cupping glasses of men and those with full bodies.  As for the manner of placing this cupping glass with fire on the member, it is that you prepare a lighted wick of tightly-woven linen or a small candle of pitch and place it on the middle of the solidified rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass.
So that the ascent of the fire will be upwards towards the bottom of the cupping glass, lest the body of the patient be burned. Then it is placed on the member, and the finger on the hole which we mentioned, so that when we have held the cupping glass as long as we need, the finger is removed.
And the vapor will exit through that hole, and the cupping glass will adhere to the place. Then you prepare the wick in the same way and reapply it if you need to. As for the cupping glass which is used in the treatment of *shousha* with water, it does not have a solidified rod nor a hole.
Rather, it is used by filling it with water and placing it on the member only. And this is its image:
And this cupping glass, the larger it is to contain much water, the better it is.
Chapter ninety-seven.
On the suspension of the leech.
Leeches are used mostly in cases where cupping glasses cannot be applied, either because of smallness, like the lip and gum and the like, or because the member is devoid of flesh, like the finger and nose and the like.
And the method of using them is that you choose leeches which are in pure fresh water, free from impurities, then leave them a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry and nothing remains in their bellies. Then the body is first purged by bloodletting or cupping, then the affected member is wiped.
Until it reddens, then it is placed upon it.  When it is full, it falls off. And if it is possible to suck the place with a cupping glass, it is more effective; otherwise, wash the place with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and rub and squeeze it. If the bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and it is a trickle, then let a linen cloth be dipped in cold water.
And place it on top until the trickle stops. If the bleeding is excessive, sprinkle on it powdered vitriol or gallnut or similar astringents until the bleeding stops, or place on the place halves of peeled lupins.
And leave it until the lupin sticks to the place, for then the bleeding will stop. And it is preferable, if it is necessary to reapply leeches, not to reapply those leeches if others are available. If the leeches refuse to attach, let the place be wiped with fresh blood.
Or a needle is inserted into the place until some blood comes out, then it is placed, for when it senses some blood it will stick in place.  If you want it to fall off, sprinkle on it some aloe, or salt, or ash, then it will fall off in place.
Chapter Three.
On setting (bones).
This chapter also deals with what is needed in the art of medicine, namely the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Know, my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never looked at a book of the ancients on it, nor read a letter of it.
For this reason, this art of knowledge has become nonexistent in our country, and I have never encountered anyone at all who was skilled in it. And I have only acquired what I have acquired from my long reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them, until I extracted knowledge of this from them; then I adhered to experience and practice throughout my life.
And I have drawn for you in this chapter everything that my knowledge encompasses. And my experience has passed over it after I have brought it closer to you and freed it from the branches of prolixity, and shortened it to the utmost, and clarified it to the utmost, and depicted for you in it many images of the instruments which are used in it.
For it is from an increase in explanation, as I did in the preceding two chapters, and there is no strength except in God, the Most High, the Magnificent.
The first chapter.
In it are summaries and compendia concerning the matter of fractured bones, and it is necessary to present them.  And before we begin to mention the fractured and dislocated members one by one, it is necessary that we mention at the beginning of this chapter summaries of speech and sections. It compels you first to understand them and to stand upon their reality, you and whoever else is eager to learn this noble craft.
So I say that when a fracture, dislocation, wound, or fall occurs to someone, it is necessary to hasten first to bloodletting or purging, or both. Unless something prevents it, such as weakness, or the one to whom this has happened is a child or a very old man, or the time is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then he should restrict his diet to cold legumes and the meat of birds and gazelles, and he should avoid drink, strong meats, and overeating, and every food that fills the veins with blood, until the swelling is safe and the flow of material to the location is not expected.
Then let the patient return to his first regimen, which was his custom.  When the broken bone begins to knit, then the patient should be nourished with foods that provide abundant, strong, and firm nourishment, which has viscosity, such as porridges, rice, heads, necks and cow stomachs. And eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and the like, for by this treatment the consolidation of the fracture will be quicker and better. And know that broken bones, if they are in strong men and old men, cannot ever unite and join in their first nature.
Because of the dryness and hardness of their bones. And what was of bones in the utmost softness, like the bones of small children, may unite and join together; but nature grows on the broken bone from all its sides something resembling glue, thick, which adheres to it and tightens it until some of it adheres to the other.
And it binds some of it to some of it until it comes to the utmost strength and firmness as it was at first, so that nothing hinders him from his actions.
For this reason it is necessary to give the patient food which has firmness, viscosity and thickness, as we said. And know that fractures differ in their kinds according to the difference of the members, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the breast bone is different from a fracture of the back bone.
And so also all the other members, each differing from the other. And we shall come to the mention of each kind of fracture, explained in its chapter, detailed from the others. And the kind of fracture of the bone itself may also differ.
For its fracture may be a splintering without any fragments being produced, and its fracture may be along the length of the bone, and its fracture may have fragments and excrescences, separated and unseparated. And the fracture may be with a wound and perforation in the skin, and the fracture may be a slight crack.
And for each kind there is a special method in its setting, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. And among the things by which a fracture of the bone is recognized are its crookedness, its swelling, its appearance to the touch, and its roughness when you probe it with your hand.
Then when there is neither apparent crookedness nor roughness in the place, nor do you feel any disturbance in the bone when you feel it, and the patient does not feel much pain, then there is no fracture, but it may be a sprain, or a slight fracture, or a slight crack.  Therefore you should not move it at all by pulling and probing.
But apply to it of the medicaments, the mention of which will come after a while, what suits the place, then bind it gently. And know that if the bone is broken and cracked into two without any fragments being produced, except that each part has separated from its fellow.
Then it is necessary for you to hasten at once to set it and straighten it before a hot swelling occurs to it.  If a hot swelling occurs to it, then leave it for some days until the hot swelling subsides, then straighten it in any way you are able with gentleness and skill.
And know that its setting and straightening is easier than a bone in which fragments have occurred. Then it is bound as will be mentioned.  If there are fragments in the bone, then it is necessary to pull the broken limb from both sides, whether it be hand or foot.
Either with your hands, if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand. And let your placing of the limb be on a level surface in its natural shape, so that when the broken part of the bone is extended, then replace those fragments in their places in any way you are able with skill and gentleness.
And strive with all your effort that you do not cause the patient pain or suffering by your actions, and strive with all your effort to join one bone to the other in the best way. It is necessary at that time to touch them and feel them with your hand, and if you see something irregular, correct and straighten it to the best of your ability.
And beware of strong pulling and forceful probing, as many ignorant people do, and they often cause by their actions a hot swelling or stiffness in the limb, as I have witnessed many times from their actions.
Then, after the setting, perfection, and binding, keep that limb still and quiet, and warn the patient not to move it while awake or asleep, and when turning and restlessness, and when defecating, and in all his movements as much as possible, and let him be careful that the position of the limb is a position where he will be safe from pain.
And that is because whenever he feels pain or suffering in the position of the limb, he should move it to another position where he does not feel pain, and he should be careful that this position is level and straight.
Lest there be a deformity in the limb when it heals. As for the method of binding the broken limb, it is as I describe to you. Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness and largeness and their forms. Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and the like.
Then the bandages should be soft and gentle; and those that are thick, like the thigh, back, and chest, then the bandages should be wide and firm, because a wide bandage is necessary for a large limb and binds it from every side with equal tightness, so that no defect interferes.
Then, after you have finished the setting, you begin to apply the appropriate plaster. In a soft manner on the place of the fracture, then you begin to wrap the bandage on the place of the fracture itself three or four times, according to what the limb requires, and you tighten your hand slightly with the bandage, then you take it to the upper side of the place of the fracture.
With less tightening than your tightening of the broken area, then you spread the wrapping away from the place of the fracture a little and loosen the tightening little by little until you take from the correct place something suitable, then you take another bandage and wrap it also on the broken place.
wraps, then you take the wrap to the lower side of the fracture, and let your action in tightening and loosening the wrap be as we mentioned in the first upper wrap, then you place between the bandages from the soft padding or rags what straightens the crookedness of the fracture.
If there is crookedness, otherwise do not put anything in it, then wrap another bandage around it, then straighten on these bandages the firm splints immediately if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, then apply what calms that inflammation and removes the swelling, and leave it for days, then tighten the splints on it then, and let the splints be from broad, carved, skillfully prepared halves of reeds, or let the splints be from sieve wood.
which are made from pine or palm stalks or  boxwood or similar things that are available, and let the width of each splint be in this form and this shape exactly.
Except that the splint which is placed on the fracture itself should be a little thicker and wider than the other splints, and as for the length of the splint, it is made according to what suits the broken limb, in its size and smallness, the image of the splint:
Then tighten the splints with another bandage, according to your first tightening exactly, then tie from above with firm threads according to what we mentioned of the tightening, which is that your tightening on the place of the fracture should be more. And the farther it is from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and thinness, and let them be of wet linen especially, because if the threads are thick, as I have seen done by the ignorant, who make their threads from twisted linen strips, it is a great mistake.
Because the tightening with them is excessive, and thin threads are also unsuitable, because you do not achieve with them the tightening you want, and there should not be less than a finger between the splint and the splint.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after tightening in the healthy places, place under them soft tow or fluffy wool so that nothing harms him from that; and as for if the fracture is with a wound and a rupture occurs in the skin, we will mention it separately.
Know that not every broken limb should be tightened with splints from the first day, and that if the limb is large, the splints should not be placed on it except after five or seven days or more, according to your certainty that hot swelling will not occur.
And this is a description of the bandages with which the ancients used to bind fractures, dislocations, and sprains; a description of a general, brief bandage that binds fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is something that is not overcome by heat or cold.
And it is that you take from the dust of the mill, which is the essence of the flour that adheres to the walls of the mill during the movement of the millstone, then knead it as it is without sifting it, with egg white, and make its kneading neither thick nor thin, then apply it.
A description of another bandage that sets fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take of mastic, leadwort, acacia, resin, gum tragacanth, and sugar, ten drachms of each; and of myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; and of the lote tree, twenty drachms; and of Armenian or Roman clay, twenty drachms. Pound everything and mix it with lote water or with egg white if the patient's temperament is hot, then use this bandage, for it is good in its composition, quickly sets broken bones, and is suitable for most people because of its moderation.
A description of another bandage that is also useful for fractures and sprains: take gum tragacanth, mastic, and white leadwort, ten drachms of each; myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; acacia, six drachms; Armenian clay, twenty drachms. Pound everything finely, sift it, and knead it with water or egg white and use it.
A description of a bandage for joints and bones that have shifted from their places, and it soothes the pain that occurs in them, and for bone cracks and fractures: take purified wool and dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply it to the affected area. This bandage does not have bone-setting power.
But it is excellent in soothing hot swelling and relieving pain especially. A description of another bandage that sets broken bones: take the leaves of the black mulberry and the leaves of wild poppy, and pound them together, and bandage with them while moist. A description of another brief bandage used when a bone fracture is healing.
And if you want to resolve the rest of the swelling, take of the root of leadwort, chamomile, violet flowers, and crushed acorns, one part of each. Pound everything together and knead it with white of egg if the member is not inflamed; if it is inflamed, knead it with coriander water or water and use it.
A description of another bandage stronger in resolving than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs during bone healing: take of the root of leadwort, flaxseed, fenugreek, rosemary, marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile, one part of each.
Pound everything together and knead with vinegar water, or with fresh water, or with white of egg, all according to the heat of the member and the stillness of its inflammation.  As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that it should be placed on the broken member when setting it.
Except for the cerate made only from wax and oil, and he described it as being of a consistency midway between thick and thin. As for Galen, he was of the opinion that things containing drying agents with some heat should be placed on the broken member when setting it, such as myrrh, aloes, frankincense, and similar things that we mentioned.
A description of a bandage beneficial for weakness and pain: take of alum, chickpea flour, human hair that is shorn or bird feathers, leadwort, and salt, equal parts. Pound, sieve, knead, and bandage with it. As for the amount that the bandage should remain...
Then it is to be loosened; that is to say, you should observe: if no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place occurs in the patient, do not loosen it for many days. If, however, intense itching, worrying pain, or swelling occurs in the place…
then hasten to loosen it at once and do not delay that at all, and remove the bandage from it. Then take a soft cloth or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the place with it until the itching and pain subside. Then let the member rest for an hour.
Then apply pledgets of carded wool dipped in vinegar and oil or rose oil and bind it on for a night, until you are sure the hot swelling has subsided, the swelling of the member has ceased, and its pain has gone. Then return it to gentle traction and light bandaging, but do not bind it as tightly as at first.
And treat it gently until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and inflammation, and all the symptoms have completely disappeared, and you need bandaging and traction, then reapply it as you did at first, equally. If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs in the member…
then do not loosen it except after three, four, five, or seven days, and it may be left for twenty days; all this according to what appears to you of the condition of the member, as we said, until the fracture is set and the flesh begins to consolidate upon it.
Then also increase the traction more than your first traction, and also increase the nourishment of the patient beyond what has been mentioned. If you see the place of the fracture has dried and atrophied more than it should, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Then bathe it with lukewarm water each time you loosen it, and let this be every three days, and lessen the traction a little. For by this action nourishment will flow to the member and it will heal quickly.  As for what ignorant bone-setters do, of breaking the member again…
if it is not set properly at first, and is set crookedly, that is an error in their action and a great deception. And if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and acted upon it, and I have seen no trace of it at all from any of them. And the correct thing is not to do it.
Chapter Two.
Concerning accidental fractures in the head.
The types of accidental fractures in the head are numerous, their forms varied, and their causes diverse.  Some fractures are caused by a sword blow, and this may either sever the bone entirely to the point of reaching the membrane beneath the bone. Just as an axe does to wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called axe-like.  Alternatively, the sword may cut some of the bone and sever only its surface, without the cut penetrating to the end; this type of fracture is called an absolute extraction. The wound in these two fractures may be either large or small.
And there are fractures which are comminuted or contused; their cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone or something similar. This fracture may be penetrating, nearly reaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be only on the surface of the bone.
The wound in these two fractures is also either large or small. And there are fractures that are hidden in the bone, as fine as a hair; this is a slight crack.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called hair-like. There is also a fracture caused by a fall or a blow from a stone or the like, which drives a section of the bone inwards, and the area becomes concave, as happens to a copper pot when struck, a part of it being driven inwards.
This most often occurs in the moist bones of the head, such as the heads of children. All these types of fracture may have loose and non-loose fragments.  We will describe the treatment of all of them in their proper place.  We recognize all these types of fracture by examining them.
And examining them with probes and removing the corrupted flesh from them. As for the hair-like type, it is recognized by examining the bone, wiping it and smearing it with ink; the fracture will appear black. As for the treatment of fractures, first look at the symptoms of the patient.
If you see among his symptoms those which clearly indicate danger, such as vomiting bile, distension, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, sunken and reddened eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat him, for death is inevitable with these symptoms in most cases.
But if you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for his safety, then begin his treatment.  And that is, if the wounded man comes to you immediately after the injury, and this is in the winter months.
Then you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case.  And if it is in the summer months, then you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone spoils and those symptoms which we described appear.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is crushing and contusion, then you should cut away the crushed and contused part as I describe to you; that is, shave the head of the wounded patient.
And uncover the bone in whatever way is possible for you, and according to the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient. If, when uncovering the bone, you find bleeding or hot swelling, treat that as is appropriate.
That is, pack the place with cloths soaked in a potion and rose oil, and clean the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then begin to chisel away the bone and extract it; this can be done in one of two ways.
As for the first method, it is to cut the bone with a fine saw with a narrow blade.  And this is its image:
Then use another saw after this one, a little wider. And this is its image:
Then also use another saw, wider still than the second. It is necessary that you have a number of saws of different sizes, some wider than others and some shorter than others, and that they be extremely sharp at their edges. Let them be made of Indian iron or good steel.
And use gentleness in striking the saw, lest you shake the head and injure it. If the bone is strong and solid, then it is necessary that you bore around it before using the saws, with the borers which are called non-immersive borers.  They are called non-immersive borers.
Because they do not go beyond the limit of the skull bone to what is behind it, for the borer has a round edge below its sharp head, similar to a small ring or circle, preventing it from sinking and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
And it is necessary for you to have many of these borers, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you have for every skull a borer whose sharp end is suitable in length and shortness for the thickness of that skull.  And this is an image of three types. Of the borers: large, medium, and small.
As for the method of boring around the fractured bone, it is that you place the borer on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then you move the borer to another place, and you make the distance between each hole the size of the thickness of an awl or similar.
Then you cut between each two holes with the cutters, and you do this with the utmost gentleness as we said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with something else from some of the instruments prepared for that.
Such as forceps and delicate hooks. And you should be very careful that the borer or cutter does not touch anything of the peritoneum. If the bone is cleaned and freed from the peritoneum, if it was adhering to it, and you remove it, then you should dress it.
And smooth the roughness of what remains of the bone with another instrument similar to the cutter, except that it should be thinner and more delicate than the other cutters.  If anything remains of the small bones and splinters, then take them gently with the instruments you have.
Then you treat the wound afterwards with cauterization and the ointments which will be mentioned. As for the other method, it is a very easy method, far from danger; Galen mentioned it and praised it greatly, and this is what he said. First, you should begin by uncovering the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and evident, until, when you have uncovered that part, you place the tip of this lenticular cutter underneath it, and this is its image:
Its lenticular part should be smooth so that it does not cut anything, and its sharp part should be on its sides extending lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests against the peritoneum and the face of the sharp cutter on the bone. Then you strike the cutter from one side.
With a small hammer until you cut all the bone gently as it rotates, and you are safe from the membrane, with no fear of an accident whatsoever, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he were sleepy.
If anything of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some parts of the bone, then scrape it off with the tip of the lenticular cutter itself, and carefully detach it, for it will detach without harm or fear.
But if the bone fracture did not penetrate to the membrane, and what was broken of the bone was its surface, and roughness and small fragments remained in it, then you should remove that roughness and extract those fragments with fine forceps, of which various sizes have been made, so that you can use the most suitable and appropriate ones in each place, according to what the work requires.
And the same broken bone and its shape. You should use the widest of those forceps first to remove from the bone, then use a finer one after that, and continue to do so successively, until you come to use the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the other small, hair-like fissures and slight fractures, you should use for each one a treatment according to what leads to its improvement; this is something not hidden from anyone who has the least experience in this art and has understood what we have written and explained about large fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, then you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth. And dip it in syrup and rose oil and place it on the first cloth, and do this as gently as you can, lest you weigh down the peritoneum. Then use a wide bandage on top and do not tighten it except to the extent that it only holds the wound.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are sure that the hot swelling has subsided. Then remove it and use afterwards drugs with drying properties, such as the roots of iris, crushed cyclamen, crushed myrrh, and ziraund, and the like. You make suppositories from these drugs.
And sprinkle them on the wound as they are dry. In general, use a medicine that cleanses and does not sting.  In treating the wound, strive to keep it clean, free from grease and dirt, and do not allow pus to accumulate in it at all.
Because if pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts and festers it, causing great harm to the patient.  This can occur in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if treatment is neglected.
If blackness appears on its surface, and the patient exhibits the symptoms we have mentioned, know that he will inevitably die. However, if the blackness is caused by a medicine applied to it, and it was in the nature of that medicine to cause that blackness.
It is necessary to take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them well, smear a cloth with them, and apply it to the meninges. Then treat it with the appropriate types of treatment until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the reduction of a fractured nose.
Know that only the two upper parts of the nose, or one of them, can be fractured, because they are bone;  the lower part is cartilaginous and does not fracture, but rather is subject to contusion, crookedness, and flattening.
If one of its parts is fractured, then you should insert your little finger into the nostril and straighten the fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until you return the nose to its natural shape. Let this be done gently, being careful not to cause the patient pain.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, then it should be straightened with the end of a slightly thick probe. If the fracture is on both sides, do the same.  And let it be reduced on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, otherwise after seven or ten days, when the acute inflammation has subsided. Then insert a pledget of linen into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or two pledgets if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the pledget be of a thickness to fill the nostril. Some of the early bone-setters mentioned that the pledgets should be moistened with fat and changed every day, but I do not think this is necessary; rather, the pledgets should be moistened with egg white mixed with finely ground flour.
Then leave the pledgets until the bone is set and the cartilage hardens. Goose quills, wrapped in soft linen, may be inserted into the nose at the site of the pledgets; this will hold the fractured nose more firmly and prevent the patient from being unable to breathe.
This is not essential; you may do it or you may make pledgets. If acute inflammation occurs in the nose during your treatment, apply a compress of quince or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or some diachylon ointment.
If no acute inflammation occurs, you should dress it externally with semolina flour and finely ground myrrh mixed with egg white, then apply a soft bandage, but do not bind the nose at all, if the nasal bones are fractured slightly.
Or if they are splintered, you should make an incision and remove them with a suitable instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with appropriate ointments that promote healing. If a wound occurs inside the nose, you should treat it with pledgets and use lead tubes. until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On the setting of lower jaws if fractured.
If the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, then if the fracture is only external and it is not fractured in two and is not depressed inwards, then its identification is easy.
Then it is necessary, if the fracture is in the right side, that you insert the index finger of the left hand into the mouth of the patient, and similarly if the fracture is in the left side, then insert the index finger of the right hand and gently raise the edge of the fracture from the inside to the outside.
And with your other hand from outside the bone, you control it to straighten it. If the fracture of the jaw has been broken into two, then it is necessary to use traction from both sides until its straightening is achieved. If it has happened in the teeth, [a] protrusion.
Or if they are separated, then tie what you hope will remain with a gold, silver or silk thread, then place on the fractured jaw a pledget, then place on it a folded cloth, and place on the cloth a large, tight splint or a piece of leather the length of the jaw. Then tie it from above according to what seems suitable to you to tie it and agrees with its binding so that it does not become undone, and instruct the patient to rest and be still, and make his food soft drinks. If you think that something of the shape has changed in any way, then hasten to unbind it on the third day.
Then tie it from above according to what seems suitable to you to tie it and agrees with its binding so that it does not become undone, and instruct the patient to rest and be still, and make his food soft drinks. If you think that something of the shape has changed in any way, then hasten to unbind it on the third day. Then repair what you have bandaged with mill dust mixed with egg white or with semolina flour after removing the pledget from it, and place a soft compress on the bandage. As long as that bandage adheres to it and the condition of the bone does not change, leave it.
Do not unbind it until it heals and the fracture hardens. Often this fracture hardens in three weeks. If during that time a hot swelling appears, then use what we have repeatedly mentioned to calm it until that swelling goes away.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, look: if a splinter or splinters have become separated from the bone, then be gentle in extracting those splinters with whatever instrument is suitable for you to extract them. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, then widen it with the scalpel to the extent of your need.
Then, when you have extracted those splinters and nothing remains of them, stitch the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for that. And suture the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
In the reduction of the clavicle if it is fractured.
The clavicle is most often fractured in front, at the end of the shoulder, and its fracture is in one of three ways: either it is fractured and broken into two without splinters, which is easiest to set.
Or splinters occur in the fracture, which is more difficult to set; or the fracture may be accompanied by a wound.  The procedure, if the fracture is without a wound, is that you prepare two assistants, one to hold the arm next to the fractured clavicle, and the other to extend the neck toward the other side.
Then you set the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, and there is no protrusion or irregularity. If you need more extension, then you should place under the armpit of the patient a ball of rags or wool.
And its size should be according to your need.  You extend and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is set as it should be. If you are unable to pull the end of the clavicle outwards because it has gone inwards, then the patient should lie on his back.
And a moderately sized pillow is placed under his shoulder, and the assistant presses his shoulder downwards until the clavicle which is deep rises upwards. Then you correct the fracture and set it with your fingers.
If you feel that a splinter of the clavicle has broken and is moving, then you should incise over it and remove that splinter gently. If the splinter is embedded in the bone, then you should attempt to cut it with one of the instruments prepared for that purpose. After placing under the clavicle the instrument which protects the peritoneum, which is an instrument of wood or iron, and this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a bend. Its width should be according to the size of the bone, large or small, and its length also according to what is convenient for the work, and let it have two ends, as you see, one end wider and the other narrower.
If the wound opening which you incised when removing the bone splinter is wide and you are safe from hot inflammation, then join the edges of the wound with sutures.  If the opening is small or you fear hot inflammation, then dress the wound with lint and pledgets according to the size of the incision.
If hot inflammation occurs, moisten the lint in rose oil and vinegar or syrup and apply it. As for setting a bone if it is without a wound or incision, it is to apply to the bone a plaster made from mill dust with egg white. And you place the soft splint upon it, then you place the ball under his armpit if he needs that. Then take a bandage which is very long, and its width is a cubit or thereabouts, then apply a folded pledget over the splint and the plaster, then take a splint of thin wood. Let its width be three fingers and its length likewise, then insert it in a cloth, then insert that cloth with the splint in the part of the bandage which falls on the place of the fracture, then tighten the bandage on the fracture as you wind it. And pass it over his neck and under his sound armpit and under his affected armpit and pass it repeatedly on each side, and as you see that the tightening firmly fixes the fracture, which is not hidden from you.
And the whole point is that the splint does not move from the broken bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day; whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, correct that and tighten the bandage. Then let the patient sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.
So that his arm may be raised from his side, and the clavicle fracture may be raised with the raising of the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck, and do not untie the bandage unless something happens in the area such as itching or swelling, until twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason for it. Then return to the binding and leave it until the fracture of the clavicle heals and consolidates, and it strengthens and becomes more solid in twenty-eight days. And it may be in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six.
Concerning the setting of a fracture of the humerus.  The humerus rarely fractures in its wide part; rather, it fractures at its extremities.  Whenever a part of it is fractured, or it is fractured in its middle, this is known by touch.  Therefore, depending on the shape of the fracture, treat it accordingly.
Straighten it and restore it to its natural shape by any means you can, then apply to the place mill dust with egg white and soft lint, and place on top a pad of folded cloth, then apply a wide splint of wood.
Thin enough to cover the whole shoulder or slightly wider. If, under the splint, there is a prominence in any part of the shoulder, smooth out that prominence with soft lint until the splint lies evenly, then bandage firmly from above with a long bandage.
Bind it tightly and make sure the splint does not move from its place. Check the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and straighten the splint if it moves from its place. Let the patient lie on his sound side. The shoulder heals in twenty [days].
days or twenty-five days.  When this period is complete, remove the bandage safely, for it is among the bones whose shattering or displacement is not feared. If a fragment of bone protrudes and is pressing under the skin, incise over it and remove it. And do what was mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle to reduce the hot swelling if anything of that occurs.
Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of a fracture of the chest.
The chest may be fractured in its middle, though this rarely happens; but its extremities are more frequently fractured and shattered.  Among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, is that it inclines downwards, and there is intense pain, difficulty in breathing and coughing.
And perhaps blood is expelled, and the depression in the fractured bone is evident and not hidden from the sense of touch.  Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, and a pillow is placed between his shoulders; then his shoulders are compressed and the ribs are brought together by the hands from both sides, gently smoothing it in every way that is possible.
And continue until the shape of the bone is restored as it should be. Then apply a bandage and a splint, and place over it a splint of thin wood from willow or similar light wood, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then gently tie it over the fractured bone lest it shift; pass the bandage around to the back several times, and tighten it firmly. Then examine the bandage frequently, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.
And if necessity demands its removal due to an abscess appearing at the site, or pain or swelling, then proceed to remove it, and take off the bandage, and treat whatever has occurred in accordance with its treatment; then reapply the bandage if you see fit. And dress it and keep it firmly bound until it heals.
Chapter Eight.
Concerning the setting of fractured ribs: Know that fractures of the ribs occur in the thick parts adjacent to the back, and their extremities in front are subject to contusion because they are cartilaginous.  The knowledge of this is not hidden from the sense when examined with the fingers.
And set it by straightening the fracture with the fingers in a way that is possible, until the shape is as it should be; then bandage and bind the fractured bone with a splint if it needs it.  If the fracture of the ribs is inclined inwards, then severe pain will result for the patient.
And it will penetrate like the penetration which occurs to one with a chest wound, because the bone penetrates the diaphragm; and there also occurs for him shortness of breath, coughing, and the expulsion of much blood. This is difficult to treat, and the ancients devised many methods for it.
And some of them said that it is necessary to give the patient foods which produce flatulence and wind, so that the belly may swell and expand, and the fracture may be driven outwards. And we dislike this, lest it confirm the occurrence of hot inflammation if it has not occurred; and if it has occurred, then it increases it and confirms it.
And some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed on the place, then strongly sucked. This is more similar to reason, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will draw impurities to the place in its weakness. And some of them said that it is necessary to cover the place with wool which has been dipped in hot oil.
And make a bandage between the ribs until it is full, so that the binding is even when you wrap it around; then treat the patient with the treatment of a chest wound, as regards food and medicine. If the patient is burdened by a severe matter which he cannot endure, And the bone penetrates the diaphragm with a harmful penetration, and we feared for the patient. Therefore, it is necessary to incise the place and uncover the fractured rib, then place beneath it the instrument which protects the peritoneum, which has been described previously; and we cut the bone gently and remove it.
Then we bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and treat it with ointments until it heals.  If a hot inflammation appears in the meantime, then hasten and moisten bandages in rose oil, and place them on the place, and treat the patient internally with what calms the inflammation as well.
And he lies on the side on which sleep is easiest for him until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
On the setting of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture affects them—and this rarely happens to them, and contusions happen to them more often, and similarly to the vertebrae of the back as well—if this happens to someone and you want to know whether he will recover or not. Then look; and if you see that his hands have become relaxed, numb, and dead, and he is not able to move them, nor extend them, nor flex them, and if you pinch them or prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, nor does he find any pain in them, then know that he will not recover in most instances; he is dying.
And if he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking in them, then know that the marrow of the bone has been saved and that the patient will recover with treatment. If the vertebrae of the back are similarly affected and you want to know whether he will recover or not,
look at his legs; and if you see that they have become relaxed and what happened in the hands has happened in them, then if he lies on his back, wind and feces come out involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily, and if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he is unable to do so, then know that he is dying; do not trouble yourself with his treatment.  If none of this happens to him, the matter is less serious. The treatment for what has happened is that you aim to alleviate the hot swelling.
by placing on the injured vertebra rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks; apply this three times a day until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply to the place one of the strengthening, drying compresses, and bind it tightly, and order him to remain still and quiet.
And let him not sleep except on the side where he feels no pain until he recovers. If, at the time of the injury to the bone, a splinter or something has broken off from it, then it is necessary to incise the skin and extract that piece of bone. Then, if the wound is large, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures, and then treat it with cicatrizant ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the tailbone, is broken, then you should insert the thumb of the left hand into the rectum.
and set the broken bone with the other hand as far as you are able to achieve a setting; then apply a compress and splint if necessary, and then bind it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, then incise it and remove it, and treat the wound with the treatment previously described until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
Hip bones rarely fracture; but if they do fracture, it is in such a way that their extremities are shattered, they split lengthwise, and they incline inwards. The patient experiences pain at the site, numbness, and paralysis of the leg on the side of the fracture.
Its treatment is that you pass your hand over it until you ascertain the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only in its extremities, then set that fracture according to what seems best to you for its reduction, until its shape resembles its natural form.
If the fracture is lengthwise, or if it has inclined inwards, lay the patient on his stomach so that you may be able to set the fracture.  When you have set it, apply a bandage, and then apply a splint of wood or leather and bind it tightly.
Do not fear for him that the fracture will shift or the splint will come loose. Fill the hollow of the loins with something that will make it level, so that the binding may be even. Instruct the patient to lie on his back or his sound side. If a hot swelling occurs...
...then desist from setting and binding it until the hot swelling subsides. Apply something to calm it, as described above, then return to setting and binding it as is appropriate. If fragments or shattered pieces of bone remain, they should not be removed.
They should not be touched but smoothed from the outside, as we have said, and the binding should be left until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the setting of a fracture of the humerus.
The humerus is that which is between the elbow and the shoulder. If it is fractured, set it in one of two ways: one is to take a smooth, curved piece of wood of medium thickness, in this manner:
and you tie two bandages to its ends, then it is hung from a high place and the patient sits on a chair, then his broken arm is placed on the wood until his armpit is touching the middle of the curve of the wood, then something heavy is hung from above it.
Or a servant stretches it downwards, then the physician sets the fracture with both his hands until he returns the fracture to what is appropriate.  The other way is for the patient to lie on his back and his hand is hung from his neck with a bandage.
Then you order two servants, one to hold above the fracture with his hands and the other to hold below it, and each stretches to his side. And if you wish the stretching to be stronger, then tighten below the fracture with a bandage and above it with a bandage, and each of the servants stretches to his side.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, then the middle of the bandage should be under the armpit and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.  Likewise, if the fracture is near the elbow, then the bandage should be in that place and on the elbow itself.
Then you set the fracture gently without violence, until the fracture is set as it should be and unites well. Then you bandage it if no hot swelling appears. If a hot swelling appears, then leave bandaging it until the seventh day and place on it a moistened soft wool compress soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides, then you bandage it.  The method of bandaging is to apply the compress to the fracture, then apply a bandage of new cloth over the compress, then gather the arm to the upper arm itself and place his hand open on his shoulder.
And you apply the cloth and bandage to the upper arm and forearm so that the forearm acts as a splint, if nothing prevents you from this and nothing changes in the broken bone. If you fear that something might change, then use splints.
This is to place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints, and let there be the width of a finger between each splint.  Let the length of the splints be according to the fracture, with an addition of three fingers on each side.
Then tighten the splints with the tightening I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And that your tightening on the site of the fracture should be tighter.
And the farther from the fracture, the less the tightening. If you see that the placement of the splints and the tightening, as we said, is at the time of your setting the limb immediately, then do so.
And if you fear hot swelling, leave off the tightening and the splints until the seventh day, as we said. Then examine the bandage every three days, lest there occur in the place chafing or swelling, or the nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb by reason of excessive tightening.  Amend all this as we have mentioned.
But if you are confident that none of that will occur, then do not loosen the bandage except after many days. And let the patient lie on his back, his hand on his stomach, and let a moderately full cushion of wool be placed under the armpit.
And examine at every time, night or day, lest the shape of the broken limb be disarranged, or the bandage become loose. Amend all this with your effort. And make the patient's food in the order we have presented, that the food be initially light, until the bone begins to consolidate.
Then it is necessary to increase his food. For it is the custom of the arm and leg to consolidate in forty days. Then it is necessary to loosen [the bandage], and he should use the bath and be treated with the ointments which are suitable for this. If the fracture is serious and comminuted,
then do not loosen the bandage from him until fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, and they are called the ulna; one of them is small, and it is that which is next to the thumb, and the other is large, and it is situated under the small one from below.  So perhaps the larger ulna is broken alone, or the smaller one alone, and perhaps they are broken together.
And when the smaller upper ulna is broken, then its setting is easy and its healing is quicker. And when the lower ulna is broken, then its fracture is bad and its healing is difficult. And the worst is when the two bones are broken together.  If the bone which is broken is the smaller upper ulna,
then it is necessary for the physician, when setting it, to make its extension easy gently until he straightens it. And if the large ulna is that which is broken, then it is necessary to make its extension stronger. And if the two ulnas are both broken, then it is necessary to make the extension very much stronger.
And it is necessary that the shape of the hand, when it is being set and extended, be extended on a pillow, and the thumb of the hand should be above, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the other fingers, and the patient should sit squarely on himself.
And let the pillow be in front of him at a height so that the patient does not suffer difficulty.
Then a servant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another servant extends from above likewise. Then the physician straightens the bone until he returns it to the best shape he can.  If there are fragments in the fracture of the bone, then they are removed.
Return each fragment to its place to the best of your ability. If a fragment appears that is detached and is piercing the skin, and there is no hope of setting it, then make an incision upon it and extract it in the manner we described previously. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, then I have dedicated a chapter to that.
Then take the treatment for that from there. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of your setting, then apply a cloth with a poultice made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be moderate between thickness and thinness, and bind the cloth on it gently until the swelling subsides.
Then remove the poultice and apply the prepared bandage of mill dust with egg white. Then apply the splints; and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger. And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases.
Whether the fracture was in one forearm bone or in both forearm bones together, then make your binding at the site of the fracture stronger and tighter. And the farther you move the binding upwards or downwards, make the binding a little looser, as mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, and not very hard. And let the thread with which it is bound be of special linen, moderate between thinness and thickness, as we described. And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days.
If something happens that needs to be corrected, such as an itching that appears in the limb, then the limb should be washed with warm water until that itching subsides, and the limb should be left unbound for a night so that it rests, then the binding should be resumed.
If the binding has loosened and the bone has shifted or something like that, then correct all of that to the best of your ability. And also look, if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness, then it should be loosened slightly and left for a few days until nourishment flows to it, then tighten it.
If nothing of what we mentioned happens to the patient, then it should not be unbound except after twenty days or so. Then, hang the patient's hand to his neck, and let his arm be straight, and he should carefully avoid turbulent movements, and let his sleep be on his back.
And know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days; all that depends on the conditions of the temperaments and the conditions of strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the setting of a fracture of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpus of the hand and the phalanges of the fingers rarely suffer fracture, but rather they often suffer contusion.  So when a fracture or contusion happens to the hand,
the patient should sit squarely, and before him a chair levelly.
Then he places his hand upon it outstretched, then the surgeon extends the broken bones and sets them, until when they are well-set, then it is necessary to apply a bandage and a splint, if a hot inflammation does not occur; then a splint is applied from above according to the place.
And it is inserted into a soft rag. If the fracture is downwards towards the palm of the hand, then make a kind of sphere from a rag and instruct the patient to grasp it with his broken hand, then it is tightened with a long rag.
And let the splint be of soft leather so that it conforms to the skin with the bending of the whole hand, and tighten it as necessary. If the fracture is outwards, then it is necessary to place a splint above and another splint below in the hand so that the hand is open and straight.
Then the bandage is applied as the hand turns and interlaces between the fingers with the ligature. If the fracture occurs in one of the finger joints, if it is the thumb, then let it be set as it should be, then it is bandaged with the hand; and if you wish to make for it a small, upright splint to support the fracture.
And it does not move. If the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little or ring finger, then let them be set and bound with the adjacent sound finger, or bind them all together, this is better, or place a small upright splint upon them.
As we said in the thumb, and examine during your setting and afterwards for hot swelling, then treat it as necessary whenever anything of that occurs, as has been repeatedly described.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the setting of a fractured thigh.
The thigh bone frequently fractures and is apparent to the touch because it moves forwards and backwards.  Its setting is by tightening a bandage above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, the patient lying on his face.
Then each bandage is extended to its side evenly. This is if the fracture is in the middle of the bone; but if it is near the head of the femur, then it is necessary to tighten a soft bandage, either of wool or similar.
At the head of the femur towards the pubis so that the extension is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, let the bandage be near the knee so that the extension is downwards. Then the physician straightens the bone with both hands until he returns it to its natural form.
And the bone unites well. Then it is necessary to maintain the bandage and tightening, unless a hot inflammation occurs in the limb. If inflammation occurs, leave it for a few days until the hot inflammation subsides, then return to its treatment.
As for its tightening, it is necessary to wrap a firm, wide bandage around the fracture two or three times, and what remains is left. Then the leg is bent until the heel reaches the ischium, and a long thread is passed between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, the ends of the thread being above on both sides.
Then wrap around the leg and thigh what remains of the bandage. Then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself, and place one splint on the leg bone.  Then stuff the space between the thigh and leg with soft rags so that the tightening is even.
Then begin with strong tightening from the middle at the site of the fracture, three or four turns.  The farther the bandage is from the site of the fracture, the less strong, softer, and looser your tightening should be.
Then take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie with it what is next to it of the splints from above. Then pass the ends of the thread downwards until you reach the heel of the foot, and also tighten with them the ends of the splints from the other side.
So that the bandage does not move from its place. Then leave the tightening on it as long as no pain, swelling, or puffiness, and the like, occurs in the limb. If any of that happens, quickly untie it and correct whatever occurred, as we have repeatedly mentioned.
If there is a protruding bone splinter, you should smooth it if you can. Otherwise, incise over it, remove it, and treat the wound as previously described until it heals. This fracture of the thigh may be set without adding the leg with splints.
As we mentioned in the humerus and forearm, except that its setting in this way does not cause lameness for the patient.  But if you set it alone without adding the leg, it is inevitable that its owner will limp forever.
Know that the thigh heals in fifty days, or a little more or less; all that depends on the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the fracture of the kneecap.
Fracture of the kneecap rarely occurs, but it is often bruised. If a fracture does occur, it is either a crack or a shattering into fragments; and this happens with or without a wound.
You will ascertain all this by touch, and you will treat it by aligning the separated fragments with your fingers until they are joined and united, as far as careful and gentle manipulation allows; then apply a dressing, and a circular splint if necessary.
Then tighten the appropriate bandage over it, and treat all the conditions we described in the case of other fractures, such as hot swelling and the like, counteracting each symptom with its appropriate remedy until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the treatment of leg fractures.
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula; they are subject to the same types of fracture as the bones of the arm. Therefore, its treatment is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are fractured, the leg is displaced in all directions; if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is displaced forward; and if the thicker bone is fractured lower down, the result is obvious.
Therefore use extension and reduction, and apply splints accordingly, except that if the leg fracture is severe with many fragments, extension should be gentler and lighter, and you should take great care in its treatment.
In treating the leg there is something additional to the treatment of the arm: when you have set the splints and completed all your work, take two splints of pine wood, such as are used in smoothing walls, which are placed between cracks in the planks, or they may be made from palm leaves or similar material.
Choose those of moderate thickness, not too thin, and let their length be that of the leg from the knee downwards. Then wrap each one twice lengthwise with a cloth, and place one on each side of the leg.
Let them extend from the knee to the lower part of the foot, then bind the splints in three places, at the ends and in the middle. By this means the leg is prevented from tilting to either side and is well supported; a wooden gutter may also be used along the length of the leg.
It is placed in this to keep it from moving, and it is especially necessary to do this in fractures accompanied by a wound. Then examine the leg every day and treat it with the greatest care against swelling, inflammation, or other complications. Whenever any such complication arises, treat it accordingly until it heals.  A leg fracture consolidates in about thirty days, or thereabouts.
Chapter Seventeen.
On fractures of the bones of the leg and toes.
As for the heel, it is never fractured; as for the bones of the leg, they may be fractured, and the toes also are rarely fractured, but rather are more often bruised.
If a fracture occurs in the bones of the leg and you see that some of those bones are overriding others, then let the patient place his foot flat on the ground as if walking, then you put your foot on the elevated part of those bones, and then press down and set them.
until they return to their places, then apply a bandage and splint from above, and place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot, then bind the foot firmly after wrapping it with cloths and whatever else is needed.
Then if three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones straight whether they were fractured or dislocated. The procedure is as you see.  As for if some of the toes are fractured, set them and align them according to what I described to you in setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the fractured toe along the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider than it, then place under the foot the board that I described to you and bind it firmly. If what was fractured of the bones was two or three or more,
then make for each toe a splint of appropriate size, wrapped in soft cloth, and bind the board to the bottom of the foot, and let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot so that it is well secured.
And you should not forget to attend to all that we mentioned to you in other fractures, from the symptoms that we mentioned, and treat each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of the woman's pubis and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, seat her cross-legged, then slowly bend her slightly backwards, and let her be supported from behind; then let the midwife pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and forms a ball within her vulva.
Then the woman is shaken and her hip is raised little by little; then that cotton will come out until it is at the opening of the vulva like a ball, and the fracture of the bone will be reduced. Then place a pad on her back; and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton gently so that she may urinate.
And return it in the manner in which it was first inserted, then return to her first pad. Do this for seven days or so, then it will heal. And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a tube to its mouth, and insert the entire bladder into her vulva.
Then blow forcefully into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva; then the fracture will be reduced. Then pack it with cotton and leave it as described until it heals. As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, the same treatment is used for its reduction.
And its setting is as we described for the hip bone.  The correct treatment of these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, especially for one who has some experience and understands this book well, will not be hidden from you, for the fracture itself indicates the treatment in most cases.
Understand the correct way to set and bind it. As for a fractured penis, take a goose's gullet, insert the penis into it, then apply a bandage of cloth, bind it, and leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the reduction of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Whoever suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus, or similar, should immediately be bled if the conditions for bleeding, as we have previously explained, are favorable.
If the wound bleeds, you should immediately stop it by applying powdered verdigris if nothing else is available, then proceed with setting the fracture that very day; do not delay it.
If no hot inflammation occurs, good. But if hot inflammation occurs, delay setting it until the ninth day, until the hot inflammation subsides. Do not touch it at all on the third and fourth days, for it will expose it to unfavorable conditions.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin and exposed, you should try to gently reduce and align it with your hands, using slight traction. If you cannot reduce and align it with your hands, reduce it with this instrument, which is made of iron, about seven or eight fingers long. And its width should be according to the wound.
Therefore, the physician should have three or four of them, according to what he needs for treatment in each type of fracture. Let them be round, with slight thickness, so that they do not bend when force is applied during the procedure.
And let the end be sharp, with a curve at its tip, and let the upper part be thicker, and from its middle downwards, much thinner.  This is its image:
It is called in Greek *peron*, meaning a small lever.  The sharp, curved end should be placed on the end of the protruding bone and pushed gently until the bone returns and is somewhat aligned, then align the ends of the fracture with each other.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grasp it well, then the end of that bone should be cut until the instrument can grasp it. If you are still unable to reset the bone as we described, cut it with similar cuts to those we mentioned.
Or spread it with one of the saws, however you can. Then, remove any roughness and thin scales remaining on the bone. If, after resetting it, the patient feels severe, persistent pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to return it to its natural position, do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient. When you have completed the setting of the bone, dip a cloth in a black astringent syrup, especially if it is summer, and do not apply cerates or anything containing fat to the wound.
lest putrefaction and corruption occur. Then, apply the splints when you have finished setting the bone, and leave the wound exposed by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors, the size of the wound.
And beware, with all caution, of tightening the wound with the fracture, for many ignorant physicians have done this, causing their patients either death, or gangrene, or tetanus. Let your binding be loose and relaxed, unlike the binding of other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or a large wound, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and he feels disturbing pain in the place, you should not apply splints, but make bandages from firm cloths in the place of the splints, and bind it with them.
If after a day or two you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, remove the cloth that you placed on it with the syrup, then use lint and ointments with which we customarily treat wounds, such as the tetrapharmacon and the like; and you should loosen the bandage.
And examine the wound every day, evening and morning, until it heals and is cured.  It is necessary that you position the limb so that the pus flows downwards easily. If many days pass and the wound does not close, nor does the pus cease, then know that there are small bone splinters.
Then you should probe the wound; whatever of those splinters is loose, extract and remove it; and whatever is not loose, and is piercing the limb and causing pain, work at cutting and extracting it in every way you can.
If the wound suffers from inflammation, or gangrene, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then you should treat each symptom with its corresponding treatment, as described previously in its chapter.
And what you should pay attention to and keep in mind, if a large bone is broken and protrudes from a limb, such as the femur or humerus and similar large limbs, do not attempt to pull it or remove it. For death often results from this; rather, leave it until it putrefies, for perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
In the treatment of complications which occur after some fractures.
This complication often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially one near the joints, and it makes the limb unsightly and may prevent the limb from its natural function.
Look; if the complication is fresh, use medicines that constrict, such as aloes, frankincense, myrrh, cyprus, acacia, and the like. Take some or all of these and mix them with an astringent syrup, or with egg white, or with vinegar.
Apply it to the complication in a bandage and bind it tightly. Leave the bandage in place for many days, then remove it and reapply another until the complication disappears, God willing; or bind a tightly fitting lead plate onto it.
For lead has the property of removing everything that grows in the limbs. If the complication has become hardened and severe, and necessity compels its removal, then incise it from above and cut away the excess growth, or scrape it away with some instrument until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In the treatment of a fracture, if it has been set and the limb afterwards remains thin and not as it was originally.
If a bone fracture has been set and the limb afterwards remains thin and weak, this is due to many causes. One of these is either due to excessive loosening and tightening of the bandages, or to excessive tightening of the bandages so that nourishment cannot reach the limb, or to excessive and repeated rubbing, or to excessive movement at the wrong time, or to a deficiency of blood and weakness in the patient's body.
The treatment of this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body so that his blood increases, and to use the bath and to make him happy and joyful, and so on.  Then, pitch should be applied to the limb to draw much nourishment to it, or it should be repeatedly rubbed with lukewarm water. until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-two.
In the treatment of fractured bones which have healed crookedly and are prevented from functioning properly.
If, after a limb has healed, a crookedness or a projection of the fractured bone, or a complication appears, and the appearance of the limb is thereby disfigured, unless the limb is prevented from its natural function, then one should not accept the opinion of those who claim that the limb should be broken from the head, as many ignorant physicians and bone-setters in our country used to do.
And this action is very reprehensible, leading to great harm, the least of which is disability. But if the crookedness and complication are recent, then it should be bathed with water in which emollient herbs have been cooked, such as mallow leaves and root, and rosemary, and the like.
And it should be bandaged with emollient bandages, like well-made diachylon, or the sap of mallow root should be taken and beaten with chicken fat and lard and bandaged with it, or ripe figs should be taken and pounded with pigeon dung and the like of medicines which are called inhibitors of consolidation.
And sometimes the complication will be resolved by constant gentle rubbing with the hands, and the movement of the limb in every direction at all times should be used.  If the crookedness is old and severe and hardened, and treatment with iron is necessary,
then it should be incised above and the connection of the bone released, and what remains of the complication or bone should be cut with delicate cuts, and gentleness should be used with effort and care, then the wound should be treated as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
Dislocation of the jaw is the displacement of one of the joints from its place, hindering movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing the patient severe pain and suffering.  If it happens to someone, he should immediately attempt to reduce it.
He should not delay at all, for if he delays, the place will swell and make the reduction of the jaw difficult. Therefore, he should not delay, nor move, nor stretch it while it is swollen, because it often causes the patient spasms and harmful pains.
But if that happens, he should immediately bleed the patient, then leave him until the swelling subsides somewhat, then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reduce it, and treat each limb as mentioned in its place.
The chapters on the jaw are also arranged, as with fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of the lower jaw.
Rarely do both jaws become dislocated, and their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced, relaxing a little, or they are completely dislocated so that they relax. towards the chest, so that the saliva of the patient flows and he cannot retain it, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stutters in speech.  But if the dislocation is slight, in most cases it returns of its own accord very easily.
But if the dislocation is complete, it is necessary to hasten its reduction quickly and not delay it at all.  This is done by having an attendant hold the patient's head, while the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the mouth if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
Or he inserts both thumbs if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and the rest of his fingers from the outside to level it, and he orders the patient to relax his jaw and release it to go to every side, and the physician levels the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then use fomentations with hot water and oil until their reduction is facilitated, and do not delay their reduction at all, as we said.  When they have returned and become level, and the patient's mouth closes and they do not relax, then apply to them pledgets of cloth with a cataplasm made of wax, oil, and rosewater.
Then bind it gently with a loose bandage, and let the patient sleep on his back with his head elevated between two pillows, lest he move it to the right or left, and let him not strain to chew anything, but let his food be soft gruel.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is set, then let him eat whatever he desires, and let him use it gently and not strain to open his mouth when eating, drinking, and yawning until the jaw is set and healed.
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult, if they become dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, then fevers and persistent headaches often result from this, and perhaps the patient's abdomen will become distended, and perhaps he will vomit pure bile. If you see this, then know that it is corrupted.
And many die from this condition within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On the reduction of the clavicle and the tip of the shoulder.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inner side because of its connection to the chest; it may dislocate outwards, and this is evident to the touch.  Its reduction is that the patient should lie on his back and extend his arms.
Then press the area with your hand strongly, and it will return. Then apply a bandage and supports and tighten them. As for its end which is next to the shoulder and connected to it, it does not dislocate except rarely; if it dislocates, then it should be reduced and straightened as we have mentioned and as is possible for you.
Then apply a bandage, supports, and tightening, and instruct the patient to observe rest and stillness until he is healed. With this same treatment, the tip of the shoulder is reduced if it also leaves its place.
Chapter Twenty-six.
In the reduction of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one is that it dislocates towards the armpit downwards; the second is that it dislocates towards the chest; and it may dislocate above the shoulder, and this is rare.
It does not dislocate to the rear because of the shoulder blade, nor does it dislocate to the front because of the nerve.  Most often it dislocates and goes downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, because it goes out quickly in them and goes in quickly.
But as for those whose flesh is abundant, it is otherwise, that is to say, it goes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty.  And it may happen to some people that from a blow or a fall, the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, so that they think it has dislocated. It is necessary to examine this until you are certain of its truth.
Then you proceed to its treatment.  The dislocation is recognized if it is downwards towards the armpit: if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the sound shoulder, you will find a clear difference between them, and you will find the head of the shoulder twisted, and under the armpit, on touching, the head of the shoulder like an egg.
And the patient is not able to raise his hand to his ear, nor to move it in all movements.  Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will find that apparent to the touch, not hidden.
And this dislocation is easily reduced if it is recent or if the patient is a child.  Its reduction is that a servant raises his hand upwards, then you place the thumbs of your hands under his armpit and raise the joint strongly upwards to its place, and the servant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Then he lowers it downwards, and it returns quickly. If it does not return by what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been for many days, then the patient should bathe in hot water and use things which relax and soften, such as cooking marshmallow root, fenugreek, and rosemary in water and using it.
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool which is moderate between softness and firmness. Then the physician places his heel on the ball and grasps the patient's hand with his hand and extends it downwards.
And he pushes the ball with his foot, and it returns to its place. And if you wish, reduce it in this way: you bring a taller man than the patient and position him at the side, and he puts his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raises his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. And another servant pulls the patient's hand downwards towards his abdomen. If the patient is light, then something else should be hung on him to weigh him down, and the jaw will return immediately. And it may also be reduced in another way.
And that is to fix in the ground a long piece of wood, the head of which is round in shape like the pestle of a mortar, neither thick nor thin, then it is placed under the patient's armpit, after placing a soft cloth on the head of the wood, and the patient standing along the length of the wood.
Then you extend his hand downwards from the other side, and you extend his body also from the other side forcefully, and the joint returns to its place quickly. If it is difficult to reduce it by all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment: you take a piece of wood about two cubits long. And its width is about four fingers, and its thickness about two fingers; it has a round head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the armpit, in this manner:
Then you tie a soft cloth on the round head so that the wood does not hurt the patient; then it is placed under the armpit, and the whole hand and arm are extended on the wood downwards, and the wood is tied to the arm, forearm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a crossbeam, level with the width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side; then the joint enters immediately. When it has entered in any way possible, a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared bandage of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is applied to the whole shoulder as it goes around from above; then the ball is tightly tied under the armpit, and the bandage is wound from above, and his hand is suspended from his neck.
He is left without moving his hand for seven days, and the patient's food should be light so that the limb may be strengthened, for this is quicker for its healing. Then, after seven or five days, it is untied and exercised; if it is firm and does not relax, then it is healed.
If the joint dislocates frequently due to moisture or some other cause, cauterization with three cautery irons should be used as described in the chapter on cauterization. If all this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days and the joint is not stable,
the bandage and tightening are repeated several times and it does not stabilize, and it falls and relaxes, and he cannot raise it upwards, then know that the nerve in the head of the humerus is severed, stretched, or relaxed; then know that the joint will never stabilize in its place.
As for a dislocation that is towards the chest and breast and backwards, its reduction is by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns.  The rest of the bandaging and treatment are used until it heals. If, after healing, there is stiffness in the limb and slowness of movement,
the patient should use the bath repeatedly until that stiffness softens and returns to its former nature.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty also. It dislocates in all directions, especially forwards or backwards.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is visible and palpable, whichever way it is dislocated.
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one, that will be clearly apparent to you by the depression of the joint. He cannot bend his arm nor touch his shoulder with it. And you should hasten to reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot swelling occurs.
For if a hot swelling occurs, reduction is difficult, and perhaps it will never heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backwards; for this is the worst of all types of dislocation, the most painful, and often death ensues.
And its reduction, if it is of a kind that can be reduced, is that an attendant extends his hand with both his hands and his arm extended, and the physician's hands above and below the elbow, and he pushes the joint with the thumbs of both hands, or with the base of his palms, until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is forward, it may be reduced by bending the arm sharply until the base of the hand strikes the corresponding shoulder. If the dislocation does not return, use very strong traction; that is, let two attendants extend the arm.
And let two attendants also hold the patient so that he does not move during traction. Then the arm is rotated in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or a wide bandage around his hand. And when the physician touches the joint with his hands, let him lubricate them with oil so that it will be easier to dislocate the joint.
Then he pushes the joint forcefully until it returns. After its return, a bandage containing astringents and desiccant, along with egg white, should be applied tightly and the arm suspended from the patient's neck and left for several days.
Then it is untied. If the joint is firm in its place, untie the bandage and leave it. But if you see that the joint is not yet firm, reapply the bandage and leave it for several days until it becomes firm, then untie it. If swelling occurs after the reduction and untying of the joint…
and there is difficulty in movement, let him use fomentation in the bath and gentle massage and manipulation until it softens, or place a poultice of fat lamb on the joint, then bandage it and leave it on for a day and a night, then remove it and put him in the bath.  When he sweats, massage the joint moderately.
Then reapply the poultice once, twice, and three times with the bath until it softens. And if you wish to apply a moist, light poultice of cow dung with butter and bind it on, do that several times, for it will soften and return to its former state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist often dislocates, and its reduction is easier than that of other joints, except that it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the time it dislocates, before the place becomes swollen or a hot swelling appears.
Its reduction is to place the patient's wrist on a board and have an attendant extend his hand, and the physician places his hand on the prominence of the joint and pushes it until it returns. However, it is necessary to see if the dislocation has gone towards the palm of the hand.
Then let the patient place the back of his hand on the board during extension and reduction.  And if the dislocation is prominent towards the back of the hand, then let the palm of his hand be placed on the board so that the physician's hand falls on the prominence of the joint itself. If it returns immediately, otherwise, bind it with a bandage that calms the swelling.
And leave it; do not manipulate it again, for it does not tolerate it, and you will not be able to reduce it after a few days have passed, except that the joint remains crooked and does not harm the patient in any way, unless the hand becomes weak and unable to grasp anything.
Then you know that the nerve is severed or bruised; there is no remedy for it except cauterization, which may or may not help. When the reduction of the wrist is complete, apply the bandage we described, then tighten it and leave it for five days.
Then it is untied, and the hand is exercised. If its movement is difficult, and something like stiffness appears in it, soften it with warm water and rub it repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
In the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may be dislocated in any direction. If a finger is dislocated towards the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns. Then, bandage the fingertip and suspend it towards the direction in which it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it is straight that day. If it is at night, bandage it in the same way; continue to unbandage it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bandage it at night.  Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; bandage it towards that same direction and do as you did before until it heals.  Do likewise if it is dislocated in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the dorsal vertebrae.
If a vertebra of the dorsal or cervical spine is completely dislocated, or if many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment, for death swiftly overtakes the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's stool passes involuntarily; he cannot retain it, and often some of his limbs, whether his legs or arms or one of them, become relaxed. But if only one vertebra is displaced, it often returns to its place.
And its displacement occurs in four directions. That which is displaced backwards is called a hump. As for its treatment, you should observe: if the hump has occurred from infancy, there is no treatment for it, and there is no cure at all. But that which has occurred from a fall or blow, and the like...
The ancients mentioned it with various treatments in lengthy descriptions, most of which are not useful. I have shortened this, so that a little suffices instead of much of what they have described, by my approximation to the meaning and my explanation of it, and I have depicted the instrument differently from what they explained and described.
I say that the hump which occurs in the front of the chest is incurable, and so is that which occurs to the sides as well.  Only that which occurs in the back is treatable, in the way I describe. This is that you extend the patient on his face.
on a level bench near a wall, and spread a damp cloth beneath him so that his chest is not hurt. Then place an upright plank, fixed in a hole in the ground at one end of the bench towards his head, and another plank towards his feet at the other end of the bench.
And a servant holds the plank – and let it not be firmly fixed in the hole – and another servant holds the other in that manner. Then wrap around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft, tight bandage, and extend the end of the bandage to the plank at his head and tie it there.
Then tighten with another bandage above his hips, above his knees, and at his ankles. Then gather all the bandages and tie them to the other plank at his feet. Then each servant pulls his plank with the bandage, and the planks do not move from their fixed positions.
except that they are not fixed, as we said. And the physician places his hands on the hump with force until it returns, or he places a board on it, then leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits.
and dig in the wall, which we said should be near the patient, a place into which the end of the board fits. Then place the middle of the board on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls strongly until he presses the hump.
and it returns to its place. And if you wish to make it with a hand-turned screw, it is that you fix in the ground at the head of the patient at the end of the shop two planks whose length is a cubit, and at his feet at the end of the shop also two planks.
Let the distance between each plank be a span. And a hole is made in each plank through which the screw passes. And all the wood is firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all. And insert a round rod, which is the screw in which the bandage is twisted, into the holes of the two planks.
And at its end is a hole in which a rod a span long is fixed with what is twisted, and in the other two planks likewise. Then tighten the bandage which you have tightened on the chest of the patient in the screw which is at his head, and the bandages which you have tightened on his legs in the screw which is at his feet.
Then a servant stands at each screw, turning his hand with the wrench with which he twists the screw, and the physician straightens the hump as we have explained. And this is an image of the screw, the shop, and the patient:
Then, after the vertebra returns and the place is straightened, it is necessary to apply a drying compress with egg white, then lint, then place on top of the compress a splint of a plank whose width is three fingers or thereabouts, and whose length is as much as takes the place of the hump.
And on some sound beads, then it is bound with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he recovers. If some swelling remains in the place at the end of healing, then it is necessary to use medications that relax and soften, along with the use of the plank which we described for a long time.
A lead plate may be used in this, and a swelling may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation, and it is an extra bone which has grown; do not treat it with this treatment, for perhaps death will result.
Chapter thirty-one.
In the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and are not subject to what happens to the other joints of slight displacement and depression, and the hip joint is dislocated in four ways.
That is to say, it is dislocated inwards, outwards, forwards and backwards, and it is most often dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards, and the sign of its dislocation inwards is that if you compare the sound leg of the patient with the affected one, it will be longer.
And the knee will be more prominent than the sound one, and the patient will not be able to bend his leg at the groin, and the place next to the groin will be clearly swollen because the head of the femur has gone there.
And the sign of that which is dislocated outwards is that its symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms, and the sign of that which is dislocated forwards is that he extends his leg completely, except that he cannot bend it without pain being in the knee, and if he tries to walk he cannot do so forwards.
And he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when walking he puts his weight on his heel, and the sign of that which is dislocated backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
And the groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly in the position of the loin, and as for the reduction of the types of this dislocation, you should look, for if the dislocation is old, it has become chronic with its owner, and he has not attempted to reduce it and it remains in its state, then there is absolutely no treatment.
Then you should not attempt it, and as for he whose dislocation is recent, and whatever type it is from the four types of dislocation, then hasten to twist the joint and stretch it inwards and outwards and move it to the right and left, perhaps...
it returned and did not need any other treatment, and if it does not return in this way, then you should prepare a strong, helpful servant who will stretch his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied around his leg above the knee, and another servant who will stretch him from above.
by placing his hands under his armpits, then tightening with a soft bandage on the root of the thigh, and a third servant holding the end of the bandage, and his stretching is either from the front from the groin towards the clavicle, or from behind towards the back.
And their stretching is all at once until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains suspended, for this type of stretching is a common type for the four types, and if the dislocation returns as we said, otherwise, each type needs what I mention of specific treatment.
As for its specific reduction, if the dislocation is inwards, then the patient should lie on his sound side, then a bandage is applied to the root of the thigh between the head of the thigh and the place under the groin.
Then the bandage is stretched upwards from the groin to the upper body towards the clavicle, then another strong, helpful servant takes with his arms and embraces the thick part of the affected thigh and pulls outwards with a strong pull, then it returns to its place.
And this type is easier than all the types of treatment by which this member is reduced, and if it is difficult for you and it does not respond to entering with this type of treatment at all, then it is necessary to bind the patient's legs together with a strong, soft bandage on the heels and on the knees.
And the distance between each one and its neighbour is four fingers, and the affected leg is extended more than the other by two fingers, then the patient is suspended by the head from a wooden beam which is in the house, and his distance from the ground is two cubits.
Then you order a strong boy to embrace the head of the thigh, and another boy hangs onto the patient, and the other boy embracing the thigh pushes forcefully, then the joint returns to its place quickly. As for its specific reduction if the dislocation is outwards.
Then the patient should lie down on the bench according to what we described in the case of the hunchback, and the bandage is tightened on his affected leg in particular and on his chest, then the two wooden pieces are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head, then an additional wooden piece is placed in the middle of the bench, very firmly secured.
A wet cloth has been wrapped around it so that it does not harm the patient, so that the wooden piece is between his thighs so that he does not be pulled downwards when he is stretched, then each servant pulls to his side and the physician adjusts the hip with his hands, and if it responds to reduction.
Otherwise, place the board on him and compress it as we mentioned in the case of the hunchback, except that the patient should lie on his sound side, and if the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg should be extended once while he is in this same position on the bench.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected hip, then presses it with the other hand, and with that he makes the pressure extended downwards towards the knee, and if the dislocation is backwards, then the patient should not be extended downwards.
And it is raised above the ground, but rather it should be placed on something solid, just as it should also be from the dislocation of his hip outwards, according to what we mentioned of his lying on the bench and he is on his face and the bandages are tight.
As we said before, and the compression with the board should also be used on the place to which the joint has gone out, so when the hip joint has returned completely as it should, and the sign of its return will not be hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's legs.
Then if you see them even, and the patient contracts and extends the leg without difficulty, then know that the limb has returned as it should, then at that time join the thighs and apply the bandage and tighten it with a turban so tightly that the hip does not move in any direction.
And the patient must remain still for three or four days, then untie the bandage and compare the leg with the other; if you see them equal in size, then know that the reduction is firm, so release the patient to walk, and if you see in it something of relaxation.
Then return and bandage it and tighten it according to your first tightening, and leave it also for three days, then untie it, and let him walk slowly on it for days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter thirty-two.
In the treatment of the reduction of the knee.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inwards, outwards, and downwards, I mean backwards, and it does not dislocate forwards at all. And the sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to bring his leg to his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. And the reduction of all types of its dislocation is that you seat the patient sitting, and he extends his legs if he is able to do that, and a servant sits behind him to hold his waist and twist him slightly backwards, then you sit on his thighs.
And you place your back against his face and place his leg between your legs, then you grasp his knee with your hands and interlock them between your fingers on his knee, then you press with your hands on the sides of his knee forcefully, and another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh softly without constraint. Then bandage it and adhere the leg to the thigh, then bind them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release them. And he should only use a little walking for days until it strengthens.
If it is difficult for you to return it by what we described, then use strong traction with the bandages that I previously described in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel may be slightly dislocated, or it may be completely dislocated.  Its dislocation is either inwards or outwards, and the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and prominent towards the direction in which it dislocated.
As for the treatment of its slight dislocation, it is easy to return it; this is done by gently pulling with the hands and straightening it until it returns. As for its treatment if it is completely dislocated, then the patient should sit, and a strong servant should hold him from behind his back at his waist.
Then you grasp his foot with your right hand from above, and with your left hand from below the foot at the point of the heel. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with the left twice, then straighten it with the left hand and push the front of the foot with the right hand towards the leg without force.
Do this twice as we described, then push the front of the foot towards the leg on the third attempt while you pull at the heel. If it returns in one or two attempts in this manner and you see the foot is straight, then it is done. Otherwise, repeat the procedure, for it will return.
If it refuses to return by what we have described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground and firmly fix a wedge in the ground so that it lies between his thighs, having wrapped a cloth around it so as not to hurt the patient. Then a servant should hold his thigh.
Then another servant stretches the leg, either with his hands or with a rope tied around the leg's neck. Then each servant stretches in the opposite direction to his companion, with the wedge remaining between the patient's thighs to hold him so that his body does not shift downwards during the stretching. Then the physician straightens the dislocation with his hands.
And another servant holds the healthy leg below, for the dislocation will return quickly.  When the dislocation has returned and you are sure of its correct return, apply the bandage and splint, and tighten it with firm bandages, and bind the foot to the splint below.  You should protect the nerve which is above the heel from behind.
Lest the bandage be too tight and hurt him. Then leave it for two or three days; if the bandage loosens, tighten it, then release it on the third or fourth day. And the patient should abstain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this time, you cannot be certain that the dislocation will not recur and be spoiled, and will not then accept treatment. If a hot inflammation occurs, then you should use what we previously described in another place concerning treatment and purification to alleviate it until it disappears.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of dislocations of the toes.
You should set what is dislocated with a slight extension without force; this is not difficult, but easy. If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the instep, then the patient should place his foot on a level surface of the ground.
Or on a board while he is standing as if walking, then you stand and place your foot on the dislocated joint, and then press down on it firmly with your foot until it returns and you see that it is straight and no protrusion appears in the place.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that takes the whole foot, having two ends, then bind it tightly and firmly for three days, then unbind it and keep him from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are safe from recurrence, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation which occurs with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When something like that happens and you attempt its treatment and setting, it often results in death.
Therefore, no one should undertake the treatment of such a thing except one who is skillful in the craft, experienced, gentle, compassionate, deliberate, not reckless or rash, and that he use in the beginning only those medicines which calm hot swellings, and leave the patient alone.
By God’s power, except for what I hoped would be safe from harm, with the mildness of the disease and you saw in it some hope, then return it from its place at the first, before the hot swelling occurs.
If the limb returns to what you intended, then use the treatment which calms hot swellings and treat the wound with whatever is suitable for it from drying ointments; if the dislocation is with a fracture and there are loose fragments in the bone, then remove them. And follow in that what we mentioned in the simple diseases, what preceded in their places.
And strive your best and avoid entering the path of risk, as I have previously advised you; that is more lasting for your reputation and safer for your standing, God willing.
