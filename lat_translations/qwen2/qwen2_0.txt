Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After having provided you with the book, O Son, which is the final part of the science in medicine including its complement and following completion of it, according to its exposition and my own explanations, I find it necessary for me to provide it all to you together with this Treatise which is a part of operations that is surgery with practice.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the operation with hands is located in our region and time, and has been completely neglected for a while until perhaps knowledge of it disappears and its investigation ceases, leaving behind only fragmentary descriptions from ancient books altered by human intervention, resulting in error and hesitation until their intentions are fully formed and their force elongated. I find it necessary to revive it using the structure of this Treatise, according to exposition, declaration, and abbreviation. And to be familiar with the forms of Cauterius's tools and other equipment of the operation; an addition comes from declaration and the need that arises from its investigation.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason for why a skilled practitioner of surgery using his own hands is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and one needs to engage in the author's training before that in the science of anatomy as narrated by Galen, until he understands the functions of members, their forms, their union and separation, and has knowledge about bones, nerves, vessels, their numbers, their egresses, and pulsating veins and quiet veins, and the places where they exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of this, Hippocrates said that the name with a name is much and with work little, and especially in the art of hands.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For one who does not understand what we have said about anatomy will inevitably fall into error when practicing medicine, just like I have seen many of those who are being trained in this science, boasting about it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened was that I saw a physician neglect an indurated lump on the neck of a woman and pierce some arteries in her neck. Consequently, blood flowed from the woman until she died between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician who thought to extract a stone from the urinary passage of an old man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore went to him and extracted it along with part of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	As a result, the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And indeed I had already been called upon to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who was treating a claimant to land in our realm due to his medical skills: and it happened that there was a black eunuch who was with him, having suffered a break near the ankle, close to the heel. And when this doctor acted with his ignorance, he bound up the fracture over the wound with lint balls and pins, using a tight binding, without allowing the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then, according to his wishes, he discharged him.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Later, he discharged him after a few days and warned him not to untie the bandage. He stood like that until his leg and foot developed an indurated lump. Eventually, this led to his downfall.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called to him and approached to untie the bandage; peace followed, and he was relieved of his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, corruption had already set in within the limb, and I could not arrest it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So then the corruption began to roam through the body until its death.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another surgeon who had pierced a cancerous pustule: and it became inflamed for days until the severity of its mischief withstood its master.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	Which is why, when there is a pure cancer originating from a melancholic humour, then it should not be reached with the iron at all, unless it's located in a limb capable of bearing it, in which case the whole thing needs to be removed.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of this, you children need to know that an operation with the hand is divided into two parts: namely, one which associates with health, and one which involves danger in various dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already highlighted throughout this book where an operation is used that involves fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore, you must be careful about this and abandon it: so that the foolish do not find a way to speak and become disgraced.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	So receive this advice with concern and protection, and treat your sick patients with ease and strength, and use the better way that leads to salvation and a commendable succession: and remove terrible illnesses difficult to heal. And free yourself from what makes you afraid, so that doubt does not enter into your faith and welfare when it comes to you.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	Indeed, staying true is more glorious for you, and it is higher among the things in this world, and finally it pertains to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galen had indeed said this in some of his own instructions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not heal the bad sickness: do not call yourself the healer of evil.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now we have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Regarding cautery with fire, and cautery with sharp medicine, a chapter and arrangement from head to feet, and the shapes of instruments and tools of the cautery: and everything necessary for an operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Regarding the division and puncturing, phlebotomy and ventosis, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things: and everything is chaptered and organized according to the forms of the instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Regarding the restoration, dislocation, and treatment of twists, and similar issues: chaptered, organized from head to feet, according to the forms of the instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.

Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Regarding the benefit and harm of cautery: to which compositions it is suitable, at what time: whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Head I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before recalling the operations with it, it must be said what qualities of benefits and harms it has, and in which composition they appear.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I therefore say that the discussion about the quality of benefits and harms from cautery is a lengthy and subtle topic, requiring knowledge and secrets hidden within.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And there have been many wise men speaking on this topic, disagreeing amongst themselves. I find it sufficient to share only a little from their words, fearing that it might become lengthy.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I therefore say that the cautery applies universally to all compositions, whether they are with matter or without matter. Two exceptions though; a hot composition without matter, and a dry composition without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In the composition however, when heat and dryness disagreed with the matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some have said that the cautery is beneficial in such cases.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of that, namely, that a cautery is not suitable in dryness which comes from heat and dryness: for the nature of fire is heat, and it would be incompatible to heal from the warmth and dryness with the warmth and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of that one said: That through the cautery an improvement is made in all dryness and warmth which happens in human bodies: for when you compare the body of a man with its moisture to the composition of fire, you find the body of a man to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And indeed I say this through his words: for that has been shown to me by experience on several occasions.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, one should not apply it unless they have already been proven and practiced in the chapter of the Cautery exercise at the end, and have understood the diversity of human compositions, the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, as well as the circumstances surrounding them, and the duration of these.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	With respect to other compositions, there is no fear for you: particularly in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	Indeed, all doctors have now agreed on them: and they did not disagree about improvement with the cautery in these.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know sons, that from the secret of healing through the cautery with fire, and its advantage over the cautery with burning medicine is as follows: for fire is simple, whose action does not reach unless to the member being cauterized: and it does not harm another member joined to it, unless in a minor injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The medicinal action when applied causes an extension from the limbs, and perhaps it may result in causing difficulty of healing within the member, or perhaps it could be lethal.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	However, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, fire does not do this unless there is an excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now indeed, through experience, we have come to understand this, because of the length and dedication to study alongside expertise, and position over truth in matters, and for that reason the excuse from the length of discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if there were no such thing, because this is not allowed to my book, I would reveal to you a secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation within its bodily emissions, through which it expels diseases using a demonstrative philosophical discourse that would awaken your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And children, you should know that they disagree during the time when a cautery should be applied and prefer better times for truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that a cautery is suitable at any time: therefore, the harmful effects due to time are submerged in the benefit that is drawn out with the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if a cautery is for pain due to necessary, strong, sudden pains that do not tolerate delay; therefore, one fears the occurrence of a mischief which is greater than the small harm caused by delay out of time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let this thought fall into your minds, children, that they do not understand, unless it is the common and foolish doctors, namely that they do not think that every disease cured by a cautery always has a return: and they propose these consequences, and it is not as they imagine: therefore, a cautery is not instead of medicine, which alters complexion, and removes moisture which causes pain.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, the cautery is useful compared to medicine because of the speed of his health and the strength of his operation, and the intensity of his domain: and it is possible that he recovers from sickness for an hour or so according to the constitution of the weak one, and the location of his sickness, and the strength of him: and what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluities in it: and what comes to him in acquisition through food, and similar things from causes, unless there is sickness when the cautery administration takes place.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Subtle illness in a limb from few superfluities and moisture, like the cautery on teeth due to pain, is possible. For indeed, that pain may not recover in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the term refers again to the fact that cautery is the last resort of medicine, which is a correct statement: not towards what they aim for in it; because they believe there is no cure that comes with medicine or after the application of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	However, this is contrary to that notion and its purpose; that cautery is the last resort of medicine isn't true unless when we have tried various methods for curing illnesses and they don't yield results with medications. Then we apply cautery at the end of all procedures, which does produce results then. Thus it follows that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to how the common people and many doctors understand it.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	Ancient people said that the cautery made with gold is better than one made with iron. They did not say this merely because of the equality of gold and the quality of its substance but they also stated that it does not produce pus in the area where the cautery is applied.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But this is not absolutely true: for I have already tested that thing, and found that it does not cause that effect in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you heat the cautery in fire made from gold, it does not become evident to you, when heated according to how much you wish, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches to a cold state, and if you add fire upon it, it melts in the fire and transforms into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls into occupation from this: and because of this, we have a cautery with iron that is faster and closer, in terms of direction towards action.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And indeed, I have already arranged this chapter on the cautery according to chapters, and organized it from head to feet so that anyone seeking can find what they want.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Section: On the method of applying the cautery, Chapter on coronal incision.
Caput II.	Title II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cautery treatment relates to the influence of humidity and coldness on the brain: these two are the causes of sweating, and the multitude of bodily fluids flowing from the head to the eyes and ears, and the multitude of dreams, toothaches, and throat pain: universally, all illnesses that occur due to coldness, such as paralysis, sweats, epilepsy, and similar illnesses resulting from sickness.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cautery application is to prescribe this treatment to the sick: so that it begins with cleansing medicine for the head on three or four nights, depending on what the strength of the patient requires, and their age, and their habits.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head along with the beard.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then have him sit between your hands in a square formation, so that his hands are already on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the base of your palm over the base of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	And wherever your middle finger goes, mark that spot with an indelible sign.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply oil from the cautery: this is how it should be done.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place him over the marked spot with an indelible mark, applying pressure gradually with your hand and you rotate him.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly raise your hand, and you will see the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that the amount of alkali has leaked out from the bone through the mouth or the quantity of herb, then raise your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, apply your hand with the iron, or use another that has been cooled beforehand: until you see the bones I told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, then soak the affected area, and place it on the spot; and release him for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the butter-soaked affected area on him, and release him to the spot until the blistering scar is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with the fourfold ointment until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the longer the wound remains open, the more pus it discharges; therefore, it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them say that the skin should be burned down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until something of thickness begins to burn.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it is cut after that which has been made smooth from bone, and then it is treated.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to arrive at the end with the cauterizer until a mark of a tooth impression appears, so that the mouth falls as if it were shaped like a kirate: or an instrument that women place immersed in the shape of a small letter 'a': and they think that the head vapors escape from this spot, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated until the healing process is completed.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, these two kinds of cauterization do not seem entirely distinct unless in certain individuals according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to release it myself, for me is better with regard to his health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head weakens through dissolution of its natural continuity: as we have testified with other limbs; and especially when the head itself is naturally weak: and indeed the first kind of cauterization seems more beneficial and better to me, and I use it: so that therefore I act with it for health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Section 13: On the method of cauterizing the head in total headache.
Caput III.	Head III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic headache affects the entire head: and this lasts in the sick person, and they use heat treatments, warm baths, head washes, oils, and massage.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cauterization, as we have described, and nothing from that is effective for him; then consider the situation.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is strong by nature of its creation and is not weak, and finds cold relief: then cauterize with another cauterization under that to some extent.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then, after that, apply a cautery to his head on all of its horns, so that the skin does not tear through and the quantity accessible from bone is uncovered as we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	Then apply the cautery to him on his head exactly at the point named 'uas': this is the place where a windpipe is placed: lift your tool here and do not uncover the mouth.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	Indeed, he has found this because of the severe pain and something different from the pain caused by other more extensive head surgeries.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say that this is the Cautery at its place: and it should be a cautery with which horns of the head are treated, and the back part (occiput) needs to be done more carefully with a finer cautery, where the middle part of the head gets cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Regarding the method of applying cauterization on one half of the head, whether with heated medicine or metal.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and heat occur in part of the head or extends to the eye, and the head is treated with purifying medicines, and then other treatments are administered as described in the divisions of illnesses. This does not encompass it completely: in such a situation, cauterization is performed in two ways: either by applying cauterization with an acute burning medicine, or using iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cauterization with an acute burning medicine involves taking one tooth or another, and removing the rest of it, cutting off its extremities from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Next, divide the pain site while being accompanied by a broad bloodletter until you create a spot beneath the skin where the tooth will be extracted.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore, insert him under the skin until it is hidden; then bind him with a binding suitable for an ointment, and remove him after fifteen hours, then let him off for two or three days. Afterwards, place a clove submerged in butter over him until pus forms at the site: thereafter treat him with ointment until he has fully recovered.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if someone performs this (procedure) with certain physicians who burn, as I wrote in my twelfth treatise, about those who are burnt medicinally.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	But the cauterization with iron is according to this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Fire cautery, whose form is thus.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called the Key: because its head's form resembles that of a key, where there is some curvature, and in the middle of it, there is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the spot and hold your hand: and you should gradually move the iron with speed. And let the amount of what is burned be according to the thickness of the skin, as half of its width.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and there is a flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the cauterized area in salt water, and place it over the spot, and let it heal for three days. Then apply it with butter: afterwards take care with ointment until it is fully healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, perform this hemi-cranial cauterization with the second surgical tool of cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And be cautious about making an incision near the artery in this hemi-cranial area, not too close to its original position.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	¶ Concerning the manner of cauterization in an old hemi-cranial region.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a hemi-cranial area, follow the treatment procedures we have discussed previously and those concerning divisions of illnesses; if the treatment does not suffice, observe the illness to determine that what was said about the first cautery with medicine or fire is insufficient. Then it's necessary to use the surgical tool of cautery until the area becomes white after signs of pain with a line on it whose length is half a finger, or similar to this description. Hold your hand one way only and press it until you reach an artery and proceed until you arrive at its source.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, you must beware of the continuity of the jaw bone which moves during chewing, so as not to burn the side or the nerve that moves it, thereby causing cramps.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be mindful of the care and caution regarding the flow of blood in the artery that has been severed.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	Indeed, the risk is high during amputation, especially for those who do not understand what they are doing and are neither diligent nor experienced. It would be best to avoid performing such an operation with someone like that at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I take caution when remembering the situation of blood flow accidents due to severing an artery according to its manner and place, within this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see due to illness that it does not suffice him this cautery, and if you see an infirm body enduring the cautery in the middle of its head, as we narrated, take care of the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you see fit, administer the cautery, which we spoke about in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery that has two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	Indeed, this type of cautery is better and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	### On the method of applying cautery in ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When ear pain occurs due to cold, and it is treated with oils that are rubbed into the area, along with the other treatment we discussed for dividing (ear) issues, but if the pain does not subside, then apply fire cautery: this is what is called a 'Punctum', whose form is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Next, after igniting the 'Punctum', apply it around the entire area of the ear as described, or around both sides if pain is present in both ears.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And lengthen yourself with a cautery from the root of the ear moderately, after you have marked the places with an applicator: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points throughout each ear, and roughly so.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	And then attend to the areas until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	¶ On the method of cauterization by means of torture.
Caput VII.	Head VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The kind of torture that heals with cauterization is only due to the species which happen from putridity, as we said in our divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And the proper cauterization for the species which happens from drying out and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you are treating this species of torture with hot baths and purges, and gargling, if your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient three times: once at the root of the ear, and secondly a little lower than its proper place, and thirdly at the junction of both lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And apply your cautery from the opposite side of the diseased part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Since healing does not occur unless on the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is to apply the cautery with a tool directly at the tip of the upper ear below the horn of the head a little bit: and on another part, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And hold your hand with the cautery until the amount that is half the thickness of the skin burns.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a species from that made by knives, whose form has been mentioned previously: but it should not be less narrow than what you see; and it must have a knife in it with a slight excess of thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the places, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	In the method of cauterization in ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Title VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy hardens, and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment does not suit, and the patient doesn't have a fever, then apply four cauterizations on all parts of his head, and perform a cauterization in the middle of his head as we have said, and do a cauterization at the back of his head according to what has preceded: and the degree of cauterization should be according to what has preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	And even with the cauterization above the stomach's mouth: and this is more extreme.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then it heals, as what has preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	In the method of cauterization in Omission.
Caput IX.	Title IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary to use large doses of ghee (hyerae) at first for the sick person and pills that purify the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the whole head of the sick person and put on the back of his head the plaster described with respect to snail (synapi) as written in the book about plasters, and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	Indeed, that is the measure of cauterization: and do that according to the same order which I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If it is healed by this, then it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If it doesn't heal, then do to him three cauterizations in the posterior part of his head, which descend from the upper part of his head down to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cauterization the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then comes the care of the cautery, with that which precedes it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	And if there is an addition [to the injury], and the sick person can tolerate it: then do to him a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	And if there is an additional [injury]: then apply the cautery over both horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for it until it heals: and apply the cautery with oil according to the manner that was previously described.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	¶ Concerning the method of applying the cautery for paralysis and softening.
Caput X.	Title X.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary for you to proceed with head shaving and with what we have said about it.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the sick person's head: afterwards apply the cautery in the middle of the head, and over all the horns of the head, and over his buttocks, and three times on the neck joints.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	And if you need it for body softening in many ways, and the sick person can tolerate it, and the sickness is strong: then apply the cautery four times over the vertebral joints, and with the last one until a great amount of flesh burns from his skin, and lift up your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for it until it heals: and apply oil to the cautery in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	¶ Concerning the method of applying the cautery in Epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Title XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	Epileptics are not cauterized unless the epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, you must shave his brain first when you bathe him, and with the rest of the treatment we have mentioned in the division: when the sick person is large, or can tolerate the intake of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If it is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then gargling and brain-cleansing mastications are given, before many days with the improvement of foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Next, cut his head, then apply the cautery to him with a single one in the middle of the head, as has been done previously in manner. And use another cautery at the back of his head, and over all the horns of his head, use the cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If the sick is strong and can tolerate it, then apply the cauterization with the ones I said in the case of paralysis, and soften the body over the atlas vertebrae and the dorsal ribs: and let it be oiled with the olive according to the manner that has been done beforehand.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	If however the sick is a child, then place the cautery subtly, according to this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	¶ On the method of applying the cautery in Melancholy.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then apply the cautery with the ones we said in the case of paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excess leading to melancholy and there is a weakened body that is humid, then give him something in his drink that cleanses his brain, according to what was done in division: then cut the sick's head, and afterwards make a neat circular bandage out of linen as you would for a headband.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head: and let the sick person be held square from every side while sitting.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then present the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is more worthy from old bee's wax.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And warm it with a fire tempered by warmth, up to the measure that a finger can endure when it is introduced into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then evacuate him inside his head in the middle of its circle, and release him until he cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Perform this for the sick person once every week, together with their usual treatment until it improves, until they are healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you have an arrow wound, cauterize him by making many small punctures on it; moreover hold your hand with the cautery: indeed let there be a smell of it.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this is how the appearance of the cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then put on him wool that has been soaked in butter or chicken fat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing when the water is descending to the eye.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When you are told the beginning of water in the eye through the signs I mentioned in division, then begin and treat the patient with that which purifies his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep him away from all moisture, and have him bathe for several days while fasting.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then instruct him to shave his head and cauterize himself in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then, when the beginning of water descends in both eyes at the same time or from one eye, cauterize yourself twice with two applications of the cautery. If it's only one eye that has the beginning of water, then perform it from one side. Remove all veins and arteries under the skin during this process. Make sure the cautery marks are long in width compared to the time intervals. Be cautious not to allow any bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you notice anything from it, immediately remove it with whatever medicine is possible: and I pardon using wisdom when extracting arteries and cutting them, as well as being cautious about bleeding.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And sometimes it is cauterized at the neck, between two bones, with two last cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	On the method of cauterization in ancient lacrimal ducts.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old and constant, they are above veins and arteries which are in the manifest head externally. It is verified that this comes from excess of cold, phlegmatic substances: then apply cauterization with the same method as I have described for the descending water, mid-head cauterization, and two cauterizations at intervals, and two cauterizations at the neck between two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if there is need for an additional application, then apply cauterization to the entire side of the eye, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cauterizing tool.

When you treat this condition, following what we have discussed about its division, and if the treatment does not match up: then proceed swiftly and administer infusions of astringent garlic for three nights. Afterwards, shave his head, and apply cauterization using a central cauterizer and an olive oil-based cauterizer.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then apply cauterization with a chisel-shaped cauterizer for two times, above the eyebrows under the hair slightly.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And watch out to avoid the artery, do not hit it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	This is the form of the cauterizer called the Chisel.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	On the method of cauterization for the softening of eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye softens due to illness or moisture, then apply cauterization to the eyelid with a single cauterizer, using a lunar cauterizer.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you need to bleed him, cauterize above the two eyebrows somewhat twice in every part: and let them be extended from each other by two intervals: and make the length of all the cauterizations according to the lengths of the eyebrows: and do not hold your hand with the cauterizer until the third eyelid, but rather according to how much is burned of the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of cauterization according to this way of lunar cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	The method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are turned inward and prick the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	Cauterization is done in two ways: either with an iron heated by fire, or with a cauterizing medicine that burns.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	When using a cauterizing iron, advise the patient beforehand to remove their hairs if there are any that cleanse them, until they extend and align.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If they prick him at his eyelid's edge: then hold his eyes closed with your finger so that they do not move until the cauterization takes effect.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they have begun to heal and align, then place the patient's head on your breast. Next, mark the eyelids with a hot tool, in a pattern resembling a leaf of myrtle: and make the beginning of the mark near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place it treated with egg white on the eye, or apply mucus from psyllium over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Next, use an iron to perform cauterization, which is done in this manner.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then, cauterize over the pattern that you have marked repeatedly in various places, until the skin surface burns as much as a complete leaf of myrtle would cover.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of health for your work is: if you think that the eyelid of the eye has already contracted and hairs have been raised at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore lift your hand then: and let it be for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place on it Clove with butter until the scab is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the ointment until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	And if some hair returns after an hour, and the eyelid softens: then apply the cautery to that place again, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	And if the hairs are at the bottom: then apply the cautery to it until they return to their natural place: and level them so that they do not prick the eye.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	Do it to the sick person until they remove and level the hairs.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make it out of cloth in the shape of a laurel leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap, and from one that has not absorbed water from each separately the weight of an ounce or about this amount. Then grind these together with good grinding, so as not to cool it down.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then from the paste that you have made from this, spread it over the piece of cloth like the shape of a laurel leaf, and place it on the eyelid(s) of one or two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye, a clove that has been immersed in egg white: and let the head of the sick person be in your bosom.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on the medicine and press it somewhat.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you should move yourself as often as you feel the sickness of the bite of medicine, because he has found his bite like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore he perseveres with what he has found to be his bite, then abandon the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the bite has ceased, then remove the medicine and wash your eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider, if you see the eyelid lifting, as it would lift during contraction with fire or incision, it is well: and if not, then repeatedly apply medicine on top of it to the place where the medicine does not stick, and do not disparage until your operation equates and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place on it the cōtum with butter until the dry skin is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Next, treat it with the diaphanic ointment or another one until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And you must guard the last watch when operating, so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after a day, and something from the hair fights in the eye, then repeatedly apply medicine to that place which softens from the eyelid properly, just as you did initially.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And you will know that men's eyes vary in size and thinness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, this is your consideration: do not conceal the straight path for him who has a desire for this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	Section on the method of cauterization in lacrimal fistulas.
Caput XIX.	Head Nineteen.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When treating a Fistula, following what we discussed in the divisions of illnesses, if your treatment does not prove effective: then, it is necessary for you to cauterize it according to this manner.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the patient to lay their head on your chest, and have them hold their own head with one of their hands like this: so that it does not move or jolt when they are moving their head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place the decoction on a wool cloth or psyllium jelly over their eye: then take the cautery, which has this shape.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Lie flat like a parrot's head, with the shape of a pipe made by carving from one end, as is made for a cautery: and if you wish to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to go upwards, try this.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave shape is better for your task.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and remove any pus from it and clean it. And if it is not open, then open it and remove its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place the then on it cautery which is lit very strongly.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand near the cautery with it at the eye and towards the nose part, so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient: then place the cautery on the fatty area of the eye, and consume it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If you have thus reached the beginning of your cautery up to the mouth, that will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then apply the cautery once, or twice if you need it: and let that be done for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place Cottum with butter, and care for it with drying ointment, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If forty days pass and it is not healed: then apply upon it a caustic medicine, until the mouth appears; and shave it according to how it grows in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another mode of cautery for a fistula, as some of the early ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Go to the site of the fistula and close it up: then place into the wound a thin piece of camahan, that is, a thin tube, which has this form.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of an ounce of melted lead, and hold your hand with the camahan in place well, and do not let the invalid move at all, so as not to cause him to sweat or have the molten lead come to his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place on the invalid's eye Cottum (a substance) which has been infused in egg white or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For the lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it with a marvelous cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed as we said from cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer an opening of the nose, and return the fistula to the course of the nose, according to how it will naturally be in its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	### On the method of cautery for wounds in the lips.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Often wounds occur in the lip called "whiskers", and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	So when you treat these wounds, using what we discussed about the division of illnesses, if no healing comes from that, then apply a small cautery iron according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let its curvature be according to the subtlety of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place it burning quickly within the cracks, until the cauterizing reaches the depth of the cracks.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the crust until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	Regarding the method of cauterization in a sinus of the mouth.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of teeth: afterward pus appears and bursts out. Afterwards it heals up again, but pus flows out again and a sinus is formed; then you should treat that one, and not make any treatment stick there, for when this happens, a burning cauterizer according to the amount which will fit into the sinus must be used.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the burning thing into the opening of the sinus, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its deepest point and end. Do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then care for it afterwards, according to what we have said about the treatment until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the cure is complete and it heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the rotten mouth according to what will come out from its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	Regarding the method of cauterization in gums and softened teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum becomes soft due to moisture and teeth become loose, and you treat it with medicines without sticking any treatment there: then place the head of a sick person into your armpit.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then use the cauterizing tool that will take this form afterwards, so you put a cannula on top of the tooth: and insert the burning cauterizer quickly in there: and hold your hand for a while until the sick person feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the teeth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And raise your hand: then apply the cauterizer several times, according to your preference.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the sick person fill their mouth with salty water, and hold it for an hour: and expel it.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the tooth becomes firmly set, and the gums become softened and tightened, and the moisture that has gone bad is dried off.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	In the manner of cauterizing teeth with pain.
Caput XXIII.	Title XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When there is pain in the teeth due to coldness, or if it is already cold within the tooth itself, or due to worms, and no remedy works with medications: then you use the cauterizer on the tooth according to two methods: either a cauterizer mixed with butter: or a cauterizer with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The cauterizer mixed with butter is such that you take the heated butter and apply it to the bulla (blister), in a copper or silver cup.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then hold the point, and cover the tip of the needle with it.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse it in the heated butter: and place it on the painful tooth as quickly as possible, and hold it until the heat subsides: then apply it several times, until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, immerse the wool or the point in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth. And place a heated iron over it until the heat reaches deep into the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cauterization with fire is done by aiming towards an air pipe or iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And there should be some thickness within its body so that the sharpness of the fire does not penetrate to the sick person's mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then apply the fire cauterizing instrument, whose shape will be that of a hook: and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand until the cauterizing instrument cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this repeatedly, for pain is alleviated, or it occurs on the same day, or on another.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And the patient should fill the mouth with the tip of that cauterizing instrument until it reaches his good tooth and hold it for one hour. Then he should spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	This is the form of the cauterizing instrument.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Apply with any extremity according to what is possible: and this is the form of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in strophyles.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When strophyles are caused by phlegm and the cold humors, and do not respond to treatments with simples or speed up their digestion, then apply the fire cauterizing instrument, which has this form.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open ends, so that smoke leaves the cauterizing instrument through one end at the other: and place the ignited one over it once on a blister, and the second time if you need it until it reaches deep into the blister.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the blister is small, then place the cauterizing instrument according to the size of the blisters.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then let it off for three days, and place on it an infusion of butter until what was burned by the fire is relieved.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then care for it with salve on the teeth until the form of the cannula heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in hoarseness and constriction of breathing.
Caput XXV.	Head XXV.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When dampness covers the pulmonary canal and especially when this is associated with a cold constitution, then the sick person must be treated initially using medicines that are well dissolved.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then, cauterize him near the root of his throat at a depressed place: and be careful not to touch with the cauterizing tool either towards the throat or on the skin, unless something of it is required.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize him with a different cauterizing tool at the junction of the neck with the last rib on its end: and let the cauterizing tool be like a key following the manner of the one that precedes it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him with what has preceded until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	§ On the method of cauterization in lung diseases and coughing.
Caput XXVI.	Head XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When the cough and lung irritation are due to cold dampness, and the sick person does not have fever, nor tuberculosis, nor old irritation: then cauterize him with two cauterizations above the throat at depressed areas, gently and completely.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And use another cauterizing tool in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cauterizer be like the one that has preceded, in terms of shape.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you need your cauterization to be puncturing with a cauterizing tool that is called "The Point", whose shape precedes it in the process of ear pain puncturing: and let there be punctures from thirty points up until almost reaching elsewhere.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him with what has preceded until he is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let there be a cauterizer having three branches: according to this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Whereas the cautery is applied together with it, when you perform it in place of one threefold cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	Concerning the method of applying the cautery to the titillico (a surgical instrument), during the dislocation of the shoulder blade.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the assistant is dislocated due to wetness and does not return at its usual time after its dislocation until it has become accustomed to returning, then one must use a small movement to dislocate it as we have already testified that happens, then you should return the dislocation in the first instance.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient is supinated on his back, or on his healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then raise the skin, which is inside the titillico up to your left hand's fingers with your thumb, and if the joint gets dislocated towards the insides.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then, having two real cauteries with fire.
Cuius forma est haec.	And here is the form of that.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then apply the cautery to the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and you will receive the figure of the cautery with four applications.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes a three-fold cautery is used for the cautery procedure which then results in a figure of the cautery with six applications. And there are true forms according to the subtlety of the tool being tested.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of a cautery that has three parts.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	Sometimes an additional method is added to this one, which results in eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place crushed plants with salt on the cautery.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then ensure the patient remains calm so that the limb is not moved at any time until they are reassured.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is towards the upper part, and it happens rarely, then burn him above the shoulder with a triangular cautery or by burning in multiple points.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	And the joint becomes stable, and moisture is removed: and the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	Regarding the method of applying cautery to the Stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and much moisture occur in the Stomach until it is extracted from its composition, and discharges increase towards it, and continuous methods of treatment are not sufficient: then it is necessary that the patient be placed on his back, and spread out his legs, and stretch out his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then apply the treatment with three cauteries: a triangular cautery of the size of a finger under the cochlea of the chest, and a triangular cautery on the clavicle, and two more below from each side of one cautery until the figure of the more advanced cauterization appears.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen between the two so that they do not join when pus is being made.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be equal to twice and a third of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the more advanced cautery be as this pattern without addition: and if you want to apply a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this pattern: and let there be one cautery which does this cautery according to the shape of the circle according to this pattern.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it with that which recoils from this cautery: and it happens like so; signs are placed on top of the stomach's point according to the amount you use with an incense stick: then apply it with a puncture cautery, then treat it with treatment which preceded until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	On the method of cauterizing The outer ear.
Caput XXIX.	Title XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When pain occurs in the Ear due to coldness and moisture, or from strong winds, until it leaves her natural constitution, and the patient is treated as we have said, but does not benefit from that: then it should be covered by the patient on his neck, and three applications of heat are made according to this form, and the same quantity below the outer ear, where the arm reaches, under the chin: and there should be a space between each application equal in width to the thickness of a finger: and make an application according to the length of the body straight: and do not press your hand with the heat for too long.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of what burns be equal to the thickness of the skin, and not more than half: and let the patient stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already extended his legs and lifted up his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of cauterization.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And indeed, it is possible for you to apply these cauterizations with a surgical tool when you possess skill and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard yourself so as not to proceed too far in cauterization, and the thickness of the skin gets burned everywhere, causing the whole body to be burned, and it reaches the intestines: because there is thinness there, you understand that.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the method of cauterizing otorrhoea (discharge from the ear).
Caput XXX.	Title XXX.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When discharge occurs, and you need to know if that pustule is inside the flesh of the ear or within its covering. If it's inside the ear's flesh, the patient will experience pain and heaviness without sharpness: and if it's within the ear's covering, accompanied by pain, there is sudden sharpness: and you can see that his treatment by the doctors has already exhausted him.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, it is necessary that the patient elevate upon his neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Next, create the position of an apostle with wax: then use the cautery tool that resembles a rod.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And when you have this form, use one cautery tool until the entire skin is burned and reaches the siphon until the unhealthy part has completely come out. Then take care of it with healing procedures until it heals completely.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary to use this type of cautery tool, except for those whose expertise in the art of medicine extends: and when such illnesses present themselves with occasional experience: then he may venture upon such operations.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But rather to dismiss it myself, this is better for me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	§ On the method of cauterization for pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that the cautery with roots of Aristolochia should be used for cold pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And you should take one long root from the dry roots of Aristolochia, a longer root which can be found there, and it should resemble the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and then light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then use a single cautery tool on the area between the throat and neck, and apply two smaller co-planar cauteries slightly inclined downwards to the part under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And apply two more cauteries also on the area between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly inclined downwards towards the back. And use another cautery in the middle of the chest, and yet another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three burnings from the back: one where there is between two spoons: and two burnings from both sides of the chest, with the lower burning that is between the two spoons.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it should not happen to compress your hand with the iron, rather there should be a noticeable smell of skin while it is being burnt.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some of the ancients have said that there are people who use a tool similar to a needle made from iron and apply it with fire. They insert it inside where there is space between the ribs, until they reach the pustule with it, and it emerges after healing: as we explained about the pustule in Epatis.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But with this puncture and using the iron, there is fear that either the patient dies immediately or a窦 opens up in the location which does not have healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	§ On the method of cauterization of the Splenum Head - Chapter 32.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are treating splenic discomfort, according to what we have discussed regarding the treatment of diseases and if your treatment does not produce results, then there is a need for a third method of using the iron on it. All these three methods are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of these involves making three or four burns lined up according to the length of the spleen in the shape of the burn as described by Epatis, which precedes this figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between every burn the thickness of a finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And the method of applying heat should be the same as what we have described for the ironing technique in Epatis.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the iron; and have the patient lying down on their back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	Another method for cauterization is as follows: having two genuine burning irons, as we mentioned in the chapter on shoulder dislocation. Lift the skin which is directly over the spleen, where the left arm reaches up to its elbow. And have your lifting motion lift the skin according to the width of the body so that the burns fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two heated needles until you enter the skin from one side; then remove the cautery. Therefore, four cauterizations are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you have to cauterize with another cautery having three needles.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the patient after you remove the cautery, allowing it to emit pus for many days: because it is more intense than all the rest that have preceded from treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	§ On the method of cauterization in Hydropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Title XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall in Hydropsy, except properly.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat Hydropsy with the methods of treatment we discussed in division, and if the treatment does not improve the condition, then it is necessary to cauterize it four times around the umbilicus using a single cautery, once over the stomach, another over the spleen, and one on top of the splenic area. Cauterizations should be performed twice along the back between the vertebrae, and one in the direction of the chest, and another directly over the stomach: and let the depth of each cauterization be about as thick as the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then release the open cautery, so that it discharges pus over an extended period of time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not discharge the sick from treatment after the application of the cautery with it; for there should be two intentions that join him: and the healing will come to him with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	However, the shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be like a key: according to its previous form. And for that one with which the back is cauterized, it should be circular according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	§ On the method of cauterization for Feet and Legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Head XXXIV.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When the urine becomes yellow and fills up in a hydroptic patient, it is necessary that you burn on the back of the foot at a spot known as 'noncratia', which is between the external ear (auricular) and the heel ('anulus'). And raise your hand with the cauterizing tool without twisting it. Then raise your hand again and don't touch the cauterizing instrument entirely.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	Indeed, the yellow water will be there, and perform the cautery according to this manner.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then, on each of the two legs, perform two cauterizations over the entire length of each leg. And carry out the cautery using the edge of the instrument as well. Perform the cautery according to the length of the leg; one under the knee and another below it, roughly midway down the leg. Over every hip joint, make two cauterizations. Release the open cautery without treatment for a long time so that some water might come out from it, then take care of this and the other points we have mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	¶ Method of performing the cautery in the solution of the stomach.
Caput XXXV.	Head XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the stomach solution is due to cold and moisture, until it weakens the retained and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines; then heal this with methods of healing, not letting it fully recover. And you will see a patient tolerating the burn of an excessive virtue. Then, perform the cautery on him using a large cauterizing tool over his stomach as what precedes in the stomach cautery with circular cauterizing tool and four thin cylindrical cauterizations around the umbilicus area, using a small triangular cauterizer beneath them: and then do a larger or two cauterizations above the pubis.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moisture and a patient tolerating this, then perform the cautery over the ribs with a large cauterizer, and do it everywhere. Perhaps you might add two small cauterizations near the stomach for the big one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For indeed, the remedy is efficacious, whose aid never fails.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Title 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the year there are many old hemorrhoids or one, and they are from thick, cold, or damp fluids that have gone bad, and when they are treated as we said in division, and if the treatment does not succeed: then cauterize them with three applications of a cautery to the lower section of the spinal column below the ischium, in an area roughly triangularly shaped on either side. Then apply a cautery under the navel almost as wide as two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is cooled down, and the food he eats is not digested, and you see his face turn pale, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery as previously described: and apply a cautery over the spleen and another one over his appendix using a key-shaped cautery. And leave the open wound to heal at some point in time; afterwards, take care of him until he recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing adenoids after their removal.
Caput XXXVII.	Title 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you remove adenoids, then use the cautery that resembles a radius (or rod).
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the ignited instrument into the removed adenoids: and move your hand until the cautery reaches the vessel from which blood is flowing; do this once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore the adenoids are many, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them using whatever aids from ointments that yield success, until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on the acanthus, it is more effective for recovery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	Title 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not respond to surgery and treatment as we have described in its proper place, and is frightened by it, perhaps healing may occur with cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	So when something like an anal fistula occurs, and it becomes infected, pus flows from it, and decaying moisture is discharged.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore, what needs to be done is to probe it with a delicate instrument.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then determine the depth of its extent using a probing instrument.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Next, apply the cautery which is similar to a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself ignited into the fistula and determine the depth within which it has entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly apply the cautery to it until all decaying substances are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to the extent of your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And protect yourself from the irritation of nerves if they are there or large veins: or if the fistula reaches to the bladder body, or to the intestinal body, then protect yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fatty area: and you think that it is not penetrating deeply.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the wound until it is fully healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If the wound is sealed and the material has been removed from it for a long time: then you will know that it has now healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the material does not come away from it, then you will know that it is penetrating, or its hole is deeply decayed, or as if this comes from there: whose recall will come to its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterization of the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Title XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or from thick winds, and it diminishes because of this ailment affecting the weaker one, then you should cauterize it on the inside on their own kidneys, with a cauterizing tool over all the kidney. The preparation for this must be recalled beforehand.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we might cauterize it again on its own inside.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore, three lines come about.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	So they are more effective in improvement.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterization of the bladder.
Caput XL.	Title XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture, until the sick person no longer retains urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the inside on the bladder, where hairs begin at the genital area, with a tool from the right side and another from the left side. The length of this cauterization should be similar to that of an inch. Cauterize it with a cauterizing tool under the back or with two cauterizations if necessary: and let it follow the cauterization done by the clavus tool beforehand.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterization of the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Title XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When coldness and moisture affect the womb, preventing it from being fertilized, her periods are disturbed, their arrival is delayed, and pain occurs at their approach, then it must be treated with three cauterizations around the belly button, as we explained in the cauterization of the bladder, and a cauterizing tool on the lower abdomen, or two cauterizations: and let this be done using the clavus tool.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing the elbow in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Title XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucus moisture is poured onto the elbow joint, and becomes a cause of its exit from its place; and the sign of this is that when they are compared side by side, the shank extends over the other one. And the location of dislocation is found in it being vacuous.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, you must cauterize the weak part above the elbow joint with a similar circular cauterization: after marking it with an iron around the circumference of the elbow, just as it revolves; and let the ash fall in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And make the shape of the cautery precede in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauterizations, using a large oil-filled cautery. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the entire skin quantity.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the method of cauterization for Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Title XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the elbow joint and it is caused by coldness and moisture: and when the patient recovers with it as we said in division, but there's no improvement and it gets worse again. Then you need to relieve the patient of thick fluids with stinking pills or with artificial pills, and similar remedies.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	The method of the cautery for this is according to two methods: or a cautery with heating medicines, or a cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cautery with fire is according to many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of these is to cauterize over the tip of the penis three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them depth good or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let there be space that is between every cautery, the size of a finger: and let it be the oil cautery.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	But sometimes a cautery is made in the middle over the head of the penis itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore, there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you cauterize with a circle, whose form precedes the dislocation of the cautery in the process of making it, do so once: let there be a circle containing the whole penis.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn through the thickness of the skin completely.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery for sciatica, when the pain adheres to the penis itself and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize him with two cauteries over the hip, over the place where the sick person is bent, where there is pain, and your cautery on a pea four fingers wide towards the thigh: let it be the surgical knife cautery.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the sick person bends where the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize him there with a point cautery, three, or four, or more if it is necessary for him.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he bends the pain towards the leg under the knee, then cauterize him there with one surgical knife cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And remember at every one of your cauteries that you do not finish with the cautery until it burns the nerve, or a large artery, and leave behind through this something harmful to the sick person, or a constriction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And indeed I have seen one and another, among those who burned above the stone and completed their cauterization; then swelling occurred in the leg until it reached the foot, which was perforated entirely and corrupted completely: afterwards there is a wound of the abdomen, and death follows this.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If pain is in both parts at once, cauterize both according to this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise ones said about cauterization of the ankle, that this is the way to perform such an operation.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make it similar to a nail from iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let its size at the place where it's located be according to the thickness of the middle part of a finger or slightly less. And inside this nail, there should be another smaller nail third in size.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space that is between each nail be by quantity of the node of a thumb: and make nails open from both parts. And let their height be like a node or two nodes: and make for them handle made of iron that fits centrally into the nails.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is heated in the fire until it becomes red and expels sparks. Then place it on the ankle of the patient who is lying down on their healthy side under the affected foot.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore, cauterize him with three round applications of heat one after another.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then release the patient for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then dress the wound with butter: and leave the open wound to heal over many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis said, "With this type of heat application, we have used it sparingly due to the fear of its appearance. That's why there are few who dare to use it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is from among good cauteries that he who endures them and finds his place with them.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cautery with those who endure medicines is such that you should make two samia having holes, a perforated bracelet, into which descends the hinge of his door from air, or iron, the length of the walls: whose heights there are two knots among them, or as they themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be a space which is between the two quantities of thickness of a finger, and let them open below and above: and let it contain each other according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place that on the stump of the thumb, which is weak lying over the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand onto the stump of the thumb from above many times.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles made from hot water which has been heated with a fire for a short while, and hold it to the time duration of an hour: and the weak will endure its gnawing and its drying, for he found its gnawing as fire until the gnawing ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the tool and wipe off the hot water from the thumb completely along with sweet water: then release that for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter over it until the dried blackness is removed: and release that for several days, and pus will drain from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the last stage in recovery.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	And then care for that with ointment until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	And if the pain extends to the hip or thigh, have him lie on what contains water as you did for the thumb equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it down in the book on the correction of medical practices.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and the ashes from both not fully extinguished and mix them together. Clean each separately and put them in a new vessel; let its lower part be pierced with one small hole according to the quantity entering, it is as wide as your radius. Place another treated jar under the bottom of this vessel. Pour out the alkali and ashes into sweet water such that they are submerged by about an inch. Afterward press them with your hand until you get a good compression. Then let the vessel drain until the sharp water reaches the lower part of the treated vessel from below.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then mix all that water together and pour it over another layer of lime; and keep cooking until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	Indeed, it will then be of great sharpness, which is administered in many medical operations, and in cauterizing the rest of the members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the action of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And in medicines where they are used for cauterization of the anca (a type of gland), even like tesse (an herbal resin) and melanocarpus (a type of berry), and calx with soap, such that both are well mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed recounted it in his descriptions from an old practice of healing, which he used to treat pain in the anca and sciatic veins: and he praised its effectiveness greatly.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that no other treatment is needed, and that he was healed by a single means until it was reported; because perhaps he had gone into the baths when they were being prepared for treatment and came out already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is taken from the green seitaragi (a kind of herb): and if the green variety cannot be found, use the dried fresh one: it should be ground thoroughly with a little fat and applied to the area where there is pain, on the anca or thigh, or in the groin: it is then bound on and left for three hours or as long as the patient feels discomfort from its heat.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	And when his body becomes moist, introduce him into the throne (possibly referring to a surgical table or stool).
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For pain retreats and healing occurs.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you will know that no one should use a cautery with these remedies unless after bodily evacuation.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that when the urine-soaked dung of goats is used to cauterize a sciatic vein, it hardens for him; and this manner of cautery is performed.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	A piece of wool is taken and soaked in old oil, and placed over the deep spot, which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry dung from goats, and ignite it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on the wool, and remove it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat this process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	So do not cease to perform that until the sensation reaches up to the ankle through the process of treatment, and let the pain rest.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	This method of cautery is called the Goatskin Cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	### Section on the Cauterization of Back Pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Title: Chapter 44
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes back pain occurs due to various causes, either by accident, impact, excess bodily evacuation and similar cases, through the infusion of cold and moist substances. Indeed, cautery does not occur except in this single species alone, which is formed from the infusion of a cold substance.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after the bodily evacuation of the sick person with fetid pills and similar items, they should be applied over the back where pain occurs. Three lines are marked across the width of half the body, after which five or more cauterizations are made on every line using an iron point, according to the amount that comes out from the patient's tolerance under his strength: and a cautery puncture is then performed.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you have one, cauterize with three or four cauterizations, with an intermediate medial cauterization, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the method of cauterization for the initial phase of granulation tissue.
Caput XLV.	Head 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This affliction happens many times to infants of full age.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its initial phase in children is this: when a constriction occurs in breathing upon elevation and movement on him, and you find in the last vertebra of the back and his nodes that it has begun to rise above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	And when you see that and understand how to do it, then cauterize him with a ring-shaped cautery according to this method.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And take the cautery over all parts equally: and if you wish, cauterize around each vertebra with a puncture-shaped cautery of two lines or three: and let the points be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the area until it heals as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And be careful not to apply the cautery where the granulation tissue forms due to nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterization for gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Head 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are due to cold humid substances, which flow into any part of the body, then whenever pains occur in the feet, according to medical practice, they call this condition properly Gout.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	And when the cold-caused Gout is being treated with the methods of treatment and the pains are not disappearing, then the cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is that you should cauterize him after evacuation within the circumference of the feet' joining, with multiple cauterizations: and let there be an olive oil cauterization.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is the form of it.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make points on the face of the foot, then do so with point cauterization.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	And if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints and this happens many times, then cauterize him over all the knees with three cauterizations or four from each side, using this same clavii (a type of iron instrument) for the cauterization.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	And if you need more of this cauterization, then cauterize him.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand in the cauterization, but rather let its thickness be about the same as that of the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	And if the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we said about the cauterization in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	And if pains are only in the hands, then make marks around the fingers, as two lines are outlined.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	And if there remains from the pains in the fingers, then prick them, over every knuckle point, and over the hand's comb.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	And if pains rise after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize each from all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the sick from good management, by reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good treatment is done and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God using this cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Section on the manner of cauterizing in Wounds.
Caput XLVII.	Title XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or epididymis descends to the testicle, if this starts close by: then it is necessary that you quickly relieve the swelling on the day itself.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And he should use things that will cause mild irritation, so that the feces may be expelled from his own belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then place him between your hands on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath until he exhales, or it appears that the epididymis or intestine is coming out.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce him with your fingers, and apply the branding iron under the rupture on the penis bone, using a brand whose tip is similar to the radius of a circle above the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply the cautery iron, which has this shape, until the whites come out and it expels the pus.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine or epididymis back into its natural cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from escaping: and you have already opened between his thighs, and placed a pillow underneath him, and someone else is supporting his thighs, and another is supporting his chest holding hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the brand on him at the mark, with your hand holding the brand straight above him.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him until you follow the mouth with him: or alternately with him turn side by side, if you have not followed him to the mouth starting from his first position.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your act of branding, so as not to burn him and let it pass over the patient causing death or great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And you will know that when you do not follow with the brand to the mouth, your operation is not completed.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it must be that a children's cautery be fine, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care with the rest of the ointments until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let him lie ill on his own back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it must be that you give him his food according to the duration of his healing time, which soothes his stomach: so that it does not leak out at the point of entry and during digestion.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then, when you wish to have him get up after forty days, then administer a ligament made in the center, and let him hold it for forty more days with others.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should be eased from labor, and overeating of food and drink, and from loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, then he is healed with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the treatment of wounds with incisions in his chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When Wounds occur in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and you want them not to add up, then cauterize his wound with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let that which burns be as three quarters of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for it, with what we said about it: and do not let it increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some have said about the first: that the Wound should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After signing with the wax seal, and placing a line which is across the width at the upper side of the Wound, and another line downwards.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the triangular cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Regarding the method of applying cautery for pains due to situation or impact.
Caput XLVIII.	Title XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens in certain limbs due to an accident or impact: and that pain persists for a long time, and no treatment is effective with the doctors: then it must be treated by applying the punctum cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And the size of the cautery for any member should be according to its size and thickness, its weakness, its strength, the position it's in, whether it's twisted or not, and the pain it causes.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	But if not, then apply an additional cautery over it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For according to the custom of these pains, they tend to migrate from one limb to another that is closest to them.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore, you should follow the patient with the cautery until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Regarding the method of applying cautery for Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Title XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	However, for leprosy, sometimes they benefit from an intense cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy that results from putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, consider the strength to apply when treating it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If then the leprosy is growing and you have treated it as we said in the division, and it does not descend or remain stationary: and feel over the patient to see corruption spreading across their entire body: then apply the cautery on them over the head with five cauterizations: one in the middle of the head that is well-known, and the second lower towards the forehead at the end of the hairline, and two above two horns, and one behind the cervical vertebrae.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally, apply your hand with the cautery until it makes a tiny impression in the mouth and the slabs are dislodged from it. So that the emission of thick vapors from it may be alleviated, and also cauterize the spleen by applying the cautery to it again, as follows.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	And after the Leprosy has spread over the sick person and becomes evident: then it is necessary to apply these cauterizing methods that we have described in the beginning and to cauterize above the tip of the nose, and with two cauterizations on both maxilla bones, and with two cauterizations on each cervical vertebra, and six on each lumbar vertebra, and one large one over the lower tail bone and one over it at the anus. And with two cauterizations over the hips: namely, one over all of the hip, and two over knees: one for each knee, and two over shoulders, and two over arms, and two over the underside of his chest: and cauterize this above every joint from the joints of his hand fingers and feet. And cauterize above the entire heel of his foot, and both of the palm bones of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are above the last heel bone, so as not to burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized by applying the cautery to the incisors, and another time to the stomach opening, and yet another to the esophagus.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And you should know that the more you apply of the cautery, the greater is its benefit and effectiveness.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you should know that the sick person does not find pain from the cautery as they would with a healthy person; for their body is already numbed.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauterizations are of size and quality according to body parts and joints: as prescribed by the types of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care using a herb flour combined with honey for the cautery, and the remainder of the treatment, until healing occurs.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	Regarding the method of cauterization in wonderment.
Caput L.	Head L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a certain member (part of the body) is in shock and after it has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters but does not heal, then cauterize that shocked member with cauterizing substances according to its size or the degree of its decay.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And make your cautery penetrate deeply into the thickness of the skin evenly.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with salve until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes cauterization is done for certain states of shock that occur to the hand and foot, at the spine's exit points of nerves that move that member. And the shock is relieved.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	However, do not assume this for it, unless one is knowledgeable in anatomy of members and the exit pathways of moving nerves.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	Regarding the method of cauterization in Albucasis.
Caput LI.	Head 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras becomes old and nothing from the methods of medicine remains in it: then cauterize over it with a deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with herb flour and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of the arnoglossae plant, and pigeon's blood, and rabbit's blood: use a portion of each. Mix all these together and spread them on cloth, applying to the area until healing occurs.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	Regarding the method of cauterization for a cancerous condition.
Caput LII.	Head Fifty-Two.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When cancer is beginning, and you have stood it up: then burn it with a circular cauterizer as it rotates.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	The wise ones said that it should be burned by the last cauterizer in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But to me, that does not seem right; for I fear it will become infected: and I have seen that happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to burn around it with a circle, as we said, or with multiple cauterizers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	### On the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Head Fifty-Three.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Adubelati and it matures slowly, or because of excess causing it, or due to the age of the weak, when they are decrepit with little blood, or because of time and the urge to hasten its maturation for Adubelati, then cauterize around it using multiple large puncturing cauterizers.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then release her.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten in its maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you make a puncture of it with the cauterizer, then with fire burn the cauterizer, which has this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the center of the Adubelati until it penetrates the skin: and let the wound caused by that which follows be treated with clean runs.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	### On the method of cauterization in an eating away disease.
Caput LIIII.	Head Forty-Four.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	An eating away is nothing but corruption in a walking member, and it eats at that thing: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If you see corroding (deterioration) at a site that can withstand cauterization with fire, then apply multiple burn treatments using small and large iron clamps, as per what is suitable for the particular location where the corrosion is occurring.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate all the corruption, and let nothing remain of it at all.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then release (the patient) for three days, and place on the cauterized areas powdered sulfur mixed with oil until all the scabs have fallen off, and all corruption has been eliminated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for the patient using ointments to promote flesh growth.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If, however, you observe that after three days the healthy flesh is growing as if it were born anew, and there is no corruption present, this is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then apply the cauterization again over that which remains from the sites of corruption.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And sometimes the corroding (deteriorating) is treated with an acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	Indeed, it rises from the site of the cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, the application of fire during cauterization is quicker in healing: and indeed, I have already mentioned that it can be accompanied by an acute medicine in its administration. Therefore, take this method when you need it there.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	¶ On the method of cauterization for clavus (a type of boil) and verruca (a wart).
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This kind of ailment often happens in the lower parts of feet; it is a large, filtered thing that harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed, there are two ways to apply cauterization on them: cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	However, when the fire is such that it creates an iron cautery resembling a hollow pen, which is made by including the key from every part: and let there be fine edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the burning thing on the key.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the key until the cautery reaches the depth of the key: and let it be for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then cover it with a plaster of rue herbs, ground with salt, and apply the plaster to it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For he will be uprooted from his roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with an ointment for generating flesh, until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they do not heal and repeatedly occur on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet: then apply to them a cautery with warm water: and it happens that you take a tube from air, or iron, or from a bird's quill: and place it over the key, or althelul.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then introduce a small amount of water from the warm into the tube: hold your hand and rotate it with the pressure of your hand just enough so that the edge of the tube touches the root of the key, and allows the warm water to find its way down to the depth, to the root of the key: and let the patient remain for a while on the wound from the hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then remove it, for the key will be uprooted along with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this one by one until you have treated all those that come from it within the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they are uprooted, using what generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the manner of cauterization in Tremonia.
Caput LVI.	Head 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone Tremonia due to cold on a nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary that you burn him with four burns, or five over the spinous processes of the back, and between every spinous process with a burn, and in his chest with a burn, and over his stomach with a burn.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For Tremonia stops when burned with oil and the health of cold sickness advances.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cauterization for Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Head 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	At times, within the body of an Albathir, evils are expelled, that is, pus blisters which come from corrupted matters.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, it should be done firstly when they appear, that each head of the pus blister be burned with a fine cauterizer dipped in myrtle wood which has been lit by fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the long root of Aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lens-shaped cauterizer.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are burned at the anus, at the beginning of their expulsion according to this manner: and they do not increase: and a surplus is broken causing them to be cured from it.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, this must happen after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the manner of cauterization during blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Head 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many times there is blood flow from an artery which has been cut at the wound, that happens externally, or at the cut made by lancet, or similar things to them: and it becomes difficult to remove it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When such a thing happens to someone, then promptly approach with your hand towards the opening of the artery and place your index finger on it: and squeeze it much until the blood is confined under your finger and does not escape from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place a small olive oil cauterizing iron into the fire, and heat it to a high temperature: and blow upon it until it becomes well lit.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one or two, little or large, according to the size of the wound and the place where the artery has been severed, and place the cauterizing iron upon that vein, after which you remove your finger promptly: and hold the cauterizing iron until the blood is withdrawn.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If the blood is expelled when you raise your finger from the opening of the artery and you extinguish the cauterizing iron, then take another cauterizing iron promptly, from those that are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So do not stop doing this with one after another until the blood is withdrawn.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful, do not burn the nerves which are there, and let some other mischief happen to the weak due to it.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is impossible to withdraw it: especially when the artery is large, unless with one or four measures.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cauterizing iron, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or through extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities contract and the blood is withdrawn.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it can be tied with a thread using strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or apply medicines of their nature which cause blood withdrawal and bind with an appropriate constriction using a pulley.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Those who perform amputation with ligature and bandage compression, or the arrangement of burning things and similar ones, do not completely remove them, except occasionally.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If however, this happens to someone and there is no present doctor nor medicine, then he should start by placing the position of the index finger over the opening of his own vein, as we have described, and with extreme constriction until the blood is bound from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger is not removed; instead, it remains with cold water from above constantly until cooled down, until the blood congeals and thickens, and then it should be cut.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, he should consider what is needed from cautery or from medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	¶ The End of the First Part.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	¶ On Incisions, Perforations, and Venous Bleeding in Wounds, and Similar Conditions.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have spoken about it in the first chapter, all illness where it is appropriate to use fire and burning medicine together, its causes, occasions, its tools, and forms of cautery.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed the headings from head to foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that it may be helpful to him who seeks what is sought.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin this, you should learn from children or sons what is to be found here in this chapter on fear which was mentioned in the first chapter about cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of this, there should be greater caution in it, since in the operation described in this chapter, many times evacuation occurs with blood, which is a sign of life at the opening of a vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening at the exit wound, or treatment for wounds, or extraction of arrows, or incision over a stone, and similar cases: from all these there comes trembling and fear, and death falls upon many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, do not fall into the thing that is hesitated upon, for sometimes such matters of men come to you in this art with their illnesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For there are those who become angry with their illness, and death is gentle to him; due to the intensity of what he discovers from his illness and the length of his malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when illness arises from fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from these, there are those who give you their kindness and enriches you with it, hoping for healing, and his illness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it is not necessary to agree with him who comes to you from these, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more intense than your greed and your insatiable desire.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume about anything from him, unless after certain knowledge which verifies that admirable succession to what it has come about with you.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use it in the care of all your patients, prediction and indication for what would suitably bring health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	And in that there is assistance for you in the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, my children, his understanding, and not remove your guidance and inspiration from you, for that is within his power.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And indeed, I have organized this chapter by dividing it into sections, following the order in Chapter 'The use of the cautery', from neck to feet: so that you may find what you are seeking from it and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	¶ On the treatment of water which is gathered in children's heads.
Caput I.	Head I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this illness often happens to infants during childbirth: or when the midwife is gripping the head of the infant without lifting it.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it also happens for an unknown cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed, I have not seen this illness in others as in infants: and death has approached every one of them from that. Therefore, it seems to me fitting for me to refrain from performing operations in such cases.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I have seen an infant among them whose head was filled with water and the size of its head increased every day until it could no longer sit on itself due to the size of its own head: and the moisture increased until death occurred.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed either accumulates between the skin and the mouth or accumulates under the bone above the jaw.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And if the operation is to be performed, and there's moisture between the skin and the mouth and the abscess is small, then you should make a cut in the middle of the head with a width: and let the length of the cut be like two nodes until the moisture passes.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If however the moisture has increased more and the abscess is larger, then place these two cuts according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone and its sign is that you see openings of the skull from every part: and water is pressed down when you press it with your hand to the interior, and whatever does not hide itself from you: then you should make three cuts in the middle of the head, according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after making the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the wounds with cloths and powders.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then cleanse that from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then release the bandage, and take care of the wound with lint and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not relax the binding on the head to an equal degree.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick with all dry food that has little moisture, until the member is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another measure for an incision is to assess where the size of the boil becomes visible and the collection of pus.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes there is more in the back of the head, or at the top of the head, or on the right side, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, ascend with your incision wherever you see the boil and accumulation of pus: and divide that according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe to not cut the artery and let blood flow out, and have the sick die from that flow with the loss of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Section on incisions of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Head II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When such a thing happens to someone with a cough reaching the eyes, or to the chest, and it becomes chronic, not treating it with medical means is more. Then, the last resort treatment for that is through the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you wish to cut them, the sick person must shave their head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the area with coarse cloth until the arteries become visible.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then, the sick person should bind their neck with any of their own cloth.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse lies.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both are those that are depressed behind the ears: and it rarely disappears, unless in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then apply signs with the hot wax on both sides; and cut both using the sharp lancets until you reach the mouth: and this should be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if possible, insert the lancet under the artery and cut it upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be about as long as two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood comes out with the pulsation flow which jumps into the organs with frequent leaps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery is not apparent to touch, then it must be measured from the ear by an extent of space equal to three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then apply signs with hot wax and cut until you reach the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what needs to be emitted from the blood is six uncia and perhaps you might emit more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	Do the entire operation according to the quantity that you perceive from the patient's illness and the filling of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider it applied to the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains near the mouth from it, then cut that part in order to avoid a hot boil: then bind the wound with linen thread.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	And then care for it with ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	### Section on the Removal of Arteries, Which Are in the Joints
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a person with an old half-headache, or acute colds due to acidic humidities and warmth in the joints of the limbs, or old soda and similar things: and he is treated with the methods of medical treatment, and does not match that; then we are familiar with these illnesses involving the extraction of arteries from the joints, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And concerning the manner of operation in their removal, it is that the patient shaves the hairs which are on the flaps and aims at the visible artery in the flap.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For she is shown to you by her own pulse and rarely is hidden except in a few people or cases of coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	And if it is hidden from you, then the patient should tie their head with any piece of cloth: afterwards rub the area with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or wet the spot with hot water until you see it clearly manifestly.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I shaped before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	And then scrape off the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	And then push in a hook into it and pull it upwards until you remove it from the skin, making sure to allow it to come out from all sides of the garments that are beneath it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however, the artery is delicate, then wrap it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that part according to the length of its ends which stretch and are shortened, so that there is no flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut or removed completely, the blood does not rise fully.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate the blood from six uncia (approximately 20ml) up to three uncia (approximately 10ml).
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And if the artery is large, then you should tie it in two places with a strong double thread of silk or alcohol strings so that it does not extend towards the same before the healing of wounds, and there may be no flow of blood.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut off the excess which is between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Perform that operation at that hour, or another hour afterwards.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if it is a vein, cauterize it with a cauterizing tool until you reach the opening, using a surgical knife. Continue until its ends are reached and the site of the operation remains stable.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	It is better if the sick person has a fever, or their complexion becomes hot.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because cauterization is from those things which assist in stopping moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore, it is better for assistance.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the arteries have been extracted, it is necessary to fill the cavity with old cloth: and they should place over it central-woven reeds.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the wound has been cleaned, it is treated with dry medicines that promote flesh growth, and with herbs, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If during the operation a blood flow occurs from an artery, then quickly cut it with a cautery or fill the place with wax until the blood stops. Hold your hand tightly until the blood is stopped.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If nothing of those things is available to you, then place your finger on the site until the blood coagulates.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And immerse the site with boiling water until the pain subsides and tighten according to what is needed.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is lighter and easier to extract an artery, it is done by cauterizing a vein with this type of cautery that has two knives: let the sharpness of the two knives be like that of amalgam.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, it is much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are as sharp as two knives, each causes coldness to spread: and it does not cut the flesh at speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When therefore there is a certain amount of thickness in them, heat of the fire is held in them, and flesh is cut off quickly; thus this makes every operation better, lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let there be a space that is between the two knives a breadth of a finger, after you mark two places with a hot iron: and remove both the heated ends thoroughly until they reach the mouth and penetrate in two places. So as to extend what is between its extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For this cautery does not harden completely.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	¶ On the care for frequent, continuous watering eye discharges from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Title IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are frequent tears, and you see a flow of them from the eyes which are above the head, outside on the skull: and there is no need for any medical treatment among medicines in this case; and you observe the patient's face already turning red, and he feels a wandering sensation on his forehead, just like when ants wander: and his eyes are weakened, wet, to the point that even the hair follicles have corroded with the tears. And his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears; then the old men resorted to this treatment in their care for them, and named it after 'En', referring to a specific procedure or method used historically for such conditions.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is that you should shave off the hairs which are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three cuts on the forehead that are equidistant according to the length of the forehead. And let the length of each cut be about two fingers long. The first cut should be equidistant from the nose's length at the middle of the forehead, and the second one is along the length following where tears flow, slightly more than halfway down. The third cut goes across from the other side. Be cautious not to cut through arteries that are on both sides of your incision area. Extend your hand from the continuation of both cheeks, and make all incisions have a total width equivalent to about three fingers joined together. Prepare a piece of sponge or dry pieces of cloth for you, with which to soak out blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert the spatula of the two sharp extremities, whose following form is.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is on the part of the tympanum, up to the second incision: and scrape with it the entire skin, which is between the two incisions, together with the siphon, which is above the mouth.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do this also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this spatula, and insert another tool again, which is called the sharp surgical knife, gently from one side, not sharply from the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh joined with skin, and its flat side gently towards the mouth: and push it until it reaches the middle cut: and remove with it all the fat which descends from the head to the eyes: except that continues in the cut up to what is visible through the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do this until you reach the other cut (opening) in the middle cut.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after the flow of blood is equal to that quantity, press out the places from the clots of blood on the surface.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place linseed oil from old cooked material throughout every cut, and place on them powders soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see to it that no boil appear hot.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, untie the bandage, and administer plenty of water-based infusion.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with balsam and other remedies used for wounds until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Section: Care of sharp tears and mucous discharges to the eyes from within the head.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When a sudden cough occurs to someone, treat them continuously and regularly. Examine their eyes which may have become exhausted, reddened, or already weakened in appearance: and find that the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall from them; also there's an intense pain deep within the head, causing it to be hurt by and following sneezing: then consider these symptoms; unless they come about due to many veins, neither cough nor mucus would arise otherwise.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is that you advise the sick person to shave their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make an incision in the head, one in the middle of the forehead or slightly off-center along its width. Start your cut from the left side moving towards the right side and continue it until you reach the mouth: extend your hand away from the movable temporal bones which move during chewing. Continue the cut until the mouth is fully exposed. Then, with a sponge, dry all the blood completely.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two incision flaps with a surgical instrument like an ointment scoop or with thread made of linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then apply the poultice from above using grains of it: and soak the grains with wine and oil so that no heat blister occurs.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you release that, and see that the heat blister is now diminishing: then it must be that you rub the mouth until flesh begins to form within it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then take care of it with an evaporation regimen that makes flesh develop: like if you take two parts from wheat flour and four parts of colophony (a type of resin): prepare this mixture as a plaster and apply it for the development of flesh in these wounds until flesh begins to form.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On the care for what falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Title VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Every object that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: it could be a mineral stone, like iron or tin; it could resemble a stone, such as being made of plant material, like chickpeas and beans; it might be some kind of flexible substance, like water, vinegar, and similar things; or it could be some kind of animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	So when a stone (or a similar object) falls into the ear, you should expose the ear to the sun. If you then see the stone, distill something from castor oil or flaxseed in the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then perform the extraction of it and make him sneeze while he is being rubbed, and pinch his nostrils at the onset of sneezing. After that, place some shredded cloth or wool around the edge of the ear, and then spread the ear towards the top.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Indeed, this treatment is performed many times.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If however it doesn't come out, then perform the extraction with Gesti, that is, with fine pizzigarioli needles: its shape is as follows.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	So if it comes out with gesticulation, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then perform the extraction using a blind, fine, somewhat double-bladed tool (uncino caeco).
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	So if it doesn't come out through that, then make a tube from air, and insert the end of the tube into the ear opening very much, and force inside what is in the circumference of the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no wind other than the tube: then pull it out with your strong suction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Indeed, this method often works as we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If this method does not work either: then take from the helkali bag or from the shark's stomach, that is, a small amount of the substance used to catch birds. Place this inside at the end of the radius after you have centered it on the tympanic membrane when placed inwards towards the ear canal: afterwards insert this into the ear opening with ease after removing the wax from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not work with all that we have narrated, then hasten to cut before a hot pus blister occurs or a cramp.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method for cutting is as follows: first apply it to the weak one in the cephalic region: and remove him from his blood according to the strength of its effect.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Next have the patient sit between your hands and turn their ear upwards. Make a small incision at the base of the ear in the fatty area below its depression, and let it be shaped like a crescent until you reach the stone: then remove it along with what is possible for you using the tools that are at hand.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then heal the cut from your own time with speed and care until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If the matter falling into the ear has increased from one grain and swells up, then administer its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If however it does not respond to you for an outcome, then take the spasmile which is slight and of this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer it with that from the grains which fall into the ear, and do not make this assumption when you think that that grain has already become moistened through the vapor of the ear until you place it as much in fragments: afterwards remove them with hooks, or with a subtle tool, or by suction as we said, for its extraction will be facilitated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water that enters the ear, the patient must use a cough with condensation first: and now fills his ear with some warm water: and he is lying on that ear, in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out through that [method], it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin and soft, heat them with fire moderately, and let the patient insert one of these into his ear opening: and lets sprinkle water from that part on his foot, and hits it with another stone over the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	So do not stop doing this procedure with stones until all of the water has come out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now water comes out like this, that you take one from the reed or from a straw and insert one of its ends into the ear. And you ignite the other end with fire until it burns much of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another reed and do this many times until all of the water has come out. And remove it together with the tube as indicated in the stone procedure.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	During the removal of the animal entering it, if it is a small body, like a flea and similar to it, take care of it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body that appears by sense: then administer the removal of its extraction with gestures and hooks: and its release is easier than all those which are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	During the removal of worms hatched in the ear, when you care for it with what we said in division and in the treatment of distillations, and your care does not match: then you should inspect the ear in sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If something appears there from the worms, then extract that with forceps or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however nothing is seen there, then take a cannula, which has this form, narrow at the bottom, wide at the top: and insert its subtle end into the ear according to what the diseased person can bear. Then suck with that strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all the worms have come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If however they do not obey you for an exit, then fill the circumference of the cannula with oil, as I said about the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not come out with what we said: then administer the distillations that the ancients were familiar with for the infection of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring be of the oil and medicines you apply to the ear with this tool, as its form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it of silver or tin, with the lower part being narrow and containing small holes, but wider at the top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	So it should be that which pushes inside in the hollow of the cannula is made from tin and is centrally formed.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a reed and wrap its tip in the appropriate winding. Then produce oil, or juice, or whatever you want from these medicines into the cannula, and let it be inside the ear. Then insert the reed with its wrapper above, pressing it gently until the oil is pushed into the auditory cavity, which should be felt internally by the patient. And that substance poured into the ear should already have been warmed evenly by fire. Be careful not to use substances that are distilled and very cold; medicines do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the care for complications arising from ear operations.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs without being punctured.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it happens to some individuals where the operation in the ear through a wound, or flesh born within it, leads to complications.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	This operation sometimes happens deep within the ear's passage which does not follow the user's path; and at other times it occurs slightly towards the outer part of the passage and follows that user.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, what happens deep within the ear, and which cannot be comprehended by the eye, is in many positions difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And for the operation which follows the user, you need to place the ear of the sick in sunlight and observe it. Then, if you see an apparent operation, open it with a thin spatula tool, whose shape is as follows; its tip has a small width, where part of it is sharp: and the rest of the spatula should be between two soft sides so that it doesn't hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If the operation is from flesh born within the ear passage: then hold it with a thin hook and cut it with force until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the operation is deep within the ear: then take a thin, soft needle, heat it slightly with fire, and then insert it into the ear passage.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you sense the operation with what the patient finds when they have a heavy hearing, try to open it gently: and beware, do not pierce the ear nerves.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear according to the size of the passage you have enclosed in the Egyptian ointment, do this for several days until you are sure about the healing of the wounds.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Take the licorice, and pour it into rose-colored water, then grind over it powdered zedoary, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the pustule has already erupted: then you must take the licorice and allow it to be mixed with another substance that will be introduced into the caeroto which should have been made with rose oil until the pustule cools down. Then, attend to it until it is fully healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If however, a flow of blood occurs: then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water, and place it over the ear: and use the rest of the treatment which stops blood flow as described in the chapter on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Section: On the treatment of Eyelid (Altheli) Wounds.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Altheli (wounds) that occur on the eyelids of the eye, sometimes they become moist and then dry out.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers or a hook and puncture them from their roots with the lancets.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place powdered zedoary on the affected areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens-shaped cauterizing instrument.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And the cauterization should be done better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	Many times they recur when there is something left from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not recur.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Section: On the treatment of Eyelid Granulomas (Grandinum) of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often something occurs in the eyelids that resembles the Crandini in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is named Grando: it is an aggregation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid, and also on the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore the operation is this: when you then inspect it, if there is a Grando proceeding from it visible on the eyelid and moving to every part of it, and its nature is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore find a cut across it across its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then remove it from all sides with ease until it is gone.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If it is not cut for you without bleeding at all until after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision, then that weak thing can harm in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the cut is large: then bind that with stitches: and take care of it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come from it to you.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment restores it and toughens it up.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if Grando is descending towards the inner ear and against the inner surface, then turn the eyelid and hang the mass with a hook. Apart from that you need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	And if the eyelid is lengthened through an incision, that does no harm to anything.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision with vinegar water: and take care of the area with whatever toughens it up until the patient is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	¶ Concerning the care of eyelashes.
Caput X.	Head X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	The end is sebum which is generated in the upper eyelid tunics: and this happens quite often to children: and it grates on their eyes, and they have watering in the mornings, and they cannot see the sun's light because tears come near them, therefore you see them lying down on their faces always, and sleep on them, and their eyelids are wet under their eyebrows, which has been filled by puffiness: and the Axirnath appears quite clearly to the eye, and when you press that place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its treatment is such that the patient places his head on your breast.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take flaxen cloth and prepare a paste of nitre in it. Make a circular patch from this paste with an area equal to that containing Axirnath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on her, and press it with your fingers all around, so that Axirnath is collected in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find the center of that wet area with an incision through the mucus, making the incision across its width, and not a larger incision like those made in bloodletting at their deepest point.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or you should find the entire skin until you reach Axirnath. For Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the shape of a small white fatty lump in various placements.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	So remove it with the cloth you had soaked between your fingers up to the outside. And move your hand to the right and left until everything is spread out: and be careful not to add anything into the incision so that you do not end up putting mucus on the eye, which would harm it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If indeed you do not see Axirnath at the beginning of the wound opening, then you should apply a little with ease to the wound opening until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract her, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the affected area, and bind it with powders.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And among humans there are those who grind salt and place it in the concavity of the wound, so that what remains from that moisture will dissolve.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however an abscess occurs in the hot place, then take care of it with calming plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Section on methods of treating Ataxmir for the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft, causing it to rub like it shouldn't.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hair grows on the eyelids beyond the usual growth of natural hairs and becomes long: they then harm the eye and cause many discomforts such as frequent tears, softening of the eyelids, and puffiness, until this reason for the destruction of the eye occurs.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed, treatment for Ataxmir of the eye follows four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or through cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with an acute medicine, as provided in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is treated by making an incision and缝合 it.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or through canals, as I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the sick head on your breast.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If therefore it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not, introduce the point into it, where is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the point go through with the thread above, and let that be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs are born: and pull the thread up together with the eyelid and its radius, and turn it upwards.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find within the part of the eyelid under the added hairs, until you reach with spatula from the larger lacrimal to the smaller.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread, and place under the eyelid a small cotton ball or cloth. Then mark above the eyelid with the branding iron, so that it looks like a figure of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it must happen that the figure is according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this already varies among humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there are those who need that the amount by which it hits from the eyelid is large, according to the amount which softens from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, with the spatula, find above the two lines you marked, and start from the larger lacrimal to the smaller one, and let there be a single tear-like opening close to the natural hairs, as is the thickness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce the hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape off the whole thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then, with needle and fine wool thread, stitch together the two lips using a sharp tool: and clean off any blood, and ensure that what is extraneous from the threads covering the two eyebrows stays there if you want to do it this way; and if not, don't bother.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then remove the suture and thread up to three days, or four: afterwards take care of that.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if there is a wound, remove it without suture, and take care of it, which dries and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	The eyelid is raised at the seal wound and its gathering: but the future is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of treatment for Ataxmir was taught by the ancients.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	But indeed concern over the sick person is there, and it comes from good treatment, and not within it is fear.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is used for Ataxmir as well: and it is that you draw signs over the eyelid to form a figure which looks like the shape of a leaf of laurel, just as we have described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then raise the eyelid with three separate or grouped crescents, according to this shape that follows, then cut what remains hanging with the outer edges of the blades, according to this shape, with equal incisions.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold the crescent and it does not match that: then take one with a thread in which you will insert it in the middle of the figure. And insert another thread near the tear duct on the larger side, and another thread near the tear duct on the smaller side. Then group together the threads between your fingers with equal spacing.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand at an equal elevation: and lift the skin upon which there is marked out the fold as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips with a suture over the wound: and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if indeed an abscess should occur at your incision or crack: then remove that abscess with a piece of wadding, and do so similarly using ointments for soothing.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And it sometimes happens that even eyelashes can turn into their hair.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you must use what we said about cutting: but stitching is much more artificial for both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	¶ On the care of Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is to convert the eyelid and divide the fissure which is above, according to what I have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two canna (a type of instrument used for suturing) or two slender sticks. The length of these should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of the suture thread. And you have already incised at both ends where you hold the thread from each side.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather both with the slightness above that which protrudes from the eyelid, and bind two canna (medical instruments) tightly around each side of the suture, exerting a firm tension, and let them off for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	The skin, when tightened, will die, darken, and decompose until it falls off on its own.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore the healing is delayed, then cut it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it is consolidated, lift the eyelid: and do not allow the hair to poke through.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is how the two canna (medical instruments) should be made, as per this figure, and their size according to length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	¶ On the removal of irritating hairs in the eye with an incision.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The procedure is to take a fine needle and gently introduce a fine silk thread into it.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then unite its extremities and bind both knots with a very fine thread: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then compose another fine thread in Alinxotati beneath it for a short distance, and bind the ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then the sick person should place their head in your bosom, and have it near the sun to show the operation: for the operation is subtle or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the point with Alinxotatis into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid as quickly as possible until you remove the natural hair above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up above Alinxotatis: and introduce that hair into Alinxotatis: if it is one, or two, or three, no more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out through the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If however Alinxotatis is pulled and the hair does not come out with it: pull Alinxotatis downwards, with the thread you composed in it, until Alinxotatis exits through the hole above, and observe it visually: then pull Alinxotatis and the string: and extract both of them, and close the eye: and let him rest with the eye closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and grows over it flesh.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	Now if the hair is short, then either associate it with a long hair from natural hairs, and raise it with it: or let him go until he stretches after some space, and then raise him.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	¶ Regarding the care of Alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens in the eye according to Alxatrati, it is named Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this according to Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore, the accidental one occurs from the healing of wounds, or from sections, or from cauterizations, and similar procedures.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of performing this is, to find that healing process, and to separate its edges, and to place within it something from linen that is between them, and to bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary to use things that dry and tighten during its treatment; for if you do this, Alxatrati says that the outcome will be worse than before. Rather, use things that soften, like Greek fennel: mix them with water in which poppy seeds have been boiled, linen seeds: and ointment made from some of the oils: and wrap it with something between these two, and take care of it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your treasury of treatment is to use all your ingenuity so that it does not harden, according to its original shape.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	Indeed, the operation we have described is merely a correction according to Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return completely as it was.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	¶ The care according to Alxatrati that occurs in the lower eyelid, and it is a wrinkle or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This, according to Alxatrati which occurs below, is truly what Alxatrati names.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is both natural and accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one occurs from a wound, or a crack, or cauterization, and similar procedures.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And concerning the operation for this, you should take one with two threads and insert it into the flesh, making it penetrate from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Next extend the flesh upwards with the tip, and cut it with a broad scalpel.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the returned shape of the eyelid is as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a thread and place it in the slit, then turn the eyelid with it. Create two slits on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of these slits be from both corners of the incision until they meet and form an angle: until they join, this forms the shape of them, and it is the Greek letter 'lauda'.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh in the amount which corresponds to its narrow lower edge, starting from where it follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Next, join the separated parts together: sew them with wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with what we have said about softening medicines and ointments until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if Alxatrati should occur from the slit or suture, or with cautery: then it is necessary to create a flat slit under the eyelashes hairline, even if it follows beforehand.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the two lips with an ointment as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the main point regarding caring for Alxatrati is that it should be treated in that operation according to how preparation from the shape of Alxatrati has been made.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is indeed a multitude of diversities in its shape: and the prudent artisan prepares his skill with whatever manner is possible for him, until he returns to the form that is natural or close to it. And the sick person himself adjusts according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	At times this condition occurs in many people, such that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from performing its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the end of the rod under the eyelid and lift it upwards: or extend it with a hook. Then strike the adhesion with a small sharp blade, so that it not be against the sharpness of the incision of the blades, rather it should be blunt slightly. So that the patient is not disturbed during surgery, and removes the blade, and injures the eye with its sharpness: and your cut as if you were scraping away this adhesion as easily until when returns the eyelid according to its natural form, and heals completely the adhesion.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salty water into the eye and wash it out with that water: or distill it onto it from the product made, from zinc dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linseed blade: and place over the eye wool soaked in the white of the eye. And on the third day use the product, and with the hardened ones, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	¶ On the incision of the nail and prominence of the tear-producing tissue.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail is according to two manners.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous: and it is similar to a hard saw, thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to the consistency of water that has frozen and turned white; which when touched by a metal tool or tried to grasp it with a hook, it can be cut off and the hook does not get stuck in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And neither of these types begin unless from the greater lacrimal gland, until it proceeds gradually, until it accomplishes its purpose, and obstructs the passage, and stops the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method for performing an incision is as follows: let the sick place his head on your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather the nail with a small double fold clipper, and extend it towards the top.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take the tip, and insert it into a hair from horses', cows, or goats: and make sure it's strong and thickly twine its extremity around the edge of the nail halfway, fix it in the middle of the nail: then pierce it with the tip and tie it to the nail with thread. Extend that towards the top: and scrape off the side of the nail that follows the pupil as if you were holding it together with hair all the way up to its root.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then make the remaining cut in the root of the lacrimal gland with a thin spatula or with clamps: and remove the natural tissue of the lacrimal gland so that there is no continuous flow of tears from his incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with just a single clipper: or with thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it off with a soft spatula, which has this shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the spatula touch the cornea's skin, and cause damage or perforation of the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the cut, pour some powdered salt or sifted zinnia into the eye and let it out until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it along with what needs to be done, until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the hoof is not horny and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor can you implant a hook within it, then this type of hoof should be treated repeatedly with medicines. It will heal as I have described in the section.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you intend to penetrate it, then open the eye of the diseased one, and take a delicate spatula, gently and weakly sharp, according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the hoof from above with reason and subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is becoming rarefied and collapsing, and if reason impresses itself into her, then distill from your hour into the eye from a sieve made of zinc, or from a red sieve, or ground salt: and fill the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then iterate over this operation until everything of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there appears to you in the eye a warm blister: then indeed remove her, and care for the blister until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then iterate the operation over her with reason until she is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The prominence of the eyelid tissue, if it causes damage in the eye that is significant, should be suspended with a hook and cut from its part. Do not make the final incision so as to avoid any flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then distill from a red sieve or made of zinc in the tear duct until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	¶ Concerning the operation on Alguardenic and the tissue that is born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in certain people's eyes, a red tissue is born or overlaid until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses against the eyelids and may even turn the eyelids outward. It is likened to a small rose of red color.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And there is an operation for that too, so that the sick person may place his head on your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and gather that whole piece of flesh together with the appropriate hooks for this task: and hold that with one pair of forceps, or by handling it.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh from the beginning until you finish it all with the help of the incisors.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful not to harm the eye during surgery: and make your cut where you are about to cut it, or use small spatulas, as we described in the cutting of claws: or use large forceps with which the seabeel is collected, according to how its form will come after this head.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	And when your cut is complete and the entire augeare has been removed, then fill the eye with ground salt: or distill into it red powder, and similar things from corrosive medicines: and place over the eye of the outside an ointment cloth with wool: so that it may be protected from hot steam.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If any remains from the augeare and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess, then take out the eye and care for it with what stops an abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then apply it to the affected area during surgery until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do so with flesh that may occur in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that the care of any weak eye from one's own natural or accidental cause should be performed with iron when operating: and do not interfere with your hand in any of these operations until you realize that this member is enduring that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	¶ On the removal of the seabeel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	The disease is of red spots that cover the eye, and hinder its own action: and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, you must first consider whether the eye in which Sebel is present is strong and there is no other illness in it besides Sebel: then collect Sebel from its (the eye's) (location or context).
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And you should do this to the sick person, that he places his head in your bosom.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those reds with one hook or two according to your judgement: and let the hook be fine of duplication, as per this form, or let there be two hooks graduated within one body, as per this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with fine forceps those reds with fineness, and cleanse the blood hour after hour, until you see those reds being removed from the eye, and dissolve: and beware not to harm the eye with the cutting instruments.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be steadfast in your operation greatly: so that you do not fall upon other reds unless they are those ones.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have completed, then distil into the eye a green or red sieve: so that its sharpness may polish what remains from Sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If however it is not possible for you to collect all of that in that hour, then smear the eye with what soothes the eye's pain: and let it rest a few days until its pain subsides: and it should be protected from hot wind: then repeat it according to the same method until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the Reduction of Arissati to the Nose.
Caput XIX.	Head 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Doctors name the condition 'Arissati Fistula', which they treat with cautery or with a burning topical medicine, as per what has been previously mentioned in their account.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it is not cured, then there is no skill in that matter: unless you mark out the site of the blister at birth and remove all the moisture contained therein along with pus until the mouth is revealed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	And when the mouth is revealed and you see corruption or blackness within it, then cut it out with an instrument whose shape is like this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And they are called Rough Headings.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Make it out of iron and have its head round like an azir, let it be perforated with the tip of a file or a finely sharpened point made from alum knive steel: place it upon the corrupted part of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll it between your fingers and press your hand slightly until you know that the corruption has been removed. And do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the site with drying,收敛 and cauterizing medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the site has consolidated and flesh is formed within it, and after this healing process, if the process of cutting off ceases: then continue for forty days, should there be no recurrence, nor blistering nor occurrence in that place, then you will know that it has been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill within it unless it can reduce the fistula to the nasal aperture as per this manner.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And proceed as follows: cut it out from the bone again either with iron or with a burning medicine; and when the mouth is revealed, then take the drill according to this manner, its tip should be made of iron and triangular shaped. And let the wood part of it be like a pyramid narrowed down up until the tip, as you can see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that over the mouth itself: and let it be near the tear ducts: and extend your hand from the eye somewhat.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the pincers until it penetrates the mouth, and the patient should feel this: through this, when he finds a breeze coming out of it, while holding his hand on top of his own nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	So then restore the site with drying styptic medicines, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	And when the flesh is born and the site hardens, then the material which was flowing externally returns to the nose: hence it is lighter for the patient.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	¶ On reducing the prominence of the eye.
Caput XX.	Title XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye is elevated with all its entirety, and does not cause harm in use nor diminution, then you must free the patient. Next perform bloodletting on him. Then place suction cups at the neck without incision, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place on the eye a liniment made from acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye from above over the plaster with many powders.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the amount of powders is such that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth is doubled over four times: make them into many: then place them one upon another according to the quantity needed by the eye: then bind them with a hard cloth in a strong bandage.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeatedly apply suction cups with suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the suction cups, and allow the eye to be bandaged during the day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If indeed the bandage once again becomes soft, then it must be tightened significantly: afterwards remove the bandage each day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If you see that the eye has already returned to its normal condition, it is good; and if not, then apply successive bandages, and powders, and tightness, and ventilations, until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	¶ On cutting the Uvea tissue.
Caput XXI.	Title XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a disruption occurs in the Uvea tissue, then it protrudes and extends beyond the eyelids like a grain of the Uvea, and causes damage to the human form due to this; and it allows ingress for this: then an operation is performed on it, according to what I describe, and it is that you insert the point in the root of the Uvea from the lower part to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another point with a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and remove the first needle according to its placement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut into the location of the double thread, and bind it with the portion of the Uvea around a needle: and tighten it significantly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the needle, and place a woolen cloth soaked in almond oil on the eye: and leave it until the thread comes out with the Uvea.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with that, which strengthens it, until the wound heals completely.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the Uvea is tightened with a circle of cloth from all sides until the eye attains great elevation.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pierce it with a fine awl so that it reaches the depth of the eye, and allows the humidity of almond oil to flow in, causing the eye to descend immediately afterwards; then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	The Care of Alcoman.
Caput XXII.	Head Twenty-Two.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This illness which is called Alcomnati is not truly pus, which accumulates in the eye, similar to water flowing down, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	The method of operation for this involves having the patient sit on a prepared chair or stand straight.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head of the patient with your hands from both sides, and move it until you feel pus coming down to your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Next, it is depicted and does not descend, and the passage clears: and the patient sees as he saw before: and if it does not descend below, you know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however the descent of pus with what we said does not get prepared, then have the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take the spatula finely and make contact with it slightly above the cornal membrane at the junction with the conjunctiva near the corona until pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Once it comes out, then pour warm water into the eye that you had mixed with honey: or water in which you already boiled Greek fennel and honey: afterwards continue treatment with other treatments until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	¶ On the care of water that descends into the eye, or cataracts.
Caput XXIII.	Head Twenty-Three.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already described the nature of water in division and what is suitable for perforation by speaking about it and demonstrating it. Then take this same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it will be necessary to make the patient sit between your hands as a square, facing away from the light, near the sun: and tie his healthy eye, and grip it tightly: then with your right hand touch the eyelid of his eye which has water if that is the left eye: or with your left hand if the eye is on the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand if the eye is on the left side: or with your left hand if the eye is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the agathode near the crown along the thickness of the radius in the apparent white area of the eye's lesser lacrimal. Then push the agathode with force, and you turn your hand until it penetrates into the whiteness of the eye: and you feel that the agathode has already reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And the measurement of the agathode's journey to depth must be equal to the space that exists from the pupil to the end of the darkened area: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	Indeed, you will see these things within the pupil through the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea's coat.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the agathode until it reaches the spot where water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it down with a vice one after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person will see that which he opens his vision to immediately, and the agathode in his own eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then remove it slowly after what has left the agathode.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it is removed and does not rise: then draw out the agathode with ease: and you turn your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve some clear crystal salt in water, and wash the eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place the entire poultice or oil-soaked rose-oil cotton outside the eye, and let it cool. Then tie the healthy eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We and those who are of our time place upon him a fine powder mixed with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the alum (or galena) does not enter into the eye because of its hardness, since there are people whose eye is very hard, then you must take a tool that is called Alberid, which has this form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Pierce it only with the circular ring and do not insert your whole hand into the hole; just make a passage to the subtle place under the alum.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the alum as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the weak patient a somewhat offset bed where he can sleep on his back in a dark room. And prevent him from any movements and coughing. Provide food suitable for him according to what soothes his nature, and let neither his right nor left hand move at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage be according to its position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then release him in that dark room and test his condition; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	And then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary to do that at the time of treatment or immediately after cutting: rather, you should avoid that; because water rises quickly through intense exposure.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If however a warm boil occurs, then you should release the eye before the seventh day: and correct that with whatever stops the boil until it is stopped. Then completely assess its condition and place on his face an opening through which to regulate its use for several days while he remains in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then gradually leave your house and familiarize yourself with your rooms.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And you will know that the student should not be prevented from seeing during zals (a short period of fasting): then he dares to see over an operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed, some of those who were from Alayrac have reached us, who said that an excavation was made in Alayrac to create a well, through which water is extracted.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But indeed, I have not seen anyone on your land who has done this; nor have I read of it in any ancient books. And it is possible that this might be new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of species from the well, so they can stand above it for those who do not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made from pure air: and may their ends with this have the same fineness of triangular shape, and an acute end.
Formae magda.	The forms of the well.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Chapter on the care of the newly born flesh in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Title: Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes, various kinds of flesh are born in the nose, from which there is something that resembles many-legged scorpions. From this comes cancerous flesh, stone-like, with a light color, and from it comes soft flesh, not with a light color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, for the soft flesh that is neither deceptive nor cancerous among those from such meats, you must make them sit an infant between your hands facing the sun, and open their nostrils, and push a hook into those kinds of flesh. Then draw them out to the outer parts, and when you have identified what you understand from them with finely sharp spathuli (medical instruments), until you know that all the flesh has been completely removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If there remains anything from what cannot be removed by its removal, then shave that with one of the fine instruments until nothing is left from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If blood is dominant to you, or if a hot boil occurs: then apply something against it as required: or it's from malignant boils, then proceed with cautery on it, until the blood is removed and all tissues are removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then, after making an incision, apply vinegar, water, or wine to the nose.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then you will know that he/she/it is already healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If instead the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that within him/her/it is newly formed flesh in the upper parts of the nose bones, to which penetration does not reach with an incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary that you insert a thread with some thickness, and knots in it many nodes. And place between every node the quantity of a finger or less: and let the invalid put one end of this thread into his/her nose with a stick, or as he/she can do after performing it like the same awer: and he/she pulls out its smell until it reaches up to the nose cavity and comes out above the throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And indeed, many times young boys do something similar to this Attom, in schools: and it is a simple thing for him who wishes.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which comes out above the nose, and the other which remains in the nostril.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then sharpen the knife with the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that there is flesh already attached to the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then extract the thread: and put on the nose after blood withdrawal the licor that you saturated with the Egyptian ointment: do this for three days or longer until the balm impregnates all that is left from the tissues.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place a lead pipe at the end of the thing in the nose for a few days until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however there is a treatment that dries out, use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the purpose of washing the head, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, do this using something made of silver or metal: it should be similar to a lamp wick, open like a shell, and its opening should be similarly shaped.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed pipe, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the tool for washing the head should be full, found: it should have a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat it in oil or whatever else you wish from juices and liquid substances.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the tool.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	¶ On treating the inflammation of the nose.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Thelul often appears at the tip of the nose, and grows bigger and increases over days until its appearance becomes unpleasant.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of this, it is necessary to act at the beginning of its appearance and remove all of it completely.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place over the site, or a cautery, or a burning medicine that stays in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore its incision is delayed until it grows larger, then consider whether there are stones, hard ones, of a yellowish color, that have few sensations. Then do not touch this with iron, because it produces an inflamed sore.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have seen many times when someone is struck by a boil and great mischief befalls him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the boil has a soft touch and is not of yellow color, and you see that an incision can possibly be made throughout it, then treat the patient, and cut out the boil without fear, without trembling: and care for the place with whatever dries and binds it until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On suturing the nose, the lips, and the ears.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when dissolution of continuity occurs within one of these cartilages, there is little need for operation, unless in certain individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something occurs to someone from that, you should consider if there is a recent wound with its blood: and then join the two wounds together with stitches. Afterwards, care for them until they heal.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the continuity of dissolution of the lips has already been separated and each part is now healthy, then it must be that you remove all visible parts from its skin until bleeding occurs.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Next, join the two lips together with stitches and tighten them, then apply powdered dragon's blood and ground frankincense over it. Place a piece of powdered plaster on top of this, along with pieces from another kind of consolidating plaster: and release the bound person for untie after two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Next, release the patient and change the medicine: and let him go until the stitches fall out on their own.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the person with ointment until they heal.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is to join the continuity or with needles, as we told you in abdominal suturing. Or to join the dissolution with thread, as I taught you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the Extraction of Nodules from the Lips.
Caput XXVII.	Head 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	To many people, similar hard swellings to seeds of herbs often occur inside their lips: some are smaller and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, you must turn the lip inside out, and cut over every lump of it, and hang it up with a hook, and puncture it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with a paste until blood is drained out.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then wash it with vinegar and cleanse the area with it until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On cutting into the flesh born on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Head 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often flesh grows on the gum, which the ancients call an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, you should hang it up with a hook: or hold it with forceps and puncture it at its root, allowing pus to flow out, or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on the paste or other止血 powders that have been ground and dried over the area.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If the same flesh returns after healing, for it does return many times, then cut into it a second time and cauterize it: for this part will not return after being cauterized.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the reason of Teeth with Iron.
Caput XXIX.	Head 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes, in the surfaces of teeth from inside and outside parts, and between gums, there are rough, filthy layers, which sometimes decay, turning yellow and green until corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through that.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you must have the sick person sit between your hands, and their head on your breast. And scrape the lump and tooth in which you see layers, resembling sand: until nothing remains from it. Similarly with darkness, greenness, yellowing, and others until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	Therefore, if what is from the beginning of reason is taken away from them, it is good: and if not, then another round of reasoning will be applied to them on the next day, the second, and the third, until the very end reaches the study in that which you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that the tooth requires razors of different shapes and various figures: according to how you prepare for your operation. Therefore, the razor used to remove the tooth from the lower part is different from the one used to remove the teeth between them, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And let those razors of these forms, which you see, be prepared for you.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	¶ On the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	Head 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You must cure the tooth of its pain with all your skills and be patient in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing that can replace it when it is extracted: because it is a noble substance; until then, once there is no excuse for the extraction of its tooth, then it must be made by the patient to extract itself, so that the painful tooth is solidified and certified as such by you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Indeed, the patient often deceives himself with pain and thinks there is something wrong with his tooth, and removes it. Then the pain does not subside until the painful tooth has been extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have already seen that from the practice of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore you yourself verify that the tooth is painful, then you should incise around the tooth with a bistort (a type of tool), where there exists something of effectiveness, until the gum discharges from every part: and afterwards move it with your fingers, or with fine tongs first gradually, until you crush it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then you should then place large forceps with good location and the head of the patient between your knees: which you have already held well so that it does not move; and then pull the tooth according to its straightness, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If however it does not come out, then take one of those tools and insert it under him from every part with ease, and try its movement, as you did initially.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth has been perforated or corroded, then you should fill that hole with a cloth and bind it together with the end of a thin rod so as not to break it during your tightening when using forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And you should carefully perform the incision around the gum area from every part many times.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength, so as not to break it, and let a part of it remain, and heal over the patient from that sickness which was causing him more pain initially.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, do not do what the ignorant bloodletters do during their procedure and due to their rashness above removing him, aside from giving them what we have narrated.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Indeed, they often cause great illnesses in men which are harder to break, and let all of his roots remain or some of them; or they remove him with some of the bones of the jaw: as we have testified many times this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then cleanse afterwards with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	And if bleeding occurs from the places [wounds] (for this happens many times), then rub something with myrrha and fill the area with it. If that does not work, then cauterize it if myrrha fails to stop your bleeding.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of small forceps with which the tooth is moved first, let them be long at their ends, short in their handles, thick so they do not bend when pressed against the tooth: let them be like you see the thick handles, until when you grip them, they do not bite themselves and do not bend. Let them also have short ends, and may they be made of steel or made by folding metal centrally, straight at their ends: and in their ends should be teeth whose some enter into others and are gripped with a fitting constriction, firmly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes they make the ends like the shape of a bird's beak which is called a stork, and there is a strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	¶ On the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	Title 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains at the site of tooth extraction that has been broken off, then it is necessary to place a bit of butter on the spot for one or two days until the area softens. Then insert with vinegar or forceps, whose ends resemble the beak of a bird called the stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The shape of this is that of forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their ends should be made like a file, or like an almond.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	And if these forceps do not yield to you for extraction, then it is necessary that you burn over the root and remove all the flesh, and insert an implement which is called a slender lever whose form is as follows.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Make the briefness of the extremity small, moderately thick: and do not make it damp, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root exits through that, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with these tools when there are forms such as these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangular extremity, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the thin triangular extremity.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	And also assist with this tool which has two branches, and this is its form.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other tools and implements that precede it according to the number of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	And also be assistance with this tool that resembles a large curved hook, of this form, with a twisted triangular extremity in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break; and let it not be damp.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many instruments for teeth: and similarly, other tools are not counted. And the skilled craftsman, with his skillful craft, finds an instrument by himself according to what their operation and difficulties signify to them.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because there are from the complexities for which the old did not mention an instrument due to the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If however the mouth breaks from the jawbone, or from other bones of the mouth, or it rots: then examine it over its location with whatever tool and hook that fits for it from the instruments and hooks which I mentioned in extraction of roots, and assist with gestures, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be some thickness in it gradually, so that it can be tightened or held by the mouth with it and does not escape or leak until the mouth exits. And restore the location with medicines suitable for this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then cut it off from its own putrefaction and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the lock of outstanding teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Head 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth that are outstanding do not follow their natural course, a foul thing arises through this form: and especially when it happens among women and girls, namely venals.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you should consider this.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	Therefore, you must consider this. For if a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit, or if its lock (serratura) and shaping are impossible: then extract it. And if it is attached to another tooth, then strike it along with this tool whose form is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a sharp, thin pointed face made from iron, with its very pointed ends.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cutting tool be such that when you strike it many days, and because of the hardness of teeth, and so as not to disturb another from teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however it is displayed above its own grinding tool: then grind that with a grinding tool made of iron, whose form is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be entirely made of iron, and its handle finely punctured like a needle with the kind of tool that is used to make needles. With this instrument, the tooth will be gradually ground over many days in a manner that does not disturb the tooth and cause it to fall: then soften it afterwards, and finish by cutting it with certain razors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If a tooth is broken from which a part breaks and injures the tongue: then you must also grind that tooth until all roughness of that break is removed and it is leveled. And smoothed so as not to injure the tongue or corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the retention of teeth with golden threads.
Caput XXXIII.	Head 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When there is shaking and disturbance in the front teeth due to impact or accident, and it's not possible for the patient to hold back what they eat so that it doesn't fall out; and when treatment with止血 medicines does not help: then genius (or capability) exists within them to be held together with golden threads. Because silver turns green and decays after days; but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be of moderate thickness and coarseness according to quantity that it might fit between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	Indeed, the form of retention is as follows: take a thread and introduce its double between two healthy teeth. Then weave with both ends of the thread through the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the weaving to another healthy tooth.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving until you reach the part from which you began. And hold your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is not removed completely; and let the tightness of your hand when holding the thread at the roots of the teeth not allow it to escape.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with forceps; and join both together, and hold them while you move; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moving tooth so as not to harm the tongue; then release them as tightly as possible while it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however they break or slip, tie them with another thread and it will stand with him for the entire duration.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth and the figure of retention for two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their original places after an accident, and they are held just as we have described, and remain. And this does not happen unless it is by the hand of a skilled, prudent, and experienced artisan.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes it is made from some of the metallic bones: and it is done as the shape of a tooth, and it is placed in its place, so that the tooth is protected and tied, just like we said: and it remains and serves him for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the operation on the ligament that occurs under the tongue, which impedes speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this particular ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, being present from birth in humans, or accidental, due to an injury that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	The operation on it involves opening the mouth of the sick person from his forehead to your chest and lifting their tongue. Then you cut that nerve ligament across its width until the tongue is released from its constriction.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is any hardness or knot due to the healing of wounds within it, and if this comes from the consolidation of injuries: then produce a hook in that thing, and cut through its width until you hit the ligament, and dissolve the knot.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, so that there is not a deep tear in the flesh and you cut into an artery, causing blood to flow.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then after that, wash the area around the cut with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a linen strip that the patient must keep overnight, so it doesn't harden in two.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If blood does flow out, then put over the area some ground substances.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If however blood seizes you, then cauterize the area with a light-colored cauterizer which is suitable for this: afterwards take care of it along with other treatments until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the Extraction of the Ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Title XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	At times, an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a toad, hindering the tongue from its natural function and possibly becomes so large as to fill the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation with it is, that you open the mouth of the sick before the sun: and consider the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it of yellowish color, or black, hard, and the sick does not feel it: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is turning towards whiteness, where there is moisture, then produce a hook into it and fall upon it with a thin lancet, and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood seeps out when you are operating during your time, then place over it pounded garlic until the blood is withdrawn. Then return to your operation until you extract it with its completion.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then wash it with vinegar and salt: and treat it for the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the treatment of two tonsil abscesses.
Caput XXXVI.	Title XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	At times they occur between the throat and gland, which resemble cotton wool glands that appear behind: and are named two tonsils; which when treated as we said in division, and if they do not heal, then you should examine them.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore it is an abscess that is hard, yellow in coloration, and has few sensations: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is red in color and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing blood discharge, indeed release it until it ripens.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will perforate him: or it will be torn through itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is fine: then you must penetrate him.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation upon him is as follows, which you should consider before her own surgery. If he has pus of heat and calm completion, or if it is reduced by some diminution: then indeed make him sit in the presence of the sun, and his head rests in your bosom; open his mouth, and receive with both hands serving him, and press his tongue below with this instrument, which has this form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver or copper, as fine as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you then press it with your tongue and the pus becomes visible to you, and falls upon your own hand: then take a hook and attach him to his tonsil, and pull out as much of it as possible towards the outside, leaving behind some from within the clothing.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with the tool using this form which follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is assimilated by chisels, but its ends should be rounded so that each of the openings of the ears is directly sharp to the other; hence care must be taken that it is made of red-hot iron or saturated with oil.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this tool is not present, then cut it with a filet, which has this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp at one end and not sharp at the other end.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to the same form of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incisions, the sick person should gargle with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If bleeding occurs to him, he should gargle with water in which the pebbles of granatum have been boiled, or leaves of myrtle, and similar items from astringents, until the blood flow stops. Then care for it until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes ulcers occur in the throat elsewhere, other than the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, do as I instructed for the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And indeed, I have already treated a woman with an ulcer that was born between her throat and was turning black, reducing her senses, which had almost closed her throat. The woman was breathing from tightly constricted airways, and she was no longer able to take fluid or water. If she had remained for one more day, or two days, she would have perished.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the ulcer only rose to the extent that it emitted two branches, until they reached beyond two nasal openings.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	So I acted quickly and fixed one of them with a hook.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then cut it off where you can grasp it from the nasal opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did to her what was left that came out from the other nasal opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue: afterwards, I fixed a hook in the ulcer. Then I cut off part of it, and only little blood flowed out from it afterwards. Thus, the woman's throat was restored, and she immediately began to drink water, then started eating food again.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore, I did not stop repeatedly penetrating the same ulcer for a long period of time. The ulcer occurred in place where I was cutting, until it had grown excessively and reached that point.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore, skillfully and with cautery, excise the boil between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	So it stood after the addition: then I walked from part to part, and did not know what God had done with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	¶ On making an incision for pus in the wrist.
Caput XXXVII.	Head 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the discharge descends to the wrist, and pus is formed, and it is long, then it is named perpendicular. And if there is a large, round swelling at the lower part, then that is called 'uua'.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we said about division, and the treatment does not adhere: then you will see that the warm pus has left from it, and it is thin: in this case it must be cut open.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And if there is a round aggregation from it, and does not have its length, and it is bloody, or of a yellowish, or black color, and does not have any sensation: in this case it must be given an appropriate cut to the operation for it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For there is fear over the weak one.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I said from whiteness and its length, that you have the weak one seated near the sun: and press his tongue with the tool, as was mentioned beforehand. Then attach a hook in the wrist and pull it downwards: then cut it with one or two of the tools I said for cutting two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you must cut from it only what is added above the natural boundary without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut more from there, you will injure speech and language.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the cut, use what we have described for cutting two tonsils: and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however, the sick person is frightened by the cut: then it must be that you use your skill in cauterizing him without fear and without dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the measure of cauterization in that is not, unless with sharp water: and it is, that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the tool we said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Next, receive the water I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and with it apply heat to the unextinguished sole of the foot, not thick or too thin, filling this tool's cavity with it, which has this shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the end of his extremity on which medicine is applied have a cavity, as the cavity of the cochlear radius does.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the tool with medicine over any one of them: and let the sick person lie on his side so that saliva from his mouth can flow out due to the intrinsic medicine, so nothing descends from it into the throat of him and injures him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	And hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you should apply the first of that amount for half an hour, until you notice it has already been weakened and calmed by the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take the root and enclose it over the radius extremity, and pour the root with medicine, and insert the root with the tool upwards into the tube until the root adheres to any part.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times, until you achieve what you desire for cauterizing the useful one.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then release it: indeed, it rises and falls after three days or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to walk your medicine, do this repetition: and after cauterization, cleanse with the tip of a cone dipped in butter, and clean with what is there in its surroundings from the medicine: and wash it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it is treated externally with ointments, and rinsed internally with gargles, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	So this is the nature of this kind of treatment - it is healthier and more prolonged due to the fear associated with the operation.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes it is treated with an instrument even finer than the cauterizer and scalpel: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take a pungent reed and hyssop, and origanum (oregano), and rue, and saffron, and chamomile, and dandelion, and similar herbs. Gather all these together or some of them in a pot, and immerse it with vinegar, and boil it. Let the pot be well rinsed out with a little sediment. In the middle of the pot make an opening through which the conical instrument is to be placed according to this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Make it out of silver or copper; and insert the end that has a small opening into the mouth of the patient until the steam rises up to the instrument above the tube, until the tube becomes darkened much.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat this several times over her until she recovers.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of spring when the season changes.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	Moreover, it adds to springtime: and you should not do that unless at the declination of spring when it is warm.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and compose its bark in the end of it such that the mouth does not get burned: because the bark of the rue prevents the steam from burning the mouth; and this is from good treatment with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the removal of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Head 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many times it adheres in the throat, whether it be bone or a fish spine, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, you must extract what is above that which falls under the use of an instrument on your tongue, after pressing your tongue with the tool towards the sun, and you will then know what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And if what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must let the sick man eat first before food begins to be processed in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps therefore, what is attached will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the sick person may swallow a fragment of the nap, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a small piece of dry bread: or he may take a fragment of dried marine sponge: and then he should swallow it, tying it with a string afterwards.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	And when it has reached the place where the thorns or bone is, and they are extracted, then it will come out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	And if therefore it does not come out with what we said: then use this tool of lead according to this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a finger slightly, and at the end of it have a curvature, which he inserts into his throat with ease: and himself hold its head up raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, so that he does not have a cough and push the bone or spine out with it, or if needed, insert the doctor's hand itself.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But if the sick person inserts it, this is better: because of their knowledge about the location of what is attached: and push downwards or while holding his hand with the tool upwards, the entire thing according to its quantity which is prepared for him until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the Extraction of the Bloodworm.
Caput XXXIX.	Title XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When treating a bloodworm with what I said in the division of treatment alongside medicines, and if it doesn't respond, then consider doing this procedure in front of the patient's throat under sunlight, or after pressing their tongue with the tool I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your blow falls upon the bloodworm, extract it with a small hook or with slightly curved finer tools.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	But if it is not possible with them: then take a concave tube and insert it into the patient's throat up to near the throat. Then insert the heated iron part of the tube with fire inside it.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Perform this action many times, and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him receive the treated water, cold, and open his mouth with it: and he should mix his mouth with it without swallowing anything from it; and he shall move the water once an hour after another using his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	Indeed, the bloodworm falls off when it senses the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If however it does not come off with what we have told you, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs or with a wing using the tool we described for fumigating a snail.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Perform this action many times, because it will eventually fall off.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	The method of operation during fumigation is as follows: take a pot in which there are live coals with fire: and the pot should be covered with a cover, having a hole in its center: and the end of the tool is composed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then release the fumigation, and let the patient place his mouth at the end of the tube, closing his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the bloodworm.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the blood sucker falls immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	And if it does not fall, then try the multiple repetitions of the steam bathing.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the patient can bear thirst, and eat salty food, and herbs, and does not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore, it is necessary for him to leave with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the tool used to extract the blood sucker from the throat when it falls upon it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to tongs, like you see: unless there is this kind of curvature that enters the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the beak of a bird called the stork, in which there is the roughness of an emery wheel: when it grips something, it does not release itself entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	¶ On the incision of abscesses, and their sectioning, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	The species of abscesses are many, of various kinds, according to how their memory is brought back, namely one and this one in this book: they differ in penetration of them and in the sectioning of themselves by two methods.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One is from the species of abscesses within itself, and that which it contains due to humidity.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is because of places where it occurs from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an abscess occurring in the head is another from an abscess occurrence in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place, is another from an abscess occurrence at joints: and each of them has its own judgment according to their operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And among abscesses are those that should not be punctured until after the maturation of the healing in them and its completion: and from these there are those that should be punctured while they are raw and do not mature according to completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like excrescences which are close to stitches.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because when an abscess occurs near the stitches and extends to its point of origin until decay sets in around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves might be affected by the operation. This is why that member experiences a closer degree of contraction.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or if an abscess occurs on the main member: because if you delay incising it until it matures, it may harm either him or through that main part of the body.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or if it's near the anus, then puncture the immature one: and there is no need to incise an abscess that is raw, incompletely digested, except when it's near the anus so that it doesn't putrefy deeply and spread into the inner parts of the anus, causing a fistula or result in a terminal stage that won't heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You should know the time for perforating an abscess when it has matured according to completion: and this can be observed at the suppression of pain, the subsidence of fever, the fading of redness, and diminishment in pulse, and sharpness of headache of the abscess: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same perforation below the abscess and at its more prominent parts. And let the perforation go through longitudinally in the body if the abscesses are located in hand and foot regions, cutaneous lesions, cords, nerves, arteries, and finally in all equal locations where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those that reflect, make the incision following that part of the body.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	But when the abscess is in fatty areas: then it's better to allow digestion of its contents until confirmation, as we said according to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you pierce it before that, the course of the poison proceeds from there, and there are many ulcers and suppuration, and perhaps the lips become hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some stumps are pierced according to the width of the body for necessity: or according to where the part needs it.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And you should administer a small incision for small blisters and a large incision for large blisters: or many sections similar to the size of the blisters.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are blisters where it is necessary for the skin to be concave: and one strikes when it has already become like a patch, and finished at a point that is already dead: as what happens in many cases, such as pus and boils.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And among them are those that are cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from them is derived the manner of incision as if it were shaped like a leaf of myrtle.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As for the groin blister.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among them are those where a circular cut and a crescent-shaped cut (lunar section) is administered, and similar ones from cuts.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	But for those that do not have a head, such as the shallow superficial blisters, it is necessary to pierce them with a superficial or merely flat incision.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when there is a large blister that has already accumulated much pus, it must be pierced so that you do not overdo it and remove all the pus at once. Instead, extract some of it from within itself.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then soak the blister until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some more from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Perform this procedure multiple times according to the scale until all is released out. Especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man who is decrepit: for with each discharge of pus, the animal spirit is resolved from the animal many times. And perhaps the sick person dies and you do not notice it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, take this chapter as a major caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, at the point through which you have perforated, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound from the needle is small, or there is a flat cut, then administer flax oil, or old tallow.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is a large abscess and many perforation裂缝 are present, then you should introduce flax oil into all the cracks until it reaches the inner part.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you cut off a part of the skin in the abscess, or hollowed it out: then it is necessary to fill it with old tallow, or as when weaving cloth, or after pulling out wool from flax without moisture: and tie it up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then release him, and care for that which needs to be done with the balm until he is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	And if there happens to be bleeding during your time of operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after soaking the cloth in them: and place it over the bleeding area multiple times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	And if bleeding persisted, then it is necessary to administer a regimen and care, as well as powders which I have narrated in many places of this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	And if it is during winter and the area of the abscess contains many nerves, then you should pour on powders mixed with wine and warm oil, and place them over the areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is during summer and the areas are fatty, then you should place powders that have been soaked in water and oil, or use them with wine and oil, and make all of that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Once when it will be the third day, as we said before, then you must remove the pustule, and cleanse it, and administer to its care what is suitable for it until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from knowledge of the general treatment of pustules.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the second part of the division, I have already spoken about every pustule, how the way for its particular single treatment is described in a chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Section on pustules that occur on the head skin.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small pustules occur on the head skin, and they are from nodum species which contain coats that are their sacks: as if they were swollen chickens.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their kinds are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	They are of various kinds: some of them are fatty; and from them there are those that contain a moisture similar to mud; and from them there are those that contain a moisture similar to froth and curd: they are like these, and among them there are those which are stone-like hard.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And when it comes to the section of all and their removal, there is no fear since at their section, an artery does not oppose in a contrary manner.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	The procedure for their section is to experience it with the tool that comes after this, which is named the Intrusive Instrument, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if that which contains moisture is the case, then when it is cut during its section along its length, it should be cut superficially: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the cut from line b to line g. As soon as moisture is drained away, then scrape off the lump that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything behind on it completely.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For many times it returns, if anything remains from that.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the wound in Egyptian balm if it is present; and if not, in water and salt: and fill it with this, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will decay what remains of the infection.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then spread the Egyptian balm over it twice more, and three times, and if you lack that, until you are sure there is nothing left from the infection. Then treat the wound with the balm until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	And if it contains a fat lump: then cut it according to this shape, having the form of a cross-section: and remove the corners between the sections, and scrape it from every part: and try your skill in extracting the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	And if an artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you next.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do with the boil if it contains stones, from the section and treatment being the same, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And cutting through the boil containing stones is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain boils located on the head in some people, in which there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	This is what happened: for I cut above the boil on an old woman's head and found a boil like a hard, solid stone, rough, white, which could not be split. And whoever struck it while trying to remove it would wound himself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But in other boils that occur on the head, apart from these specific boils that happen on children's heads and at the base of the ears, the sectioning of all such boils should be superficial.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Simply make a puncture always from the lower part of them, so that the course of healing may move downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for it along with what is suitable for their healing process.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	¶ On sectioning the Strobilus in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses occur frequently in the neck, under the axilla, and groin; and sometimes they occur elsewhere in the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And concerning those that occur among them in the neck, there is one and many of them: they are generated by each other; and every Strobilus is within its own proper membrane as it is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the forms of these Strobiluses are numerous.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And among them are stony ones: and among them are those that contain moisture: and among them are malevolent ones, which do not respond to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In the one among them that you see with good disposition in touch, whose manifest characteristic is near to the color of skin, and it moves throughout all parts, and it is not attached with neck nerves, nor with muscles, nor with artery, nor it is deep: it must be removed by sectioning superficially from the superior part to the inferior body part along a line, b. to line g., and remove it from every side: and extend two skin flaps with a scalpel, or with multi-bladed scalpels if needed, as we have mentioned in head abscesses and outside of it, remove it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And above all caution, do not hit the vein or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the knife not be too sharp: so as not to injure your own hand with the cut, or disturb the patient, and hit something that is unnecessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you come upon a vein, or an artery, or there's an obstacle to the operation, then place in the wound a powdered substance, or certain powders that disperse blood, and tighten the wound, and remove it until the pain of antiseptic subsides and the wound softens: or it may begin to desire putrefaction.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	The blood is removed by suction, therefore proceed with your operation until completion.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Next, with your finger, check if there's anything left from the Strophula in other corresponding parts: therefore cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein in the root of the Strophula: then you must not cut that Strophula from its root. Rather, you should tie it with a doubled strong thread and let it go until it falls by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with the old cote, which you have already prepared in the Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole Strophula is encountered, then you must join the lips over two wounds: and then immediately cut it off as soon as you see that there's no excess left.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If however you see that the excess remains due to the size of the Strophula, then you must proceed with cutting its root and removing it: and administer the suture which we said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And that which contains moisture from the Strophula, puncture it with a superficial incision: so you will see its maturation site: and place the puncture below the part of the body following this, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the puncture, licorium with ointment and similar remedies, so it may heal what remains from corruption, until you see that the wound has already been cleansed. Then care for it with regenerative flesh ointments, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	The section on the division of the epiglottis in the case of an asp bite occurring within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Title XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	They said that the ancients made this incision in the epiglottis, and no one has been seen in our land who performs it: and here is the written account of their language.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	When they have a synanche (a condition), the division of the epiglottis must be done: because nothing improves through this method: for all veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a warm pustule in the mouth, or throat, or in both tonsils, when there is no discomfort in the passages, it must use the division of the epiglottis, to avoid the destruction that comes from pre-ignition.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we make that (referring to a previous procedure or condition), we must divide the epiglottis under three circles of the epiglottis, or four, with a small cut across its width, in the area between two circles, such that it is a cut in the sifacum (a type of tissue layer) and not in the cartilage: and indeed, this location is suitable for division as it is free from flesh and the blood vessels are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then he should spread the throat skin with an instrument called an uncus (a kind of hook).
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should find the skin until he reaches the passage (the canal): if he sees anything from there, it is necessary to divide the blood vessels.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he cuts the sifacum (the mucous membrane) as we have described: and it is indicated after the division of the canal from the phlegm that comes out of there, with what breaks off, and the removal of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And after a certain period, open the wound.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	And when the hour comes to fear the pre-heating, join two lips of the wound on the skin, and take out only that part itself without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer the medicines which cause flesh to be born (or: generate), until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis said.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this discourse that we have narrated is an explanation only when one sees that a certain amount of these medicines has been swallowed by the sick person: and the sick man rises above death and wants to be cut with his breathing: they go to the second epiglottis, so that the sick man breathes over the wound site with some respiration, and is saved from death: for this reason they commanded to leave the open wound until the malice of illness is consumed, and the malice of him is three days old, and as it were. Then therefore they ordered to bleed the wound and care for it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And this is what I have seen with my own eyes, that one maid took a knife and sent it into her throat, and struck against the part of the bronchial canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was summoned to treat her and found her groaning, as if the groan of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I then examined the wound and found that only a little blood had come out of the wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	So I concluded that she did not constrict the vein nor the artery; and the air was escaping from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore treated it, her wound and cared for it until she was well: and nothing happens to the maid except wheezing in her voice: and she returned after days to better dispositions.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	¶ On the section of the neck hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 42.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess is named Gastroceles, it is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it can occur in two ways: either naturally or accidentally.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly, in the natural case there is no defect.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	Accidentally, it occurs in two ways: one of which is like large lumps.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other method is similar to an abscess that forms from arterial pulsation.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is fear with it, and it is not necessary to presume upon it with iron unless in the part that is small. And you should test it, and investigate it with an introduction (of a tool or instrument).
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a large lump and not suspended by any vein, then cut it like lumps are cut. And extract what is contained within from the gland if there is something inside; or else examine everything of it completely.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the area with what needs to be from treatment until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	¶ On the section above the type of Lumps.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many species of lumps and I have already mentioned all their species in the division. And it is necessary that I mention here the differentiation between a lump and an exit (or protrusion), which causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore that when an exit (or protrusion) is a warmth and fever, and severe pains until the overflow stops and the corruption is completed; then indeed the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When the knot does not have warmth, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains them inside like a sack which is their own proper organ, and its color matches the body's color: and they begin like chickpeas, and develop as lentils, both larger and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they come in two kinds: either they become fatty; or they retain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	The colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	So when you come to the treatment of the Node, you must examine it, and first inquire about it with a tool called an Intromissum, according to how its form will be described in the chapter that follows this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of investigating the question and all nodes is, you should take this tool, and introduce it into the moist area that you find in the node: then move your fingers with it gradually until you know that the tool has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then place your last finger according to the size of the node.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	And then remove the tool (Intromissum), and examine what comes out in investigation of it.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If moisture flows out, regardless of its color: then dry it off with a superficial cut, as I said in the other nodes.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture comes out in the investigation of the Intromissum, then you will know that it is fatty. Dry it off with a section having a form like a cross, according to this shape as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and scrape off the skin from all sides easily: and if possible keep the sac over it so that you can extract both of them (the lump and the affected area) healed together.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If indeed it is broken by the pincers during surgery, and it's not possible to extract it intact, since this happens quite often, then quickly remove that fragment until nothing remains from it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if there remains even a little bit, or much, the Knot according to most returns (for treatment).
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And if it binds you and leaves a little bit: then fill the wound at your completion with some corroding and sharp powders: and pinch the wound, and put above it what sits an warm pustule, and care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	And if therefore it is a large Knot, then cut two of its lips, and care for it with what makes flesh.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however it is against you a pulsating vein, or not pulsating: then press forward, and fill the place with a small amount of sand ground finely, and let that tightly bound thing rest for two days, or three, until the wound rots and stops bubbling: then return to apply to what remains from the Knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	¶ Concerning external instruments for sectioning and perforation.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Among these there are forms of introducers, and they consist of three species.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For among them is the large one, and from them is the medium, and from them is the small.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of iron with square ends that taper inwardly, so they facilitate entry into the pustule.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Experimenters, and no, that is, perforators: and one of them is named burin, that is, perforating. And there are three species of it.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	From these, there is a large one, and a medium-sized one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They agree that they should investigate through the stumps, discharges, and sinuses, as well as swellings, from what is between them in relation to the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And for others, they are made round, smooth, and soft, like large needles to which felts are attached. These might be made from yellow metal, or air, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those that are made from yellow metal.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And even experience is gained with the use of black lead, which fits to test for sinuses whose concavities are reflections, so that they might be observed in relation to their own reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three types of these.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because from them there is a long one, and a medium one, and a short one, according to the size of the opening and constriction of the sinus.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of scissors, and there are many types of them.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because from them there are simple ones, that have a single curvature. And there are three types as you see: Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them there are Blind Scissors: and there are three kinds of these.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them there are Scissors with two curves, and there are three kinds of these. And from them there are Scissors with three curves, and there are also three types of these. All these are necessary in their respective places.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	These are the forms of Scalpels, which are used for cutting and scraping Nodes and stumps: and there are three types of these. Since from them there is a large one, a medium-sized one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	The ends that undergo section are sharp; other ends are not sharp. They are not placed like this unless they serve for the benefit of removal during fear of incision in Nodules, or of a vein: and through them, the sick is healed, and finds temporary peace somewhat akin to what he encounters at excoriation by charring.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Magdeburg and they belong to three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made from air and resemble Radium with which alcohol is produced. In the broad end, a hidden point of the spatulum is located; in this, it flows into both internal and external parts when desired, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of the spatulum that is hidden between the fingers during excision by charring: and these are not felt by the sick. There are three species, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of the Windlasses with which blood flow is cut off: and there are three species, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of air or lemon, round, somewhat according to their length as you see, and let them be for subtlety.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these species of Windlasses be large and small with you: so that you may cut off blood at speed according to necessity, and then when there is no medicine present for you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you do not use them in the cutting off of blood everywhere on the body, and you use them only in fatty areas: like behind the legs, and thighs, and behind the arms, and breasts, and belly, and groin, and similar places, from fatty lumps, moist ones.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they make small instruments similar to chopsticks' blades out of them, according to their shape. These are used to cut blood when it flows from the phlebotomy site, or near a vein incision, or an artery. And sometimes they make round ones according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the care of human breasts which resemble those of women.
Caput XLVII.	Head 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes, the breasts of certain humans swell during the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to wet themselves at night), until they resemble a woman's breasts: and they remain ugly deformations.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	So, whoever dislikes this condition, they must shave over the breasts in a lunar section according to this form from line b. to line g. Then scrape off all the fatty tissue.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the incision with ointment from cooked medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then stitch together the two flaps of skin over the wound and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If the breast droops downwards and softens due to its size, as it happens in women: then it must be cut in two sides at their upper parts with two similar cuts of the lunar form, where each is contained by the other at both ends until a larger line contains the smaller one, according to this form from line b. to line g. Then scrape off the skin which is between the two flaps and remove the fatty tissue, and administer what we have said about stitches and powders that are necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If you do not make the cut required for it, due to the discomfort of the patient or because of blood discharge: then you must fill the wound with a submerged cayenne pepper ointment and release it until that which remains from the fatty tissue is corroded.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the puncturing of deformities, which happens under the scrotum.
Caput XLVIII.	Title XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These discharges that occur under the titillating (a medical term referring to certain symptoms) are from species of Strophularia which contain cysts, and among these are those that contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	As for those among them that contain moisture, they should be cut longitudinally at the lunar section, according to this shape, from line b. to line g. Therefore, when everything within the discharge is evacuated through the meatus (urinary opening), then fill it up with a new dressing and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the dressing is removed, and it is treated with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	And if the discharge is from the species of Strophularia nodules, then cut above it as we said in the division above for Strophulas.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if the wound extends to this extent and expels pus, then apply a cautery to it, as we said in what was mentioned previously.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	§ On the topic of dividing discharges that occur due to an artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Title XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes consolidated, it often leads to a discharge: similarly, when a vein too becomes affected, leading to a discharge and swelling.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which one can recognize that a discharge and swelling is due to an artery or vein are as follows: because when it's due to an artery, the discharge is long and accumulates deep in the body; and when you press on the discharge with your fingers, you feel as if there is a rattling sound within it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which occurs due to a vein is round and prominent on the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And section above this pustule is an error, and particularly one located under the axilla, groin, neck, and many other body areas: it is very considerable.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, its care should be properly regulated with iron, and that which is also present in the extremities or at the head, must also be properly regulated.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, regarding what is derived from them due to the expansion of the artery opening, find it in the skin section in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with tongs, afterwards the artery: and free it from tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Next insert the point under it and make her penetrate up to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, according to what I taught you in removing two arteries that are in the vessels.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then puncture the place which is between the two ligaments with pus, until all the blood contained within comes out, and allow the pustule to drain.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply the treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall off. Afterwards, care for it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is a pustule due to the cutting of a vein, then you must hold your hand with what is possible from under the pustule with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the point under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate. And there should be a double thread until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie it with the pustule's good ligament: according to what I told you about the urinary ligament, tie it from both parts with its two ends.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If you feel that the thread is to be removed, then insert another needle with a different thread completely at the incision site: press and tighten your thread in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in its center until when what is inside comes out: then cut away excess skin and release what was tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place over it the wool you have preserved in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment that is done with ointments and unguents until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	For the abscess that occurs due to the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Head L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in an artery and vein, similarly an abscess can occur in nerves: it happens due to a blow or results from excessive effort, and similar causes. And they often occur in auxiliary areas, heels, and in any place where joints move. It is a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body and it can be found in many positions without causing pain. And when it is tightened with congestion, it feels like a fainting sickness within him.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an abscess gathered deep within the body, rather it's under the skin and it can move to any part of the body, and it doesn't extend forward or backward.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, that which occurs at joints should not be penetrated with a tool.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps there will occur contraction, though.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that case, for what occurs at the head or on the forehead, skin it with a small incision.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If thus it is an abscess of few threads, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and incise it. Afterwards remove it, and attach the wound to with stitches: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	¶ On the excision of appendices, which happens in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Title LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	There occur in some people, many times in their abdomens and in other parts of their bodies, what are called fungi, which resemble mushrooms due to their similarity with them.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is subtle, and whose head is large, and the lips of which turn.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it comes out in small amounts: and there is from them something that greatly increases.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed, I have seen a man, and in his abdomen there were two fungi, which resembled mushrooms more than other things: there was no difference between them, the whitish, small roots, and their lips turned inward, they could be found, and moisture always flowed out of them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I therefore dealt with these, and found them to weigh almost X and VIII ounces in one, and about VI ounces in the other. The operation is performed through the incision of them, which you will then consider. If it is sickly wet, and the color of the fungi is white, wet, having a subtle root: then cut it out with a wide spatula, and ensure there is presence of cauterization with fire before your eyes.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For much blood is expelled during its excision many times: therefore, if blood overcomes you, then apply cauterization to it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	And if you see it weakened, frightened, and timid during the incision with iron, then take a wire made from lead that is twisted in the center, and apply it tightly using an athel (a type of medical tool). The method is as we have described, and release it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add in the fusion of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease to bind the lead, whenever it is pressed into wax, until it is cut off, and falls of itself without labor.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the wax is of considerable thickness on the root, then there is something to be feared and to be taken care of: especially what is inside the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible that you may hit its middle part.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it to ensure that it does not escape.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And be careful not to mistake the wax that is of a yellowish color, with few sensory qualities and an unpleasant appearance; for this is a cancerous abscess: and I will speak about it in memory of Cancer later.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Section on the care of the navel region.
Caput LII.	Chapter LI.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The navel prominence arises from various causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or it arises from cuts on the belly which are above the stomach, and issues forth through a wound in the belly or intestine according to where it occurs at other sites of rupture.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows from the vein or artery as was previously mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from constriction of the windpipe within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If it arises due to a cut in the siphon and discharges pus: then its color is similar to that of the body's color: and it is soft without pain: and its various locations are apparent.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it arises due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is more distinct with what we have narrated.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears: then returns and possibly there is a sound with it: and it is greatly admired at the entrance to the bathhouse, and the effort is heavily exerted.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If it is due to humidity, it is gentle, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor do you compress or add anything.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	And if it is due to blood, then with these signs a pustule appears turning black at the root.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	And if it is due to immersed flesh: then the pustule is heavy, large, hard, and grows according to a single unit.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	And if it's due to wind, then its touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation with it is that you should then consider if the prominence of the navel is due to blood from an artery or vein, or wind. In that case, you must refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and panic, as I taught you in the chapter where I said pustules due to an artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	And if the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine or furrow: then you must advise the sick person to hold their breath and stand stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	And then, with the signs using hot wax around the entire area of the navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then advise him to be raised up between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	And then surround it with broad spatula around the area of the navel over the spot you indicated with the hot wax.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend half a pustule downwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	And then bind it tightly around with a strong thread or with a sturdy silk ligature string: and let the knot of the ligament be loose.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle segment that has been stretched out above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If however you cannot find it already captured from the ligament: then pull out the small intestine, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestines towards the abdomen. And if you find hair, then take it with a hook and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however the artery or vein is against you: then surround it with much (material or substance).
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert two strong threads into them. And insert two needles into the circumference you made around the incision in a manner of a cross, to make them penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the incision in four places above the needle: and if you wish, remove the needle, and let the area rest until the flesh becomes putrid when stretched: and it will fall off by itself: or cut it down when it becomes thin and putrid.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with what is needed from the ointment until it is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the naris or opening of the belly button is high from the flesh, or due to moisture: then it must be that you should make a concave incision in the skin, as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And remove the blood or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then take care of it with what strengthens the area.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	¶ On the care for Cancer.
Caput LIII.	Title 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken about the division of species of Cancer and how to approach its treatment with medicines. And one must beware when treating it with iron so that it does not cause an ulceration. We also spoke about generated Cancer within the body and caution in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes when there is a cancer, it can be eradicated if an opportunity arises, where possible; like the cancer in breasts or in the thigh and those similar ones found on the limbs suitable for extraction of the whole thing. Particularly when it starts small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When indeed the ancients say, and if it is large, one should not come close to it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For indeed, I was unable to heal anyone from this: nor did I see another before me who succeeded in that matter.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation when it is positioned as we said, consists of proceeding ahead and releasing the patient from black fever on several occasions.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then if you find the bloodletting (phlebotoma) filled with evident fullness, then do so.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	And afterwards prepare the patient for preparation that will precede the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then introduce into the cancer the hooks that suit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then make the incision into all parts of it together with the skin according to examination until nothing remains from its roots: and let the blood flow and do not cut it quickly but squeeze the areas and remove the thick blood with your hand or with whatever is possible there using tools.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however the thick flow of blood causes you difficulty from an arterial or venous incision, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	¶ On the Care for Hydrophobia
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 44.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have now discussed the division of types of hydrophobia, and how water aggregation occurs: and the signs of all types, and treatment with remedies.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron, it is nothing but the condition of galls alone: and it is not approached with iron in conditions of tympanic inflammation: nor in the complete condition of hyposarcosis: for that is lethal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this condition of tympanic hydroperitonium with medicines, and your treatment did not alleviate it: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the sick person has already become weakened, or there is another ailment with him besides hydroperitonium: such as if he has a cough, or a stomach issue, and similar to these: then beware not to treat him with iron: because that is fear.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a sick person overflowing with strength, there is no mere discomfort from something other than hydroperitonium: and it's not a child or an old person. In that case, the method of treatment for him would be to lift the sick standing between your hands, and have the assistant press his back with their hand towards the lower part of his chest to expel water below.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take thornspray (spatula spinosa), according to this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let there be two parts of it being sharp, long, and with the tip like that of a thornspray (spatula).
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, there must be something slight of it progressively, so that you do not pass with it until the operation reaches the intestine and harm him.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if hydroperitonium is generated from the part of the intestine, then you must extend with your incision from the navel by a quantity of three fingers, down directly to his chest above.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the generation of hydroperitonium is due to discomfort in the liver, then your incision should be on the left from the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its generation is due to the spleen, then section should be made in the right side. And it must not even be a section on that side where he wishes to lie weak, so as not to let excesses flow onto that vulnerable spot.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	And then puncture the whole skin with the instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that incision and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin, as if you are scraping it off. And let the amount that is scraped out be equal to a fingernail or roughly so.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	And then puncture and scrape until the spatula reaches the empty space; there is a place for water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument of this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: made of silver, or copper, or brass, thin and smooth. In the lower part of it there is a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two from one side and one from the other side. And the end of it is cut like the incision of a reed, as you see, there is a ring at the top end.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then immediately it descends over the tool itself. Therefore, evacuate from the water the quantity in half an hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you evacuate more than necessary from it, perhaps the patient may die by the dispersal of his animal spirits within an hour: or a stroke (syncopa) occurs which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the strength of its own force, and according to how the sick indicate their condition based on the pulse's strength and its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the tool, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	What is that, because it gets retained immediately due to the skin which retains the hole that is above the sinus: I have already narrated about it, so that you can puncture him according to this manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then try the instrument on another day, if you see that the patient can bear this one: and also extract a small amount from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that for several days without fear, and keep yourself away from error: until nothing remains in the water except a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If you worry about the patient though, and extract a large amount from the water: then take care of it with burial under hot sand, and excessive sweat in the bath and sun, waiting for immediate recovery: and take care of it with dried medicines until it is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, spleen, after the extraction of water: according to what I have narrated about this as a precursor.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Section on the care of infants born in places where their bladders have not been punctured.
Caput LV.	Title LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone among infants emerges from their mother's womb, and the head of the sheep (a metaphor for the infant) is not punctured or perforated, or if there is a narrow opening, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, one must immediately assist with the puncturing of it when it is born using a slender Spatulum tool, according to this manner.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a small thin claw made of lead in the hole and tie it. And keep it for three days or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When then he wishes to urinate, it is removed and rubbed.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then put him back again.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the spot will not allow him to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	That is, for someone with a constricted opening, it is treated with lead as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	These however, in which there is an opening not in its proper place, get injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	This is because in those who are born from them, the opening is at the end of the staff: therefore it cannot mingle with the earlier ones until they lift the staff with their own hand to the upper parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Neither does it have generation, because the semen cannot come to the womb in its proper way: and there is a very foul illness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of treatment in this case is for the sick person to lie on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the end of the staff with your left hand forcibly and cut off the head of the staff's tip from its place, as if it were a penknife cut or like cutting some root so that something midway comes out similar to the head of the staff: and let the opening fall in the middle as it should.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of the blood flow during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Indeed, it happens many times like this.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore oppose him with that which takes out the blood and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	¶ Concerning what happens to the foreskin and head of the staff, as well as corrosion, darkening, and sticking.
Caput LVI.	Title 56: The Head
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These things often happen to the staff in Albather and it is an abominable growth of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from that there is one that is malignant and another that is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, it is necessary not to leave the diseased part hanging freely, but rather attach it with a delicate hook and cut it off until you have cleaned it entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place over it anointing on the part submerged in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that with the oil afterwards, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If it's diseased and has an unpleasant color, then you must administer a cautery after making the cut on it and its margin.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If however the disease is found attached to the foreskin and not circumcised, with part of it inside the foreskin and another part outside, then you should remove the diseased part that is inside first until it has healed. Then take care of the external part afterwards: for if you treat them together at once, the foreskin may be torn.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And diseases also occur within the testicles and the dark corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to remove completely what has already become darkened and whatever wishes to decay or has already begun to decay.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply over it afterwards with honey that has already been mixed with flour from grain mills and herbs ground through a sifter.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that along with the other treatments until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If bleeding occurs, then apply the cautery along with the lunar cautery, according to this manner.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	The cautery is useful for two purposes simultaneously, namely to stop bleeding and to treat a wound when it becomes infected.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the rod becomes infected and destroys it entirely during the night: then you must insert a leaden tube into the meatus of Priapus so that the sick may lie on top of it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the case of adherence of the prepuce to the shaft of the penis however, and these kinds of adhesions do not occur unless in someone whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not necessary above it: sometimes adhesions happen due to injury or a boil: therefore, they must be scraped off with an obtuse instrument until the ligament resolves, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then one must scrape away at the head of the penis and the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is because when the prepuce is delicate, it might be pierced due to its thinness and speedily.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then, separate the prepuce and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has already been made wet with cold water, so they do not stick together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated with an astringent wine until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	¶ On the cleanliness of children and the treatment after they have made errors.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution for any kind of continence, like other wounds. However, since it comes from our operation, with our will, and its use is proper in children, it becomes necessary to mark that operation as better, and to adopt an easier way leading towards health through this action.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say then that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because they do not use it in their laws and it is only what we have learned through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is because I have found that a larger part of surgeons and bloodletters use cleanliness through circumcision with the foreskin removed, and with lancets. They also utilize hot fomentation, bind it with thread, and make cuts with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And indeed, I have tried all these methods, and found no better improvement with hooks, and suture with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For in surgery using new knives, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the foreskin has two layers of skin: perhaps then the upper layer escapes and the lower remains; one is thus forced to make an incision for the remaining layer, and pain will follow.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the surgery done through thumbs, that is, using fingers, which surgeons employ, there's no secure cut of the end of the male member: because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In circumcision though, perhaps the blade is used, and spoils your operation: and indeed, children's skin nature is short, and often they're born like that, so they don't need circumcision: and I've seen this already.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	Circumcision using hooks and suturing with thread has given me a good experience: because the hooks are proportional to the cut: therefore, the sharpness above is as the sharpness below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportional, and they occur simultaneously for one operation at a time: and there is compression like a figure, containing the stick of skin from all parts, with no total error.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	The proper method of the operation is such that you should make it known, especially for children among those who understand a little bit more than others, that unless you tie the thread just to the stick and let it go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Next, make him rejoice and be fully happy about this, according to what your understanding receives.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then have him stand between your outstretched hands at the height of his own body, and do not let him sit. Conceal the instruments either in your袖子 or under your foot, so that the child sees none of them, nor any part of the tools.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand to the middle of his member, and blow into the skin, and pull it upwards until the tip of the member emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse her from what is collected in that filth.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Next, bind below it similarly to that one according to its size.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligament for good retention, and cut between two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upwards quickly, and pull out the head of the member.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros. Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then allow the blood to flow gradually out (it is better this way), and place sand above: and over the sand put a cloth that contains the yolk of an egg boiled in water turned pink, mixed with rose oil. Recently good: and let him lie on it until another day: and take care of it with the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form for the tool for cleansing (or perhaps surgery) is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let there be two firm ends, and let them converge: so that no branch escapes in them like the prong of a spear; and let its length be equal to the length of two sharpened points, as the length of two forearms are equally spaced.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	However, an error occurs during cleansing: because perhaps the entire skin or part of it escapes at the site of the cut.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, it must be that you extend it from your own time with your nail before dissection of the place: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then pull it out with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	And if three days pass and there remains what is under the rod inflamed, after dissection, then remove that until the scab becomes warm, and scrape it off easily, and cut it according to how you are prepared for it: and be careful from above the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	So take care of that with whatever hardens the wound from the powders, which we have described in the chapter on powders. And if it cuts through the skin above the measure and goes upwards, even that will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	So take care of this until he is healed with what we said.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	¶ On the removal of Retained Vrina in the Wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by opilation made from a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born, and similar things derived from what we said about methods of treatment in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine does not resolve, and you perceive a retention due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it must be that he should be bound above his knee for rest.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then have his feet placed on his back, and he should extend his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and the bound person should try to suck in as much air as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	He is thus forced with the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone to the back, therefore urine will be relieved.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If the issue persists after applying what we have suggested and appears to affect something frail, then it becomes necessary to administer extraction with an instrument known as a syringe. This instrument's form should be made of silver, being fine, gentle, concave like a feather from a bird in its thinness, akin in length to that of a single hand or middle hand: within which the needle should be fine at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of extracting Vrina through this is as follows: take a doubled thread, and bind yarn or wool at its end, ensuring good binding. Then insert the thread's end into the lower part of the syringe; should any excess come out from the wool when cut with scissors, simply reinsert it into the tube, just like that.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Next, soak the syringe with oil, or with butter and alum. Have the patient sit on a seat and prepare to apply the blister, using his rod along with moist oils, oil of olive, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the rod with ease until it reaches the root of the rod.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it above the part above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside it until it reaches the blister, and the patient should now feel that it has reached its target. This process is not carried out according to this order unless there is a constriction in the passage through which it moves.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then, gradually extend the thread with wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For, indeed, Vrina follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract her, and make Vrina flow through the way of urine: continue using the syringe, do not cease this practice until the bladder is emptied, and let the patient experience relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of the bladder enema with Clepsidra.
Caput LIX.	Title LI.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a wound occurs in the bladder, or blood freezes within it, or pus is constricted within it, and urine distills into that water and medicines: then one does this with an instrument called 'Clepsidra', and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is closed, in other words, it is soundproof.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And within it are three apertures, two on one side and one on the other, as you will see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave spot where that which compels is placed should be of a size so that it contains without addition what it pushes back until something is drawn out with it from the dampnesses: and when it is pushed, whatever is alongside is also forced out far away: as is done by 'clepshydra', which shoots off naphtha, in other words, Greek fire in naval battles.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	And when urine is being forced into the bladder, insert the end of the 'clepshydra' into the dampness and draw out what compels it upwards, for the dampness will be drawn into the concave part of the 'clepshydra'.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its end into the rod, as we have described with respect to the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then force the dampness along with what compels that, for indeed the dampness comes to the bladder immediately, so that an ill person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of thin enemas used when enema-ing the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Make it from silver or copper-alloy: with the head of which being higher resembling a small drinking horn, and under it a sinus between which lies a ligament.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of an iron beast and put it in the moisture you wish to irrigate the bladder with.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two thick stitches using double thread, and warm that moisture slightly over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the catheter into the bowels, afterwards press your hand onto the bladder with the moistened constriction until the patient feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If however no bladder is present for you, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle out of it, and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert the thread firmly into those holes as they twist.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then join the circle like you would join yarn: after you place in it whatever you wish from moisture, oils, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it into an instrument and operate with it as you did with the bladder by your own hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	Section: On the Extraction of Stones.
Caput LX.	Title LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already discussed the division of stone species, and their treatment with medications. We differentiated between the stone generated in the kidneys versus bladder, as well as signs pertaining to this entire process. I mentioned the stone upon which an operation is performed using one's hand or a cut. The stone that is naturally formed within the bladder exists specifically, the one that forms into a rod does as well, and I am recounting these with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say then that the stone formed in the bladder happens very often to children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs, you can see that urine comes out of the bladder similar to water in its thinness. And it appears in it as white sand, and the patient wets his rod with it and works on it continuously, hanging it up many times.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is raised, and together with it the anus appears in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of children is easy, up until they reach fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult for the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In adolescents however it is medium, in that which is between these: and the one whose kidney stone is larger has easier healing: and if small, it's treatment is opposite.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	So when we come to treatment, it is necessary first of all, to cleanse the sick person with a cataplasma, which removes all the feces that are in their intestines: for sometimes it prevents the discovery of the stone during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the sick person should be taken with their feet and rubbed, and moved towards the lower part: so that the stone may descend to the depths of the bladder, or is flushed from a high location several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then have him sit between your hands, preparing him, and let his hands be under his hips, so that the bladder may be entirely inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the stone in its place, then immediately approach with your section above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If however it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe the index finger with oil of the left hand if the sick person is a child, or the middle finger if the adolescent is fully grown, and insert it into his anus and examine the stone until it lies under your finger: and gradually turn it towards the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press it with your finger and push it outward against the place of its section. Instruct your assistant to press the bladder with his hand and instruct another assistant to extend the scrotum with his right hand towards the upper part, while using the other hand to remove the skin that is under the testicles in the area where there is a section.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the spatulate incision tool, which has this form.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find what is between the anus and testicles, not in the middle, on the left side: let the cut be above the stone, and your finger be inside the anus. And make a transverse cut so that the outer part of the cut is wide, and the inner part is narrow, according to what allows for possible ejection of the stone from there without being larger than it.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps if the finger inside the anus compresses the stone at the cut, it will come out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you will know that the stone causes difficulty in its exit because of those angles and edges.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And it is soft, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	To that which has angles and edges, add in the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out like this, then you must devise something over it: or tighten over it with your hand moved off-center, where the end is as if of the moon tightening over the stone and not allowing it to escape from there; or you could insert a fine instrument under it, with its curved tip.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If however you cannot do it over, then widen the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something is obstructed by blood, cut through with your hand.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If however the stone is more than one, then push the largest one towards the opening of the bladder first.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Next, push the smaller one after that: and do similarly if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If the large one is very much, then it is an error to cut over it with a large section.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Because illness befalls a patient with two things, either he is going to die or it happens that there is frequent diuresis: hence, because the place does not completely heal.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	True, administer the removal of it until it comes out: or you should use instruments like forceps until you extract him quickly.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	So when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with thyme, aloe, and dragon's blood. And apply pressure to it, then place an oiled or rose-scented oil-soaked cloth over it, or an ice-cold water: so that it can cool down the pus.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then turn the patient upwards on his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you then release him, wash the area with water and a great deal of oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the balsam and the basil oil until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however there is a hot pus in the wound and corrosive substances are added to it, or if similar things happen: just as if blood were to congeal in the bladder and urine flow be prevented from it: and this can be recognized by the expulsion of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	So insert your finger into the wound and draw out that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it will provoke decay of the bladder and putrefaction of its contents.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then cleanse the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply every kind of treatment that suits from the cure until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And the need is for the total time of treatment, to bind two thighs and limbs, because of the medicines that are placed over the area.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is diminutive and situated within the lumen of the reed, and it gets stuck in it, causing the urine's outlet to be blocked: then attend to that which I will instruct you before you reach the section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Indeed, through this treatment you have been relieved many times from the section, for I have already proven that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is like receiving the perforator made of balsa iron, which has this form, with its triangular end and being sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and bind it with the reed under the stone so that it does not return to the blister.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the perforating iron into the reed with ease until you reach the perforator to the stone. Then turn the perforator slowly with your hand within the stone. Continue making the perforation until it penetrates from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	Indeed, urine will be relieved immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand onto what remains from the stone on the outer part of the reed.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it breaks, and comes out with urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If this treatment is not prepared for you, because something prohibits it from him: then bind the thread under the stone, and tie another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut over the stone in the reed between the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, untie the bandage and cleanse the frozen blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone, except so that it does not return to the blister: and another bandage above, unless when the thread is untied after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and aids the wound: for this reason, you need this when you tie the thread above, so raise the skin upwards, so it returns to your own part, and aids the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the Extraction of Stones from Women.
Caput LXI.	Head 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stones are rarely formed in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If however, such a stone occurs in one of them, then the treatment is difficult, and it is forbidden due to many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that woman may perhaps be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a doctor when she is chaste, or with husbands who are present.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman who knows this art well, particularly the operation by hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the stone's location: for which it requires deep incision, and there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	Which if necessity compels to that, then you must take a woman who is a doctor, well knowledgeable: and it is found very little.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you deprive her of that, then seek out a chaste, subtle doctor, and bring before him a well-educated woman's midwife, or a woman who has taken part in this art: so make her present herself, and above all, have her do everything you instruct her about the stone based on your examination.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, what is done is to see if the woman is a virgin: then she needs to insert her finger into the anus and seek out the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If however, she finds it, constrains him under her own finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the soft abdomen of the infirm one, and inquire about the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder, and compresses it with good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If he finds a stone, then it must be moved gradually from the orifice of the bladder to below with his maximum strength until he reaches its root at the knee.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he cuts over it at the midpoint of the ulna at the knee's root, from any preparation part to him, and feels the stone in that part: and his finger does not move from the stone, constraining under it: and let the cut be small first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he inserts the rod onto that cut.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If he feels the stone then he should add into that cut according to the proportionate quantity as the stone emerges from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you will know that the kinds of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From these there is one that is slender and large, soft and rough, having branches, it can be long or round.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	And you should know its type, so that this is shown to you through what you desire.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood overcomes you, then add in the place of zinc a powder, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is removed.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out: and do so that you prepare for yourself with tools, which I said about extracting a stone from men, so that through them you assist in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been cut: then place the powder on the site, and hold it with a constriction appropriate to the powder: do not remove this: and release the stone, but do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps indeed, the sick woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	Therefore, when the pain of the blood subsides after a day, and the site decays, then return to your operation until the stone emerges.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	¶ On cutting through the aqueous hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery lump is not an external mass, unless it is a gathering of humidity within the white membrane, which is beneath the skin covering the testicle containing the urethra: and this is called the scrotal sack.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own pouch that nature has prepared for it in the part of the urethra until it seems: which is another urethra and is the skin of the testicle between the white membrane, as we said: and this does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of these branches indeed comes from weakness which happens to the testicles: therefore this material flows towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it occurs due to impact on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	This moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or its color descends to a yellow tone, or it is blood-red and red, or it is feculent, black, or it is watery white, and that which is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which one knows where the accumulation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is within the white membrane that we said, then the abscess appears round to about the length of one as the shape of the urethra: and no testicle can be seen because moisture contains it from every side.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is within its own pouch, then the abscess appears round with part of the urethra, and because of this, a man judges that there is another urethra.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sac, then it falls under sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	Therefore, when you wish to perceive the color of moisture, then experience the color of moisture during intercourse with a square insert, whose shape precedes.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to this, when it emerges in the inquiry of intercourse, judge about what is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	And when we come to treatment with iron, then you must advise the patient that if it is possible for him to undergo bloodletting and see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then it is covered on its back over the object somewhat high, and place many cloths under it.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left side, and instruct the servant to sit on his right, who will hold his stick against one or both sides of his testicles, and towards the lower part of his belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take the broad spatula and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle longitudinally up to near the pubis: and make a section according to the line that divides the skin of the testicle, until it reaches the white sac encompassing it: and scrape him and observe, or find out how to remove him: and let your scraping be with respect to the part hanging downwards more than with the ovum: and carefully examine with the scraping as much as possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then puncture the white sac full of water with an open-ended incision, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between two cuts with the scissors, and extend the white part upwards, and do not touch the skin that surrounds the testicles: and strike it wherever possible to hit it, or entirely, or in fragments, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, there is no security in his operation that water will not return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	And if it proceeds outside its skin before your time of operation: then when you have completed the section, take him back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join the two foreskins with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for him as you would other wounds until he has healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	And if you find that the organ has been corrupted by a different kind of blackness, then it is necessary to tie the cords which are the support, fearing blood loss.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its support and remove it: afterwards care for this with what we have already mentioned.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	And if water is found gathered in two parts, then you will know that there are two branches. Therefore cut the other part like what you did with the first, evenly.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, as one operation, then do this: and afterwards cleanse the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert in the sections wool submerged in oil, or in rose oil; and place another piece of wool outside that which you have soaked in wine and oil, spreading it over the two testicles, covering them with your belly: and place above that double cloths, they are called puluilli, tie these above with a ligament according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	And then take two cloths and soak them, filling the wool with carmine as per this likeness: and make ends that are pressed out from the crotch or wet wool; and they are attached with the bandage at the lower backbones: one end will receive above the anus up to the spine, and the other receives down to the part of the thighs: and both ends over the two buttocks below, and the other two ends on each side of the groin, and the whole band is attached in the lower backbones.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And at times, it is medicated artificially with a cautery in place of the section with iron. And you should take the surgical tool that resembles a fine knife and cut off the skin of the testicles. Proceed as we have described: until when something white, containing water, is revealed. Then receive the cautery according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letters are assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with that sifac and light it until all moisture has come out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the sifac with hooks and scrape it using a finely ignited cautery, cutting down on it as much as possible to you until you uproot all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And sweat from the egg, so that the fire does not touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you will know that this operation is beneficial and lasts longer without bleeding, and it is better than an operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If however it opposes you in the hour of cutting, or in the hour of the hot pustule after cautery application, or bleeding, or something else: then you must treat what opposes you using the treatment that suits it, according to what was previously stated.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If the patient is fearful and does not anticipate this operation due to its horror, then administer the following perforation as I describe it: and it will be.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are informed by yourself about the thing that we said about the indications where the limb is watery; then it should be that you make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the pustule from its lower part with a broad spatula: and make the piercing along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a pad over the wound site, bind it in place and let him walk off the excess water residue. Afterwards care for him until the injury heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however a contradiction occurs with the ejection of water during the hour when you pierce it: and if this is not just because; as white flannel creates a contradiction at the wound opening and prevents the escape of water: then it is necessary to introduce a feather into the wound, or an instrument used for removing water from hydrophobia, whose shape precedes this method. Or add this process in operation for wounds.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you will know that the water returns and accumulates around six weeks, or about this time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	And when it accumulates, then it is treated in the same manner, and the patient will pass through his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	¶ On the care of Ramicis for carnosae.
Caput LXIII.	Title LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that within the section above this Ramicis, there is often a fear of losing one's balance leading to danger in various orientations.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me that its removal would be beneficial from that.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am recalling the procedure for that and considering the condition of the patients.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say that many conditions occur in patients, from which the testicles are composed; and this happens due to multiple causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute excess, or sharpness, which flows towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from being struck.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the appearance of an abscess matches the body's color and no pain is felt: and it is serious abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a phlegm of stones, whose color is dark brown and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens due to the knotting of arteries and their expansion; as has already been recalled: or from the expansion of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Therefore, which is due to the expansion of arteries, can be recognized by the position of phlegms when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary to touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	However, that which happens due to the expansion of veins does not spread out from it when compressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it's possible that this kind of operation can be performed on top of this specimen and on other meats: and it happens that the skin of the testicles is separated.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the scrotum upwards and extract it together with its white sitch: and free the suspension from the wounds, and tie up the wounds: and cut off the suspension after you have freed it completely from all parts of the scrotum.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If however the scrotum has been consolidated with those born meats, then it is necessary to hold the scrotum and cut into it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adherence between something from the spermatic sheath or in what is between the wounds: then it is necessary to free the entire of that adherence and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	And if there is birth of flesh in the place of adherence which is behind: then it is necessary to cut all of it and extract the scrotum as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with gauze soaked in rose oil and wine: afterwards care for it along with other treatments until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the care of Ramicis, which is with Vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Head 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It is an abscess behind the eye that is enclosed by a certain process, similar to a lump, with the softening of the testicles: and it causes difficulty in movement and exercise for the sick person, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this ailment is from fear, due to that which preceded it and is recalled.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	However, we must say the operation on it according to how the firsts did it.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I therefore say that you should make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the scrotum forward towards below.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the scrotum skin with your fingers, using instruments that are close to a staff: and let another person hold them and extend them vigorously.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an oblique cut with a broad sharp instrument across the area directly from one end to the other until you expose the instruments.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape away from every part as we have instructed you regarding the removal of arteries which are in sinews.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then secure with an iron needle where there is a double thread, and bind it at the first places that encounter vines: and bind it again at the last of these.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut those things centrally with a straight section according to the length of the body, and extract what accumulates from the moist, decayed substances.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the wound with care of other wounds, where there is a tendency to generate pus, so that the feeding vessels which nourish one testicle fall off.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not bad for that reason.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If however this happens with Vitis for all discharges, then it is necessary that they remove the testicles because of this during discharges: in order not to deprive the urine of its nourishment due to an incision and for it to either boil or dry up, or not be beneficial with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	¶ On the care of the Intestinal Ramus.
Caput LXV.	Head 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The result of this Intestinal Ramus is from a tear that happens in the small intestine stretched above the belly in the part behind the abdomen.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture towards one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this tear can be either from the small intestine or due to its stretching.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis. Aut ex percussione. Aut saltu. Aut clamore. Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds happen due to various causes. Or from being struck. Or from jumping. Or from loud noise. Or from lifting heavy objects and similar activities.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign is when it occurs due to the stretching of the small intestine.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	What happens is that it occurs gradually over a long period of time and does not happen suddenly. There is an equal swelling towards depth due to the fact that the small intestine compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	The sign when it happens due to a section of the small intestine is that it causes an intense sudden pain. There is also a different pus visible under the skin close by, and this occurs because of the exit of the intestine and its course towards the small intestine externally.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it comes out with the intestine in a bundle: and this is called the Intestinal Ramus and the bundle. And sometimes it occurs with wind.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes, feces run into the intestines and are retained there: and it is with them the weakness of sick people: because it causes to happen a dull pain, and especially when pressure is applied.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the care of this illness's symptoms with iron there is fear: therefore, it must be guarded against such occurrences.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is: to advise the sick person, instructing them to use their hand to return the intestine to its natural inner concavity, if it yields to being returned.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then they wrap the wound around their neck between your hands: and raise their legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin which follows the skin upwards, and cut the entire skin of the testicles along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix the two edges of the cut like hooks according to your need for opening up the cut with them. And the cut should be made as much as is possible so that it can allow things to come out freely.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Next scrape the scrotum and what is under the skin until when the white fat part becomes hard from all sides. Then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, between that which is under the white fat part under the skin, and that following the fat. Do this up to the part of adhesion in the posterior part of the body.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Next move with your right hand into the inner skin of the testicles: and as you do this, spread the white fat part upwards with your left hand: and raise the body up together with the white fat. And advise your assistant to lift the body upwards too: and then resolve any remaining adhesion, fully completing the separation.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And use your fingers to ensure that there is nothing from the intestine left twisted inside the white hard fat.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If you find anything from it: then urge him downwards towards the belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a thimble in which there is a thick thread, formed from a ligature of ten threads: and introduce it at the very end of this structure, that is, the sheath, which follows the section under the skin covering the testicles. Then cut the ends that protrude from the thread until there are four strands.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then compose some of them over each other with a pattern that resembles the shape of a cross: and tie them together with the asifach (which we have mentioned), because it is located under the skin covering the testicles, tightly enough so that no secretion from what nourishes them can be released towards them: in order that no pus pocket may form there due to heat.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place another band again beyond the first band, lengthwise from it by less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two bands, release from the sheath which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity equivalent to the size of a finger: and cut off the rest completely according to roundness, and remove it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles from where blood flows, and sew properly: as we have instructed in what has been mentioned beforehand.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply the oil-soaked wool and place it in the wound: and administer the bandage we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white sheath that we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Indeed, this happens many times.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And cut the band until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If however the case is delayed, then it should be treated with warm water: and place on top of it what we have mentioned until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for a wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	In respect to windy ram's flesh.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this, I have not heard of anyone who would dare to use iron in the treatment of ram's flesh.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they said that it happens as we have narrated about the ram's flesh which is with the vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	This is, you bind the ligatures after cutting it over it with ease below: then cut in the middle, and finally, take care of it according to what we mentioned until it opens itself; and the treatment for the wound, as we said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	In respect to the rupture that occurs in the groin area.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groins as we have said, and the affected area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: if it does descend, then it is somewhat less than what should be and returns repeatedly at all times; but if it continues with that for some time, an opening is added in such a place until the intestines descend into that place.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens due to the expansion of 'sifach', which is located in the groin area as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	This occurs because 'sifach' expands; then the area softens and inflates, and protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with cauterization, as was previously described.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron according to this method: and the situation happens where they lie sick on their back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the protruded and inflamed area of the rupture, cutting through its width according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then bind the asifa and what is under the skin until when the white fat follows it, that which is beneath the skin following this.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the root and place it on the prominent spot from the white fat, and press it down to the depth of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then make two prominent sites on the end of the root from the white fat, and connect one of them with a stitch to the other: then remove the end of the root.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not completely cut the asifa, nor stretch any other part, as I taught you about treating intestinal thorns.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then attend to that with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you then fall upon thread, cleanse that, and heal the wound until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	The asifa contracts and does not extend to the prominence of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And it is better to use cautery in this place, because it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	¶ Regarding the softening of the scrotal skin.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The scrotal skin of some people is softened many times, which causes the surrounding flesh to be softened as well, spoiling its appearance.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore, whoever is asked to treat it must make the sick person lie on their back and cause the entire softened skin to be applied over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then bind the two lips with stitches: and if you wish, remove three or four excesses of the softened skin first, and then apply firm stitching.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then, the care for the remaining wound(s), until it is healed and the threads fall.
¶ De Castratione.	¶ On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Head 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You know that castration is condemned by our law and for this reason it was appropriate not to recall it in my book; and there is no need to remember it unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	The reason is that one of them is so that this should be known to the doctor when he is asked about it and thus he would know how to deal with someone who has undergone such a procedure.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other reason is that we often need to know about castration of certain animals for our benefits, like with rams, horses, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore, I say that castration can be done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or through attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or through a crack and division.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In the case of castration that is done through attrition, the method is: to make us place the animal in warm water until his testicles soften and become soft and hang down. Then remove them with your hand until they dissolve and no longer appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration through a crack and division, you must hold the animal and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then attach the support band and cut above every testicle section until two pieces of sperm come out: then perform this after you have scalded both, but do not leave anything on them except a fine tip that is over the penis.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that done through attrition because with attrition perhaps something may remain from the testicles which would cause the animal to desire copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	The treatment for the Hermaphrodite in two ways.
Caput LXX.	Head 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	The Hermaphrodite is according to two methods from humans.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears in him what follows the space, or under the skin of the testicles, in which there is a shape like a female head, in which hair is present: and sometimes urine flows from that which is under the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women however there is a single species and it's like the head of a female on top of the pubis just like small testicles in men, standing out to the external side: of which one is like the prepuce of man, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment for the three species, two from men and one from women, is: because it must happen that you enter the added flesh until the impression of them goes away.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for these with the remaining wound's treatment.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	As for the second species of men, from which urine comes out, which is under the skin of the testicles, there is no operation and indeed its treatment in full does not exist.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	¶ On the excision of the Tentillum, and the projecting flesh in wounds of women.
Caput LXXI.	Head 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The Tentillum perhaps adds upon the natural thing until it is torn and its appearance becomes ugly: and sometimes it magnifies so much in some women that it extends like in men, and arrives up to intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore you must hold the excess of the Tentillum with your hand or using a hook, and enter: and do not stop at the incision, especially at the depth of the root: so as to not occur bleeding.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care itself for the treatment of wounds until they are healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	And flesh having come forth, it is the flesh that is born in the womb's opening until it fills it up; and perhaps it will emerge towards the exterior according to the likeness of a tail: hence some call it the illness with a tail.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	So we must treat her as we would treat a Tentigine, and care for her until she is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	¶ Concerning the treatment of Albritic, which is the womb of an unperforated woman.
Caput LXXII.	Title 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica refers to the womb of an unperforated woman, or one with a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it can be natural, or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental Alratica results from an illness that preceded it. It can be formed by added flesh, or something thin like a needle, or thick, and might occur deep inside the womb, on its sides, at the top of it, or at the bottom. It prevents sexual intercourse, fertilization, childbirth, and possibly menstrual cycles as well.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of that is made through the observation of midwives, if pregnancy is clearly apparent nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers or with the help of a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If pregnancy is due to something thin like a needle and is located between the two lips: then approach it gently, and break it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And you should place it over the two small lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then put your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then widen both lips with strength until the delicate sifach is broken and the wound opens.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take the wool and soak it in oil, then place it on the site. And let a woman defile herself every day there so that the site does not become solid instead of other things.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however the sifach is large and thick, then it is necessary to separate it with a broad spatula like a laurel leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If the wound is born from flesh, then hang it with hooks and cut it. And have with you medicine that stops bleeding without cauterizing, such as Acacia, dragon's blood, and a mixture added with urine.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a large lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly or at all, hold it for several days. Then apply linseed oil and afterwards treat the rest of the healing process until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes they are born inside the body of others born: hence it must happen according to this method: while there is no pustule for a tumor, for one that is within the womb is not opposed with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	¶ On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athelil and Bothor's redness in women's wounds.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed an opening of the venous canals, until a large amount of blood flows from them regularly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore hemorrhoids occur, they produce Athelil. And I have already discussed this among the division of their types and their signs; now I will explain what receives treatment from them, and what does not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I therefore say that hemorrhoids which are within the birth canal and do not show themselves to touch: then there is no treatment for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	As for those among them that are within the birth canal where sensation falls, they are which are treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, it is necessary to introduce the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend with thongs or with rough cloth, and strike them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then, while the blood flows, dust the area with one of the cutting powders without cauterization: like Acacia, dragon's blood, and oil, and similar items.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push her feet towards the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the bleeding persisted: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and rind of oranges, and egg shells, and similar items.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a paste with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood is taken with it, it is good: and if not, make the back and breasts stick with suction cups, without incision.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and immerse it in the extract of garlic, or in the extract from an ox tongue, or in the juice of branches of the alaulat tree, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and make it stick with beeswax.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the blister then rests, take care of the area with ointment until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth is similar to the red heads of thorns, and has an abrasive appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, you must enter what appears from it, according to what I said about in thelil equally: and take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	¶ On Perforation that occurs in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	Head 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many species of abscess occur in the matrix, such as cancer, and stone abscess, and ulcers, and scabs, and boils, that is, herpes, and blisters, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and warts, and thelil, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And indeed, I have already mentioned all these illnesses and their species, and the symptoms of them, and their treatments. It is necessary that I speak about hot abscesses which occur in the matrix when they are formed from abscesses that collect pus, and one must know how its opening occurs with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you must consider this.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is sharp with a strike to it, and heat, and fever: and you see it become red: if it falls over it upon sensation, then do not twitch when perforating it: and take care of it with him so that it benefits in maturation, until when the intensity of accidents quiesces.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then you must have the woman sit on a chair with two seats that bend under her buttocks, and recline, or she may rest against her back and gather her feet towards her lower abdomen: and let her thighs be spread out, and place her arms under her knees, and tie each one with a ligament to this.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife will sit on the right side, and she administers the tool that opens the passage of the matrix.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	The form of whom comes about in those that are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it should be that when you wish to administer this tool, you hold it with the tip of the radio deeply in a woman's womb: so that which goes out from the tool is not more than the depth of the womb and does not harm the patient.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the tool is larger than the depth of the womb then you should place cotton over the inner lining of the womb's depth, so that the whole entry of the tool cannot reach into the womb's depth and to prevent the whirlwind, which runs in the tool, from going all the way down the side. And one must hold the instrument and rotate the whirlwind until the womb's depth opens.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	And when the exit appears and is touched by hand and feels soft and fleshy, then one should take it with their head using a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	And when it is discharged cleanly, then you should place the lid of a wound submerged in rose oil: or in green oil where there's some firmness. And place the lid and extract the section within the womb deeply.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place it outside over the womb and over clean cotton cloth submerged in water in which the apples have boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then heal with the appropriate ointment for two days, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that they are rinsed with water and honey: then rinse them again with water in which the root of the lily or long aristolochia has boiled. Then return to using the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden inside the womb, then you must avoid treating it with iron instead, indeed treat it with what we said about division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The doctrine of obstetrics, how they treat embryos alive, according to a figure that is not natural.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to first know the natural figure of childbirth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From these signs you can tell: when you see a woman pressing towards her lower parts, and desires to sniff the air, and rejoices over what is upon her regarding childbirth, and hastens the birth of the embryo: then you know that this birth follows the natural figure, and it is its exit above its head, and with its second stage: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary for her belly to be pressed, so that the embryo may quickly descend.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends upon its head, it also descends the second stage with it, and is purified from those excesses by a good purification.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	And anything else beyond this birth is unnatural, unpraiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	Because sometimes it begets the fetus on its feet, and its body goes out before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and its hand go out: or its abdomen emerges: and perhaps it turns upon its own neck, and similar things from unpraiseworthy figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	So it is necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent and subtle in all these matters, and beware of error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and how the skill is in that, and it is explained through this, and it is established upon him.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges above its head in its natural egress and it becomes high upon her, making childbirth difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then have her sit on a chair, or women hold her up. And let her inhale steam with boiled garlic and with humid oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife will introduce a small spatula between her fingers and find with it the second part, and clean it with her finger until she has removed everything that is in it from moisture: and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it still does not descend, then the woman should be treated with a senna enema, mixed with safflower oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then instruct her to be squeezed after the enema, and have her blow her nose when she sneezes, and hold her mouth and nostrils together for a moment.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will immediately come out.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus come out first, it is necessary to gradually reduce them with ease.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not obey at the entrance, then place the woman on a seat and lift her feet upwards: then strike the seat against the ground: and let the woman be held so that she does not fall upon the impact.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut them, and extract the rest of the fetus: and tie his hand with a cloth, and pull him out evenly: for he will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo over its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out over its feet, then it must push them upwards: afterwards turn the fetus gradually: and then settle him.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they come out up to the thighs, then instruct her to be squeezed, and have her blow her nose when she sneezes: for she will come out if God willing.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have told you, then gradually reduce the fetus until you place him according to the natural figure.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For then he will emerge with ease.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is prevented from doing what we have described: then take of the high gum, and of the safflower oil, and dissolve the gum: and crush everything in a mortar until it is well crushed. Then mix it with the hair of a woman, and below her waist.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she feels the womb descending.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	And when you see that her lower parts have warmed up, then make her drink some myrrh and let it take effect.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she has retained the drink for an hour, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and pinch her mouth and nose, and gently press the lower part of her stomach.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	The urine will immediately emerge.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The birth of the fetus is over, above the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it emerges according to this form, then guide its passage with your hands gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman is to be laid on her back with her neck supported by a pillow, and her feet hanging down below. And she herself should lie on the bed, folding her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then gently press on her stomach gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then remove what is under her feet from the uterus until she is ready in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a vigorous motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the womb gradually until the fetus ascends to the higher parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert her hands and gradually adjust the position of the fetus: and instruct the woman to compress herself until the fetus emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The outcome is a fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	The method for reducing (or correcting) the position of their hands is devised.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If she cannot reduce it, then lift up the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she cannot walk, then have her lie down on the bed: and shake her legs vigorously.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the ointment you prepared from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she has received it and gives birth, then have her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then focus on reducing her hands, and place the fetus according to its natural shape: and have the woman sneeze, and instruct her to press herself until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The outcome is for the fetus to be on its head, with its arms extended, and it presents its face towards the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually rotate it, and ease it into position with facilitation.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is aligned, then place upon the oil mixture for which we have instructed from oil and mucus above.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then have her sit on a chair, and instruct her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct her to press herself: and have her sneeze vigorously.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The prepared fetus is placed on the side for delivery.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends through the mother's opening according to this manner with a thread, then cut the thread using your nail until it is freed by moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it is suspended over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it out from the belly button: so that it does not get stuck and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Next, urge the fetus towards the insides until you place it according to what is necessary: and advise the woman to press herself occasionally: for it will come out through a slight opening.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	分娩双胞胎，或是多胎的分娩。
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins often give birth: and sometimes they give birth to three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	But this is an unusual occurrence and happens rarely.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	However, there are five things that occur outside the natural order and do not survive completely: they contain them although they multiply into a double unit, and separate them through a siphon, distinguishing each one by their umbilical cord which is tied together.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out like one fetus comes out naturally, easily: and they come out through an impossible opening, as we have told.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	And if some of them are difficult during childbirth and resort to what we said about the unnatural figures, then treat them as we have instructed: let there be a fine forceps, and perform its actions with ease and delay, and adapt it according to every figure using whatever is prepared for him by someone skilled in medicine for his benefit.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember that which forms within the womb from embryos, and is aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes within the womb, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed: and it has been confirmed to me that a woman who was miscarrying gave birth to seven, and another fifteen, all of them fully formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	What has been done is the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, everything should be known in the science of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will come to resemble that similar one; therefore, compare it with what needs to be done.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Section: On the removal of dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When treatments for a dead fetus with what I said about dividing the drug mixture, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with your hands, then you should consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound virtue, and not with any from among those accidents by which loss is feared for her: then it must be that she is laid on a bed on her back, facing upwards, and her head is bent downwards, and her legs are lifted. And the attendants should hold her at both sides or tie her to the bed, so that her body does not move when removing the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the womb by using oils and mucus from high fennel and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then, the midwife will moisten her hand with these oils and mucus: afterwards, she will insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then, searching for where within her the midwife should place the hooks of the fetus, and finding the appropriate locations for this.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	So consider then if the fetus is prepared to descend over its head: then fix the hooks on its eyes, or around its neck, or in its mouth, or on the palate of itself, or under its beard, or in the gullet, or in the vicinity of its ribs, and below the pubis.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If the descent is over his feet, then in the heel, and in the middle of its ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it must hold the hook with his right hand and place its curvature in that which is between the left hand's fingers: and he should insert it with ease using the hand until he fixes the hook in one of those places we described, until he reaches an empty spot.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fix another hook opposite the first one, or a third if needed, so that there is an equal tension and it does not lean towards any part.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then extend with an equal expansion, and do not make the extension only according to straightness; rather move it towards every part so that its outlet is relieved: just as happens when a tooth is being pulled out in dental extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it must be soft and relaxed where there is that, regarding the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a portion is being held from there, then it should be that the midwife oils some fingers and inserts them from a side, so that she can rotate with them what is being held.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a portion of the fetus emerges, then the hooks are changed to another position that is higher: do this until the entire fetus has emerged.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand emerges before the others, and it is not possible to reduce it due to its constriction: then one must fold a cloth over that.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it out until when the whole of it has emerged, cut it either at the junction of the sole or at the elbow: and you should do this both in the other hand, and with both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the fetus's head is large or a constriction occurs during its exit, or water has accumulated in the head: then it must insert the Spatula spinosa between the fingers and guide its head while extracting the water with it: or break it using the tool called Almisdac; which shape comes after all other tool shapes in this chapter.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it should extract the algengamath: or remove it with the misda, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then grasp the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	And if the head is coming out and it's being constrained at the waist: then one should pull until moisture begins to pour out from inside the chest.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it is not complicated and does not yield to the delivery: then strike the head quickly, according to what you are able.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	And if it is in or below the belly, or there is water retention in that area: then you must puncture it until moisture flows out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	And if the fetus is above its feet, then the pull on it will be easy and the direction to the maternal opening will be gentle.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	And if it's being constrained at the belly or chest: then you should pull it out with the cloth you wrapped around your hand: and strike the belly, or chest, until whatever is inside them begins to flow.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	And if the rest of the limbs are removed and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	And if the maternal opening is open, then she should insert her hand deeply into the womb and seeks out with it the head, pulling it by the fingers until it reaches the maternal opening: then she should insert one hook or two hooks in it and pull it with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	And if the maternal opening is constrained due to a hot pus that happens to it: then one should not labor on it, rather one should then administer an emission of humid things and greasy substances. And apply ointment: and sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is above its own side, then it's possible for it to be balanced: then what we said about a living fetus will be administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible for that, then an immediate failure has occurred, and extraction should take place.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And you must ensure that nothing is left from the second stage entirely inside.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	So when you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about the hot inflammations that occur in the womb.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If blood flow occurs, then move to cold收敛 water, and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed, I have seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus; subsequently she was pregnant with another one, then yet another fetus died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	So after a long time, an abscess occurred at her navel and swelled up until it opened, and she began to expel pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore summoned for her treatment and I treated her over a long period of time, yet the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	So I applied certain strong plasters on it and from that place, an opening appeared.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then after some days passed, another opening emerged.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore surprised at this, since there is no hole in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	So I reasoned that they were from the bones of dead fetuses.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I examined the wound and extracted many bones from it while the woman was in better positions. And she had been living through this for a long time and now only slightly expels pus.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not attach this foreign body here unless it was necessary because there is knowledge and assistance for what the skillful doctor, using his hands, does in treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of the necessary instruments for the extraction of the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Title 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Below is the form of the Stricter, with which the volumes are adjusted, having two twists each at both ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this Twist must be finer than the Stricter: and to make it so, either use wood of ebony or wood of the tambour.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the width of all the wood be as if it were two fingers: and each edge of both is like one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same type of wood which have already been fixed on both ends, whose length is half a palm and slightly more than that: and the width of each is as if it were two fingers, or slightly more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And those two additions penetrate the womb's mouth so that it opens when you rotate two twists with them.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the Twist which opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, but finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of wood from ebony or tambour, according to the shape of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, there must be two additions at its end, as you see above: and the length of all those extensions from them is like a palm; and the width of each one is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	So when you want to open the womb with it, then have the woman sit on the bed, hanging her legs down, with what is between her thighs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then, introduce those two additions joined together into the womb: and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the tool as you do with tweezers, evenly according to the amount that can be achieved from the opening of the uterus passage, until the midwife does what she wishes.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The Form of Dizziness, as the ancients said, is the Form that Drives, in which the fetus is pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The Form of Almisdac, by which the large head is delivered: and it is similar to a forceps, which has teeth at its end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is oblong, like a forceps according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which one enters and delivers.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The Form of Almisdac, by which the small head is delivered.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The Form of One Holding a Prick or刺.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The Form of One Holding Two Spurs.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The Form of the forceps which has teeth like those of a saw, by which the head of the fetus is delivered.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The Form of One Having Two Endings for Cutting Off the Head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The Form of Two Spatumils, also suitable for labor.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All of these instruments can be used, and the more their various types are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the swifter they are for their task, and the higher in esteem among men due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, you should not disdain any of these instruments that may be prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	It is undeniable that their necessity is beyond reproach.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Section on the Extraction of the Second Member.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When Secundina is retained during childbirth, then you must encourage the weak one to hold onto her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze as you press against her; and place your hand over her mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If she then escapes through this method, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not, then take a pot and pierce in the lid an opening; and put inside it opening herbs of the birth canal, like that of the reed, myrrh, and poppy, and chamomile, and ginger, and lignum cinnamomi, and centaury: take all these herbs or some of them, and immerse them with water, and place them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a sheaf of reed over the opening of the pot lid, and another end of it in her birth canal: and let her hold onto it until steam reaches the curvature of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	Indeed, Secundina will then come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	However, if it still remains after this treatment and does not escape: then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand into safflower oil or althaea mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then she should insert it into the uterus and search for Secundina with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	Once she finds it, then take it and gradually extend her out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	However, if it is attached deeply within the womb, then insert her hand as we have described until she finds Secundina. Then gradually extract her with a gentle pull, ensuring not to cause the uterus to fall due to harsh pulling. It should be done with ease alternating between the right and left sides. Afterwards, add an amount equivalent to the force of the extraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	Indeed then it obeys, and is served, and treated against sticking.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the womb's mouth is constricted, as we have already narrated: care for it with a sneeze, and from the medicine of the pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If it does not come out as we have described, then beware that you do not tire yourself over her in the process of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	However, it must be that whatever comes out from the womb's opening is tied to the woman's hipbone.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then, cleanse her with a tetrapharmaceutical ointment enema.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will decay after days, and dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it decays, an unpleasant smell rises to the stomach and head, and this harms her.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, appropriate inhalations must be administered for that.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the old experts already know how to perform an inhalation with watercress and dried fennel.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The shape of the instrument used for inhalation by a woman during retention of Secunda and menses is as follows.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Make it similar to an ashtray or out of wood; place the broad end on fire: and have the inhalation placed above the plums: hold it until that inhalation is consumed: and repeat another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Section 42: On the treatment of Unperforated Anal Fistulas
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many infants are born and their anus is unperforated, which the siphon has already slightly filled.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife should pierce that sphincter with her finger: and if not, she should pierce it with a sharp spoon: and beware of tearing, do not let it touch him.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over it wool that has been soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If you fear that it will be removed, then place a tube made of lead in the hole for many days, and it is removed when the child wants to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now, an eruption occurs in Ani as well, due to the healing of wounds or ulcers.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, that consolidation must be cut off, and then take care of it using what we said about treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Section on the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower region are Nodation and Enlargement which happen near the anus: or within the space of one part: and there is either a single fistula, or multiple ones.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	And when that nodulation is opened, it is drained, and moisture or subtle pus runs out from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas have penetrating ones from them.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, the penetrating fistulas are recognized by what comes out during defecation and wind when the patient is using it. And perhaps worms may also come out from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas that originate when they penetrate through the space up to a blister and even up to the flesh of the bow.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And there are penetrating fistulas that go as far as the joint of the thigh and even to the tail's knot.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	Therefore, to recognize whether the fistula goes up to the anus from one that does not penetrate deeply, you can insert your index finger into the anus. And if you insert a subtle probe through air or iron into the fistula, when there is no twist, it confirms that the fistula extends as far as the anus even in cases of non-penetrating fistulas.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is curvature within it, then introduce into it a尝试subtle lead wire, or a thorn from the hooves of horses, until you feel the wire or thorn in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel the entire object, and there is no discharge from the hole with any output, nor a sensation of air passage, nor like a worm as I said: then you will know that it is penetrating. So proceed to treatment accordingly.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating up to a blister, or to the bladder of urine: then its indication is the discharge of urine from there, and the prohibition of it from this so that the site can be strengthened with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If indeed it is penetrating up to the joint of the thigh, or to the mouth of the thigh: then its sign is that a probe will come through until there, if there is no curvature up to the mouth: and finding pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus always emerges from there: and that medicine cannot be effective in it, nor does consolidation occur with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrable fistulas there is no complete cure: and the treatment of them is a task and futility for those who create it, out of foolish doctors.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In those that are not penetrable and not old, recovery is hoped with compression: as I tell you, and I have already tested it: and there is the case where they lie sick between your hands on their back: and raise his legs up to above his hips, and his thighs be inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce the lead or air, if there is curvature in the fistula, until you know where the probe has gone.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If however the sick person feels it around the anus, then you must introduce your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If indeed you feel that the probe has already penetrated through itself by way of detection within your finger or between it and flesh, then certainly you will know for sure that it is penetrable. Therefore there are no efforts to be made in such an affair, because there is no cure for him as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said however, that the flesh heals in certain men, and by the medicine with which one hopes for his benefit, it is that fine cautery is performed according to the width of the fistula as previously described, and you insert the ignited thing into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then perform this procedure twice or three times, until you know that all the added flesh, which is like bird's feathers tubes, have been sufficiently heated.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for this with bandages soaked in butter until the heated flesh comes out: then care for it with ointments that generate tissue and strengthen.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it shall not be cured with any other treatment either.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the probe emerges and does not reach up to your finger which is at the anus or there's a thick layer of skin meat in between it and the probe, or flesh: then you would see that there is a fistula within what follows the skin surface. Then cut away the skin from the start of the fistula, and as you are pulling through with the probe, anything within the fistula until the cutting reaches where the tip of the probe reaches, and when the probe is pulled out, it will fall out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those flesh pieces that resemble bird's feather tubes, so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however blood overcomes you and flows between you and your operation, causing those flesh pieces to fall out, then it is better what happens next and for swifter aid, to cauterize that with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because when cautery is combined with fire, it adds the heating of those flesh parts, and the cutting off of blood, and drying out of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then the care is to have it wrapped with lice in butter or crushed fat until the place emits pus and those flesh parts that are heated by pus emerge.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then the care is to have wounds with salves that harden and generate tough flesh: and these are medicines which have compression and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they heal again, then the wound is truly healed: and you do not seek repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has already reached to the depth of the anus and extends due to the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus and explore with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	But if you feel it penetrates and there is a layer of pus or flesh between you and it, whether close to the penetration: then there is no operation in that case unless according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is that one of the three methods administered in it: either by applying cautery to it as we said: or by excising it until you find its cavity, so that it will be possible for you to insert a ligature and to treat it with proximity.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too much with the cut, so as not to enter a duct containing the anus, and result in an unwanted discharge without意愿 for the sick.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then follow this care with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed: or you may lengthen the layer of pus and cleanse it after cutting it close to the anus as we have said, or upon touching, or with another sharp tool at its extremity.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those cut flesh masses which are within the section, as far as you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the restoration of all wounds with the whole section, and the upper opening where it is consolidated: and there will remain an open fistula within the part of the anus, and it will be easier for the sick person.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula is sewn according to this manner: and it is thus, when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it's in the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and edge of the anus. Then take a probe at the perforated end, which is like a needle, that is, prepared intestines, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert a thread withdrawn from five threads into it, and roughly around that area.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until you reach its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it penetrates into the edge of the anus internally nearby, then withdraw the thread from that hole: so that you can insert your finger into the anus and remove the end of the thread, and unite both ends together: and tighten both, and release them on one or two days: and the longer the thread goes into the flesh, tightly pull it until those tissues between the two ends of the thread fall: then care for the wound, until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	And if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in any manner that is prepared for you, unless it be deeply embedded.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not within your ability to do this for the sake of the scab, so that you might not hit it [the probe].
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then proceed with it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the Spathamils pin-like instrument used for making a fistula, whose sharp part is strongly acute and the other part is not so acute to avoid hitting what is unnecessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows out after the operation, and care for fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Title 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are two ways of having hemorrhoids.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or indeed they occur inside the anus, similar to blisters or pieces of coal, or like small grains.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from these there are those that are single and large, and blood flows out of them always; there is one kind like this and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they occur outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that occur outside the anus are generally of low moisture content, from which yellowish water or a slight continuous flow of blood emerges; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	The treatment for those inside the anus is to advise the patient to take a bath and cleanse thoroughly until the anus can be seen, and you will observe the worms.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, hang them with hooks or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If however they are not held by the hooks due to their and their softness, then capture them with a rough cloth or with a stick made of double thread, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them and after making certain incisions on the site, apply some hot powders over them to substitute for cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	They should be cauterized according to what precedes in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then attend to them with the rest of the treatment until they recover.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not respond to expulsion, then treat the patient with a mild enema where there is a small bite mark, so that it will expel what is inside the anus and quickly allow for expulsion when the patient starts to expel.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If the stones are outside the anus, then their condition is light and easy: it is as if you could catch them with your finger or with a hook, and you would insert them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then attend to them with what we have said until they recover.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And for those who fear the operation with iron, then it is necessary to apply stitches to them according to this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a thread and insert it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull the stone upwards and make it pierce with the point at its other side into the root. And take hold of both ends of the thread below the tip of the needle, making them parallel; and pull the stone tightly shut.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie the thread, and pull out the point.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all stones, and remove one from them: do not let it bleed excessively, so that it may heal from the excess of blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or aloe, and place it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let him go until he falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the stones then fall, attend to them with ointment and other treatments until they recover.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the Care of Wounds.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For often this happens from the drying out of feces and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	And when they dry up, and medicine no longer benefits them: then it is necessary to use roots with punctures of Spatiumilis, or with your nail, until they become moist, and the upper cortex is removed which prevents their consolidation.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them until they consolidate as required.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	And if they do not consolidate: then repeat them with a more intense reason than the first, until they bleed much, and are then scraped afterwards. Care for them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the care of Almirmar inverted, and not inverted, as well as Athelil drying up, and Formicae.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, resembling the head of a spike; and it forms throughout the body, especially on the lower parts of the feet and fingers: and pain occurs from them upon walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it must be cut what is within the circumference of the spike head and held with forceps or with a hook, and removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for that: and if necessary, cauterize it according to what precedes in its own chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From Athelil dry ones, there is one that is a small prominent elevation, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And it often happens on children's hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	The treatment for it is to spread Athelil and strike it: or tie it with a silk thread, or with wool until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if necessary, cauterize it according to what has been provided with fire or with sharp medicine: and now the reversed thorns are eradicated, both those that were turned inwards and those that were not, using the tool I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	And the ant is also a small filtrated prominence, thick, spreading over the body surface, penetrating deeply. And when it finds cold, it feels like an ant bite inside, and affects the entire body. And much of it happens in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is to take a tube from the goose feather or turkey feather and place this tube on the ant until it holds a circle of the parts of it.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then rotate your hand with the tube until you remove what is within the circle of the ant. And place it deeply into the flesh and eradicate the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do this with an air or iron tube, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Place the tube of the cannula upwards to its limit, pulling outwards until it touches the tip of your finger and the rotation of both.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was provided for cauterizing Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	¶ About the instruments which are used for enemas in bowel disorders and for relieving the stomach, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or of brass, or of blown or hammered air.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made from these small and large instruments according to how they are used.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is administered in the care of small children or infants, let it be for small ones: and of those who are weak or painful, thus also enemas for them.
Clistere magnum.	A large enema.
Cistere paruum.	A small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The tool he refers to, that is the upper part where it's tied around the uterus, should be wide according to this manner: and there must be distinction so that you can tie the uterus like you see it being tied. And the lower end of this which enters into the anus, should be closed off, meaning not open, soft, very much so as to pull it towards thinness: and on one side of its body are two holes, and on the other side of the body there is one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the size of the hole be according to the thickness of the tubes, and a little more thick, and let there be a uterus in which medicines are put from animal bladder: or from paper ear, which should be according to the shape of half an asphodel root: whose root will be one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it is pierced through with many holes as it has been rotated, and there must be space which is the thickness of a finger between every hole.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert a strong thread made from raw yarn into those holes, which should be made from ten threads or roughly that many, and bind it with the uterus like an asphodel.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When placing the uterus in it, tighten it at the top with the clamps between two distinguishing constrictions strongly.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then perform enemas with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle depicted here and the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the enema when using this is as follows: you should fill it with a medicine from the bladder or uterus, which must be heated according to the quantity that the sick can tolerate. And beware not to make it overly hot or overly cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient is made to lie on his back, and raises his legs to the upper side; and place under him a pad, that is, skin upon which people are lying, or a sheet.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then immerse the extremity in a bath of turpentine mixed with oil, or with albuginea, or with fennel mucus, or something similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then have the attendant bear him up with his two hands at the same time, and press him until he vomits completely what is in the suppository in the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the suppository, and raise the patient's legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine intends for him to pass (the contents), then hold as much as he can bear.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if it causes sleep through that whole night, it is more beneficial for improvement.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If the suppositories cause discomforts of the belly's solution and hasten its exit: then repeat the suppositories until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or injured parts near the anus, then use suppositories very gently and mildly, using those suppositories that are used for children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is to be the shape of the thin suppository on which there is tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	¶ On the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken about the division of the treatment of wounds within the book and I will now discuss their treatment with hands and medicines according to completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore, I say that wounds are distinguished according to how they occur and according to the place upon which they fall.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, as to the wounds produced by these many things, they are like a stone's impact: or by cutting with a sword, or a knife: or by hitting with a spear, or wood, or an arrow: and similar actions from many other objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that occur according to the location of the body are like a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or loins, and similar wounds from those parts.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am the narrator of treatments for certain wounds, to place that reasoning and rule above the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds, since the recall of compositions leads into the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of bone: then consider if it was due to being struck by a stone or something similar, and has only felled the skin; it is a large wound, and you should be fearful for its minor outcome with bleeding disorders. Then act quickly, apply a head phlebotomy immediately: do not delay this: extract from him according to the strength of his blood: if there is nothing prohibiting it from bloodletting, especially if the blood that flows out of the wound is very little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be taken from the opposite side of the wounded area.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And may the sick person beware of overfeeding himself, and of wine, and of heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If however there is something that prohibits reduction, then reduce it from food, and do not approach meats, nor wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place an hot poultice over the wound if it happens to him, soak it in rose oil or oil alone, or with wine that has astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you have safely cleared the wound of pus with a warm cautery, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and has not changed itself into air, the powder I will tell you after a little: and if it has already changed itself into air, then place on it some ointments until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large or comes from a cut made by a tool, and similar conditions apply: if its edges do not stick together due to pus, then you should join them with stitches according to what I will describe about wounds of the abdomen regarding their stitching.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the wound has already been found from bone and hangs down, and there is no retention of it except in a small retaining device: then cut into it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore flesh to it instead of skin. And instruct the sick person to eat food that is fattening such as heads and boiled wheat until they feel full, and similar items.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find decomposition in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut out the decomposed part completely, and remove it; then care for that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If however there is an artery or a vein from which blood flows in these wounds: and if it cannot be severed through medicine, then enquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find that it is not followed by coagulation, then cut or tie it with the help of an assistant.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity prompts when it does not allow what we said to occur, then apply the cautery until blood is released.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If these wounds are small and simple, then their treatment is easy and light, so grind this powder over them: because it hardens them before they change into air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The Method for the Surgical Treatment of Newborns.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe one part of olibanum, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of non-extinguished bones: it should be heated much, and sifted: and it should be filled with this into the wound, and tied with a good bandage until it adheres well over it and coagulates with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind him from above with grains, and release him, do not break him as long as he remains, so that he does not get loose.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine shall not be removed from him until he is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes it does that with the splint alone, when you don't have olibanum or dragon's blood available. And this same operation is performed in many large wounds, when it should be placed over them and bound up tightly while the wounds are fresh with their own blood which hasn't been disturbed by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	And if they have been disturbed by air in some way, especially when it is in the season of summer, then this mixture's purpose will not be in position: therefore take care with what we said, so you place over them some cooked ointments: or place over them poultices made from wheat flour mixed with water and honey until pus is discharged.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the rest of the treatment until they heal.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it happens that a fracture occurs in the bone and is small, then remove that with Gesti: and I will already have spoken about the treatment of skull fractures in what follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	The Treatment for Wounds to the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85: The Head
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If indeed a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in treatment method among itself and when it is simply a head wound.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If indeed the nerve of the neck has already been cut or an artery: then if it's a nerve, there isn't any skill unless proper treatment is done with what causes strong constriction like ligatures, and zinnias, and things similar to them.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm nerves and constrict them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold absolutely on the wound: for the substance of nerves is cold and their continuation is with the brain which is higher than any member; let that be used in healing according to medical remedies gently, like plaster mixed with sweet water occasionally with oil or with rose oil, and turmeric when it is washed even with sweet water: and all other mineral stones, in accordance with this manner, and greasy ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then apply stitches: or constrict its edges with powders.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the depth of the wound is deep or it happens that a sinus occurs in its lower part, where pus has already accumulated, then puncture it at a more depressed place in there.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	And if an artery has already been cut in the wound and there is a flow of blood from it, then separate it, or dry it out and tie it: or burn it with a cautery if necessity demands that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	And if the windpipe has already been cut, or even if it is entirely cut and the larynx has been saved, then gather together the edges of the skin with stitches above the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe itself, rather keep it in equilibrium, and place it back to its natural form.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten the bandage appropriately, and release him after several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then the treatment itself, involving ointments that have a bandaging and drying quality, continues until healing occurs.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If a wound has already made an impression in the bone, then explore it. If there are fragments of bone within it, extract all of them or as many that you can from them: and leave what cannot be prepared to heal until the wound has putrefied, and its egress is separated and cleaned out.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then powder it with the powder I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If it appears that the wound contains an opening into the mouth and forms a fistula, then treat that with him whose method is described in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	¶ On the wound in spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If the depth of a stab wound caused by a spear or a knife is visible, then you should assess it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore wind escapes from the wound when the sick person gasps for breath, then you know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If there is no depth to the wound and it is recent with his own blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor compress it, so that the blood does not get trapped in the depths of it and return to the heart and kills him: but apply a drawing ointment to it, and let it be applied twice in a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if the ointment is not available to you, then put in a used wick in the wound opening, so that it draws out what comes out of it from the moistures: and make him sleep on the wound, so that it heals what accumulates in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	But if three days or more have passed since the wound occurred and no sickness has befallen him, nor a bad heart tremor, nor constriction during gasping, and you see his other conditions good: then you know that the wound is healing.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore take care of it yourself and with permissions, and continue the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If recovery is not justified and it always opens up again, then you will know that a fistula has already been formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore take care of it according to its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if there is a wound from an incision by the tool of a razor or a knife, and it is simple in the surface of the chest or back: then take care of it according to what preceded from suture, if it's large; or with powder, if it's small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	And if it has already made an imprint into the bone and comes out from there fragments: then inquire about the wound, and proceed to remove those fragments if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If however they are not separated, then let them go, until the wound putrefies, for their extraction would cause harm.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment of other injuries on different limbs in treatment is the judgment we have stated.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Section: On wounds of the belly and exit of intestines, and their expulsion.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs in the belly can be large, medium, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From a large one, it is sometimes expelled, or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore there is an insertion of them and their suture is more intense and more difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And even the small disruption occurs in a more difficult manner due to another method.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten in its introduction to its place immediately: because it inflates, opens, and thickens: hence the difficulty of its introduction.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, for this reason a better disruption of the middle is done: because when that does not happen, reduction of the intestine becomes easier, unlike in those two cases.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that the stitching of wounds is done according to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common stitches apply to the abdominal wound and to other body wounds: and two other specific stitches are designed for other types of wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more specific for abdominal stitches: and I will tell you each one with its explanation and demonstration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I thus say, that when the wound is small and something from the intestine protrudes out of it, making its reduction difficult; then this corresponds to one of the two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or due to the difficulty of the rupture, as we said: Or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When this happens like that, then you need to warm it up so as to immerse the sponge, or a wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil them in water with reeds, hyssop, and garlic, and treat the intestine with that, until the inflation resolves.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	At times it performs one where there is an application of pressure, and it is better than just water alone in the resolution of inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When you see that the inflammation has already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water that has been boiled in it, or honey.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through this method the introduction of its contents becomes smoother when there is little matter present.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If the release of its contents is then relieved after this treatment, then perform a somewhat limited disruption, using the tool used for cutting hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	The first form of treatment is better when prepared than cutting: and there is no enforced compulsion for a second cut after need and lack of tools.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Take one part of it which is bent and pointed, and the other part is not sharp, and do not have a thin tip like that of Spatumilis, but make it slightly钝 instead. And see as you perceive, it resembles a thorn.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	So, when the wound expands and enters the intestines, then it is necessary that its reduction takes place according to its natural shape in its own place, if possible over that: for this is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	But when the disruption is large in the lower part of the abdomen: then it should be made that the patient lies on its back, and place its legs higher than its head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place its head and its body higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly, if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then direct your purpose and consideration always on this, so that the part where the wound is be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it should be that you administer this to large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In very small wounds, place the treatment according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then have a worthy attendant present between your hands who will hold the entire disruption with his hand and gather its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then remove from it for the one who follows in suture something after something, and this is the common method of suturing.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is that you take the point or number of points according to the size and extent of the wounds.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then from the end of the breakage, remove an amount equal to a digit, that is, for doctors: and hold one point with which you will introduce the thread into both ends of the skin, with two ends underneath the skin from the inside, until it penetrates from another part, and you have already connected the two ends of the skin, and two ends of the other thing: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with double thread around the tip of the needle from both sides at intervals, until two wounds are aggregated in appropriate union.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then remove the thickness of a digit again, and hold another needle point in them: afterwards draw it out with thread as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	So do not stop doing that with each one from the needles until you complete the closure of all wounds.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And the needles should be of medium size between thickness and fineness: because very fine needles pierce the flesh quickly; and thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin: therefore it must be that they have a medium size both in fineness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it should not happen that the needle gets caught very close to both ends of adjacent skin pieces; so as not to pierce the flesh quickly and open the wound before its own healing, and also not to stretch them even with suturing, lest the wound be prevented from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the ends of the needles so as not to hurt the patient during their sleep. And place them with small pieces of cloth from all sides on each end of the needle. Let them remain until you know that the wound has already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And indeed, this kind of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because for sewing them together one needle, or two, or about that number, will suffice.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second stitch is common, so that when the two ends of a wound are gathered together, they form four: two ends of skin and two ends of suture in opposition to one another. There should be a needle with thread rolled within it, of equal thickness and size.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Next, when you have penetrated with the needle those four ends, bring the needle back from the part where you started, so that the wound-up thread falls from the upper part of the wound: as it is when they sew cloth using a needle and string, and place throughout every stitch the thickness equivalent to less than a finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This stitch, however, humans know.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch I treated the wound that had happened to him on his belly, which he had received from being cut by a knife, and there was a larger disruption of the wound than one hand's width: and it protruded two hands' lengths from the intestines, from the middle intestine, and there was a disruption in the center of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Therefore I returned that which had protruded from his wound back into his intestine after it stood outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound thus healed within a space that was about fifteen days: and I treated it, and he was made well: and after that he lived many years, accustomed to his own arrangements.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians judged that it would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And by miracle, it was what wasn't treated with the balsam.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no balm could be found, nor anything from the physicians.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	So I placed on the wound twice a dried up lamb's wool each day, and did the constant washing of it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will now describe two kinds of suture peculiar to the craft according to the narrative of the discourse.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is like this when you start with a sharp suture: and you will insert the point from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	So when the needle penetrates the skin and enters the incision according to both the length and width of the entire body: remove the end of it, let's say on the side where you inserted the point, and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inner part towards the outer part at the other extremity.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	So when you make it penetrate like this at the same end towards the outer part and then to the inner: remove the end which is on that side. Then make the needle penetrate at another end from the inner part towards the outer part: and make it penetrate with the penetration you are making it penetrate in that other end, which is in its part, until it penetrates it entirely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then start again from this same side, and take out the needle from the skin which it has penetrated, with the end that is coming out from the other side of that part.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then return it to that skin and take out the other end which is on another side, with this end here. Take it out from the skin which is coming out from its part, and do this in turn like this one and the other. Do this alternately until you have returned its entire outer part according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	The summary of this stitch is like that for sutures of animal skins where they are leathers: thus you make the needle in turn from one part to the other end of the skin. And when you remove it alternately from one side to the other, until you finish.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of peculiar stitch, as Gale said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This statement about his speech is narrated in order to describe how some surgeons operate on them, so they gather all parts into a suitable match by nature: and they apply the end of one side against the other part of its own kind, and the end of future against another part of it.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You must fix the point in the nearest end to you from the outer part and make it penetrate into the inner side within that sole: and release the two ends of sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the point, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner side through both ends of sifac, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both of them, and also make each penetrate from the inner to the outer side until it reaches the other ends, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	This is the better method of suture compared to the common one, and it is the suture which follows a recollection.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This, then, is the words of Galen as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The abdominal suture is corrected with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	This means, you will introduce each of the threads one by one: and start when inserting the needle as you have it, make that penetrate until reaching another side, according to how those are sewn which are skin on an equal level.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you should know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suture is more difficult than those of other parts of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment on treatment for wounds is like the judgment for all other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	What is that, because when you take up a wound with its blood, before it cools off, and you bring back the intestine, and restore itself, and make it fit: then place it on powdered flesh.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already altered the wound: then place some ointments over it, which are available to you, until pus forms: and remove the threads, and heal them with new ones, and marvel.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for this as you would treat other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If however the medicines are not available to you, then immediately place over it whatever starts to emit pus from there. Use old wadding: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medications in various situations when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If however you fear that the wound communicates with major limbs in an injury, then it is necessary to immerse soft woolen cloth into oil at a temperate heat, or into rose oil: and place that in the area around the groin, and under the axilla.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If it feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this happens often), then cleanse it with an infusion of wine mixed with astringent herbs, black, warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached into the intestine and made a penetrating wound up to its cavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what comes from the larger intestine is easier to heal, and what comes from them from the finer one is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine which is called the Jejunum does not receive healing from any wound that happens in it at all: and this is because of its abundance, consisting of veins, and their largeness, and because of its subtle body, and proximity to nerve nature.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If what proceeds from the wound is hair and you have obtained it fresh, follow this: reduce it according to your method of reducing intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If however a period has elapsed from it and it has already turned green or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with thread above the place which was discolored by it, so that no blood flow occurs.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	Indeed in hair, veins and arteries are present.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut the ligament that is beyond it and place two hanging ends of thread from the lower part of the wound outside it. So that when you pull on its end above, and extract it in the case of hair, there will be a discharge from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remembrance of what happens to wounds in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When there is a disruption in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible for some people to heal. Therefore, because I have seen someone who was wounded in their abdomen with the thrust of a lance, and had an old wound from the right side of the stomach, and he made a fistula, and excretion came out of it, along with wind.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	So I took care of the treatment until I was not satisfied with his healing. I did not cease to investigate him until he was healed and the place had consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick man, that something bad might happen to him in his abdomen: and no bad events occurred to him from that.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in his better condition, eating and drinking, defecating, bathing in a bath and exercising in his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some of the experimenters said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and is small, then it should be tied according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is as if you were taking out the heads of great ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then join two lips to the wounds, and place one of the ants which have an open mouth on top of the two lips.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	So when he puts his head on top of it and tightens his mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with an ant after an ant according to the quantity of wounds.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then return it back, and heal his wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For the heads remain attached inside until he eats the intestines and is healed, and no harm befalls the sick person completely.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is possible that the intestine can be tied even with a fine thread: which is taken from the animal's intestine and attached to it after being inserted into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And you will take this end of the thread from the intestine, and much flesh will be removed.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie a fine, rolled linen thread at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the needle, and heal with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then return it to the disruption.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is nothing other than according to the path of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines: then there is no skill other than delicacy, and there is not its complete healing.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	¶ On the care of Zuchemen (Zucchemen) and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You should know that every sore, or pustule when it matures and becomes old, and turns into a ulcer, and does not heal, and always exudes pus, and is not removed: then it is universally called a fistula in any member wherever it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And indeed, a fistula is according to truth, a filtered nodation, hard, white: with which there is no pain, and it has the shape of a bird's feather: for that reason some people call it Risati, that is, a bird.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And there are certain times when it becomes wet, which exudes pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture splits or divides at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And this moisture can be abundant, and scarce: it can be coarse, or it can be fine.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already stated in the division that when I said wounds, every ulcer which does not heal and is not born within the flesh, this is not because of just one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of these causes is, either because there is little blood in the body: or due to its malice: or because between him and above his lips there is hard flesh which prevents birth of tissue: or because there are many sores and pus: or because the ulcer itself is putrid and what is sent to it has bad quality: or because medicine is inconvenient in treating it: or because decay falls into a region, which is a plague like happening in Caesarea: where difficult digestion of sicknesses occurs and healing of pustules is delayed by nature: or because there is one mouth or number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all of these causes and their signs, and the treatments with medicines in the division. And it should be noted here that you need to understand how to treat a fistula and Zuchen which happens through an operative procedure with hands.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Therefore, you should know that a fistula may occur in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	Therefore, there are fistulas which reach to the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinuses: or to the intestines, or bladder, or some part of the ribs: or to some part of the thoracic vertebrae, or to some part of a compound structure made up of joints: such as the hands, and feet: and among these are those which tend towards the neighborhood of the main member, and their like.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, among these fistulas, this one follows this manner: it is from ailments which are difficult to heal and do not accept treatment, and when there is an occupation with that, the effort and ignorance are present.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	And if it is from some fistulas whose depth does not reach the places that I said: and you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to come to know about it, then take a trial with air or iron, if the fistula extends according to rectitude, and seek it out along with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	And if there is tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with an attempt using fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead, due to its softness, is absorbed by the body and conforms around the tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	And if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to describe it with a trial.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	So cleanse from there an opening from its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you cleanse it, directs the flow of other openings and flows out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully inquire according to the manner that is possible for you: so you may know whether there is a hole or nerve, and whether it is the concavity of the fistula far away or near. Or if there is one fistula with many openings and you stand over all this with your utmost strength: through your questioning about the sick person, and the discovery of pain upon compression on that place by your hand, and similar interpretations and causes of such events.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When therefore you stand on all that true station, then go to treatment according to confidence: and it is that you should consider then if a Fistula appears near, or in a place saved remotely from the junction, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of those places which I told you about; then cut the Fistula according to what has been given as instruction from my narrative, and take out whatever is in it from filtration, and rotten flesh, which is born in its opening from flesh, or pus, and similar things: and care for that until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If the Fistula is remote and deep, and follows straightness: then it must be cut within as far as possible to you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse that from all its rotten flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer licorice that is rolled up in the medicines of the acute: and insert them until you reach the hollowed-out part of the fistula which you comprehended with iron: do it with these things repeatedly, until the medicine of the acuteness corrodes completely all that remains in the hollow part of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore her with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until she is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If however it does not heal through this, then burn her according to what we have told.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If therefore the cause of the fistula is the mouth, and it is confirmed to you thus: then inquire about it, and cut it according to what I have told you: if nothing prevents you from anything through a vein, or nerve, or main member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore the mouth is discovered to you, and there is something of corruption and darkness within it: then shave it off until the entirety of its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it together with what has been grafted onto it until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal and discharges pus as before, then you will know that your complete eradication of the corruption has not been achieved.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	So clean it off with something else secondly, and examine it closely, and complete its purification with your final strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it then heals, that is good; and if not, then you will know that that corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore, you do not have the ability for it in such matters, unless to let nature itself dispose of it.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the affected area is the mouth that is too small and it is possible for you, draw it in with fine forceps that are suitable for this task.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones though, then you should examine the attraction of all of them carefully, and do not let anything go from them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If something from the moisture opposes you and there is no fear or mistake about making an incision on them: then cut out those moist substances and flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If however there is no preparation for removing bones from your time, then place over the wound that which will rot it: and remove it until the decomposition reaches what is within the circumference of those bones in flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not harden.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And bind the section you made during your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Instead, put over it (the wound), if you fear, sulfur ground and mixed with oil: or the tip submerged in an Egyptian ointment, or any green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those putrid humors do exist and separate from them bones, their removal should be performed and also the attraction of these.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	And if there is a large mouth like the thigh hole or the hip joint and similar things, and what has decayed from it is a large part of it: then shave it until the final reason, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then heal the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	And if what has decayed in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to file it down completely until one reaches the point where the corruption arrived. Then take care of it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I will tell you about what happens to the patient in his leg: use it as an example and a guide for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man about thirty years old, who experienced pain in his leg. This occurred due to the movement within him inside the body, that is, from the interior parts, up until the material reached the knee, and an abscess formed: and it was not an external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, time has extended with the error of the doctors until the abscess opens, and there is a large amount of matter coming together with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after the treatment until the knee becomes a tunnel, and many holes are made in it: all of which were emitting pus and bodily humors.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore, a multitude of doctors treated him for about two years, and there was no skillful person in the art until I was called and saw his knee and the large flow coming out of those holes; indeed, all his body had already turned yellow, and his color was pale.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore, an attempt at introduction is made in one place of the openings, and the attempt reached the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I thoroughly examined all openings; and found them to come to each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Therefore, I proceeded, and followed through one of those openings until I found the part of the bone; and I found it decayed: which was already corroded, had decayed, stunk, and perforated, until it penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Therefore, I chiseled what was found to me, and prepared from the decayed bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I placed it, that which was not part of the bone but that decay, which I chiseled and removed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already uprooted that.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then, I placed the restoration with lengthwise consolidated medicines to heal the wounds.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it has not been consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I attempted it again and found a second opening above the first detection; and I found continuous decay with the bone: and I chiseled what appeared to me even from that decay.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then, I attempted to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it has not been restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I then discovered it again above that one, and did not cease to penetrate the mouth specifically, trying to restore it. And it was not restored until I penetrated from the bone about a palm's width, and extracted it along with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed. There was no need for this repetition of the operation and section on him, except due to his debilitated condition, limited tolerance, and fear for his life: since he experienced maladies from excessive urination fits at all times.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	The healing is therefore complete healing: and the wound is formed at the site of the bone's flesh, and good arrangement has been made within its body, and his strength returns: and he has adapted to his conditions: and it did not cause him any harm in walking; entirely no damage.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If the elevated mouth in the place of the body is already broken: then it must be that you sew it, according to this manner: and it is: take the ligament, and tighten it at the end of the projecting bone: and command someone, who extends it upwards: and put another ligament made of thicker wool thread on the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then sew it over the flesh which is at the mouth of the bone: and extend its end so that you take flesh downwards: and you lay flesh over the place where you wish to saw, so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood or a slab beneath the bone below: because when you do this, it is not prevented that it dries out the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it must be that the saw is over the place of corruption just enough, so that there is not a depression due to the corruption in the bone: and it does not appear in its appearance by sense, and compels it through her means instead of others towards the use of her own saw.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the mouth is corrupted and is not elevated, rather a part of it continues with its part: and corruption is in the middle of it, or in a part of itself: then take flesh from all parts completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then saw that from the first part where there is corruption until it continues on the other side. And make the sawing according to the length near the corruption as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut off that damaged joint and saw through where it continues on the other side of the mouth.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If there is corruption in the continuity of two ligatures, then there is no ingenuity except for abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If corruption is found in the fingers' ligature or in the ligature of the foot: then it is very difficult to deal with that.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But you must inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And remove the abrasion, and cleanse it according to any possible arrangement for you, and correct it with whatever ingenuity suits you: when it does not oppose you against the vein, or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you will know that the incisors and saws are needed for these bones in large amounts, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their fineness, their size, their smoothness, their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare the appropriate tool for each type of operation suitable for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And you will know that these operations indicate to you the type of tool you need for them when your study is extensive.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the methods of this art is evidence of the severity of its methods: then you will indeed find for yourself what suits it from the tools to all illnesses.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I will stand firm with you at the end of this chapter on the number of tools, which you place as examples upon which you strike and test through experience on others.
Forma Serrae.	The form of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of yet another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This depiction of the saw's form, let it be correctly made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Make it an upper arch, its sharpness from iron: and its handle from boxwood, and let it be pyramidal asymmetrically made.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the razor for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor have the shape of a star-shaped nail: and let its points be according to the shape of the points of an escutcheon.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable unless they rub against its heads when the joints are corrupted, or against a wide and large mouth.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the medium-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the wide-bladed razor.

Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Also, the large razor's form.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw: it is exhibited in many places according to the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the razor that conforms to its ratio which is perforated from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, and it has sharp extremities.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, it should be that all things which we said about razors, cutters, and saws are made.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Section on making cuts to extremities, and the locking of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities decompose, either from an external cause or from an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	So when you have treated that corruption with medical remedies, and the treatment does not agree: and you see corruption occurring in a member, which is unaffected by anything: then it must be that you proceed to that member until where the consequence of corruption follows, so that the sick person may escape death through this, or from malice which is greater than the defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that this occurs is when the member deteriorates until it seems like it; which was burned by fire or rotted after becoming black: until that corruption spreads to that which follows that member and weaves its way through the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, when it comes to cutting into that [affected] part, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from striking by some venomous creatures: such as sea scorpions, snakes, vipers, and similar.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	So if the corruption, or striking, is in the end of a finger, then cut the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption, so it will proceed up to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut that from the root of the palm, and do not leave space for the corruption, until it reaches into the palm of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades there, then cut the arm at its elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	And if the corruption passes through and you see it around the elbow: then there is death for the sick person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that with healing, is the quantity of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do this with a foot, when corruption invades a toe, then cut it at the joint of one. And if it reaches up to the heel bone, then cut the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If it ascends to the knee, then at the joint of the leg you will cut.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no art in that case, except for discharge and leave the disabled to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of applying or gripping the limb, or tightening it, is to tighten the ligament below where you wish to apply: and then tighten another ligament above that place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let the assistant extend one ligament downwards: and let the other assistant extend another ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is revealed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then cut or tighten it.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it must be that you lay the linen cloth on from all parts and does not touch the healthy area with the scalpel: and let there be a wound added to the sick person, and apply a hot poultice.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If however there should occur an internal flow of blood while you are operating, then quickly cauterize the area: or place some blood-letting powders on it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until completion.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the wounded limb with the corresponding ligament and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I will tell you what happens to him in his foot, this is the same event that I am telling you about.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What happens is that a blackness occurs in his foot, akin to the effect of burning by fire: and this corruption first happens in his toe until it spread throughout his entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	He treated himself therefore after he saw the corruption advancing into his limb with the decay of him, which he found from his pain and burning: and it affected him at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time has passed for him, the same decay occurs in his index finger of his own hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	So he came to me, and I tried to restore that excess with what I had placed over his hand after applying medicines for the purification of his body: the excess did not return, but began to spread to another finger; until decay started to occur on his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He therefore called me to cut his hand: but I did not agree to that, hoping for a response from him about the return of that excess; and I was also afraid that he might die at the cut of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the strength of the man was above the situation.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	So when he had given up hope of me, he returned to his land: and news reached me from him because it was close, and he cut off his entire hand: and he was cured.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not omit this narrative, except as an aid to understanding what falls under this type of illness, and as a representation by which it is understood, and according to which it is handled.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Section on the care of sinuses, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Caput XC.	Title 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in some fatty parts of the body and stretches out its space until it forms pus: then when it is drained or punctured, and what was inside comes out from the pus, leaving a vacuous place as if there were a container: and the skin above it behaves like a woven fabric that has now been finely woven. It does not proceed to the final stage of corruption, nor spreads into the mouth, nor into the nerves, nor into the ligaments. It deserves to be named Sinus: but is not called Fistula. However, if its space stretches out until it spreads the corruption into one of these membranes, then it is named as Fistula or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is for you to cut that skin completely as it would be peeled off: and especially when it has been made thin like a cloth; and trust that it won't adhere with the place because of its decomposition.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If you hope it will adhere to the skin and does not follow that final corruption: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then take care with Clister: and it is what you should consider towards the Breast.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large and the pus that flows from it has a foul odor: then use clister with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and zinnia, taking equal parts, they are mixed together in a pot: and they are boiled over fire until the medicine turns red: and it becomes like honey in thickness.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take what you need from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and use the clister with it on the Breast: and tighten its opening, and release the medicine into it up to the amount of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression: do this for days until the Breast is cleansed, and remove the smell.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes you can use clister with ashes water when this medicine is not available to you: and it is that you take the ash of vine wood or the ash from oak woods: and place the water on it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then heat her up, and use the clister with it until you're sure that the Breast has been cleaned.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the weak cannot bear the Egyptian medicine or the ashes water, then use the clister with water and honey, which already has a little of ground zinnia mixed in.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or use the clister with honey and wine mixed, because of the properties of honey it cleanses and washes away: and wine makes the Breast adhere, especially when there is excess of coagulation and drying in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do this repeatedly, and you trust that the corruption sinus is already removed: then irrigate him with what causes flesh to be born in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And this is how you receive it from the plaster of dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose oil, and wine that is tight-stoppered: or irrigate it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I wrote about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	And if the Sinus orifice is narrow and doesn't accept the tube of the enema, then widen it with iron gently: or place a rolled piece of linnen in it coated with Egyptian ointment, or in basil ointment, until it gets wider.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly, if the orifice is even wide, then gather its lips together with suture: and extract from it an amount that can accept enema without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly, if the orifice from which pus flows is elevated above the rest, then dry it in a lower place within it so that it can drain pus down to below. Because when pus is constrained deep inside the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated there.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus somewhat below its level as you wish: then try preparing the limb with a preparation that facilitates the drainage of pus from it, according to how you are prepared.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to ensure nothing is retained within it from the pus at all: and take the consolidating medicines that are placed above the sign, compatible with what you desire.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a size that it can communicate with all of the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	And then cut into the direct opening of the sinus hole with forceps, more than the sinus opening gently.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then, extend from the ointment strips onto the cloth another one, according to the size of the hole: and place it over it in a long position away from the sinus opening, so that pus can exit through it: and do not remove the large piece of cloth until after a few days once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	That one which is over the Sinus opening, that one you remove at all times to see what comes out from it due to pus. And by this means you will know whether that which flows out of it is much or little; whether it's well digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And after this, again examine the location of the Sinus, whether the owner feels pain in it or there is no pain, and whether there is a boil in it or there is no boil.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	Therefore, when your treatment is applied like this, and you see the substance coming out over the Sinus opening, then you will know that the Sinus has already adhered, or is approaching adherence. Therefore, then resolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you resolve the wound, then change another piece of cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If however pus comes out from the Sinus over a long space finely, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching. For there are people among humans who delay the growth of flesh in their wounds, and from them come those who act contrary to him.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If however pus that is undigested comes out from the Sinus over many days, then you will know that the Sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If thus adherence of the Sinus is delayed and prolongs its course: then add to drying medicines, but let the doctors do this such that the medicine itself becomes wet in its substance and dry in its power: like the unguent of dyafinicon, when an excess addition is added to it from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from this final part of what is treated, it is that you take the unguentum dyafinicon and dissolve it with rose oil, and let wine of old age be applied to its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix that with it, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And similarly performs this operation when you do not have the presence of dyafinicon ointment, honey, when you decoct it until it thickens and uses it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind all of it together, and spread the ground substance over honey while it is on fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then pour it over the substance, and bind it on the skin: and pour over it the honey that you have decocted, until it thickens: then grind the mixture and spread it over the substance, and place a piece of cloth over it and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes it is administered with long aristolochia and the roots of celestial lily, and there is the lily: and herb flour, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them in their simples or combined forms, grind these and sift them: and spread the ground substance over the honey that I have mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the condition of the Sinus extends and is not cured by this method, then you will know that there is a deep corruption within it. Or perhaps it has caused an impression in the bones or other hard parts, or ligaments: then treat it with the methods for Fistular (a type of surgical procedure), as was previously stated.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	### On the treatment of Panaritis (a type of inflammation), and rubbing of nails, and insertion into a finger, and cutting.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritis is an abscess that develops under the thumb nail or foot toe nail, and perhaps it may develop in other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When thus the condition of his thing extends, and care for its treatment is neglected, and it's treated with an application of heat: or if it gets spoiled, and pus is emitted, until the root of the nail rots: and perhaps it spoils her completely, and perhaps the corruption reaches to the mouth until there becomes a foul smell in him: then the end of the finger broadens, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When then you care for it, when we mentioned this in division and your care does not match up with that: then one must strike through completely with the iron what has remained of the excess from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then after this, cauterize the wound.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Indeed, an iron cauterizer is very useful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If however the bone is healthy, and there is even a nail intact, and the hollow parts of the nail are already pressing into the flesh towards the inside, and begin to sting it and hurt it: then you must place a fine piece of iron under the angle of the nail which stings the flesh, and push it up. Then cut that flesh with ease, and place what remains of the burned flesh from the medicaments over it until it is all removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If corruption has already spread into the mouth, then you must cut that mouth and remove it; for a rotten mouth never heals.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and decay advancing into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to what was previously mentioned as a reminder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If it happens by scratching of the nail or impact: and there is a pain intermittently, then one must use a weak bloodletting first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp Spatulum instrument crossing from top to bottom.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And take care, so that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the patient through this and it will be a cause of an increased amount of flesh growing in that spot.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then take care of the site with what soothes pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	But the finger that grows in some human hands may be entirely fleshly. Perhaps there are bones in some of them. And perhaps there is a nail in it. Some of them grow at the junction root or its natality may be in certain joints of fingers.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	The one that is born at certain joints of the finger does not move: and the one that emerges near the junction of the finger may perhaps move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Thus, for the one among them that is fleshly, its cutting is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	This means: so when you encounter it at its root with the broad Spatulum tool.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	The treatment for which arises in the junction's root, is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	So refrain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In the one that grows at the end of the joints in the finger, then you must cut into the first flesh with a round incision up to the mouth.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then scrape the opening with one of those small scraping tools suitable for that task.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	Recovery that happens between digits one by one occurs multiple times either from the birth of man, meaning it is born with him, or from the healing of wounds, or from burning by fire and similar incidents.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore it must be that separation of this consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them lice or cloths soaked in rose oil; so that they do not congeal quickly and separate them. Or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the affected area has consolidated according to what is required.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	Similarly, if there is consolidation involving some fingers with the palm, then dry off that consolidation according to how it is prepared and suits the figure of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	### On Cutting [Surgery]
Caput XCII.	Title XCII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are numerous veins that are involved, large, full of superfluities of melancholy which occur in many parts of the body: and most of their events are in the legs, particularly in the legs of those walking, working, and bearing load.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary that you perform the body's bleeding from black bile with strong bleeding on occasion.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then use the phlebotomy on the patient for this basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	However, the treatment of these with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is, let it be taken up, and the black blood be extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is to remove the vein, and extract all of it.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	However, its section is according to this manner.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First immerse the leg up to the knee with warm water for quite some time until the thick and fatty blood resolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tighten the leg at the upper part of its thigh towards the lower part of the knee with the aid of a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein at one, two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Next raise, that is, draw the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top. And it must be necessary for this purpose for a phlebotomist on the upper side first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail up to the bottom: until an amount of blood that you see is sufficient and which the strength of the patient can bear has flowed out.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then tie that part: and instruct him not to eat anything that generates black bile. And repeat the evacuations and phlebotomy when the veins are filled up and it is harmful for the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of it is according to this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Wound the inside of the weak knee, if there are many hairs there.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce this into the bath: or immerse it in his legs with warm water until the veins redden and swell. Or, if there is no present bath, exercise him with vigorous activity until the member warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Next, remove the skin directly along the line of the vein by cutting longitudinally: or at its last part near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Next, open the skin with pincers, and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears to your senses: and at its appearance you will see that it reddens as it darkens.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When the vein thus runs out through the skin, you will see it white as if it were a chord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce the probe under it until when it elevates and emerges from the skin: hang it with a blind, gentle hook.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Next, cut another section close to that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Next, elevate it with the probes as you did before, and hang it with another hook as you did first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Next, cut another section or more sections if you need them.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then elevate it and with the last section, cut into it at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Next, remove it up to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that until you extract it from the upper section or with all higher sections until when it completely emerges: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you to extract or elevate it, then insert a sharp needle with a strong double thread and tie it, and pull it out. Or if that fails, insert the rod beneath it, and move your hand over all parts until it goes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be cautious, so as not to penetrate too far.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if you do penetrate too far, it will make the extraction of that thing very difficult for you, and it causes damage to the weak one from there.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	So when you have extracted it completely: then place over the wound a piece of cloth soaked in wine and rose oil, or just oil, and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	And if it's contracted, having a twist causing inversion to parts, and it is not as we said according to straightness: then you must fix over it to all parts of its twistiness, and the sites of that inversion.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you lift it completely: and be cautious near your section line not to pierce or wound her, for it will become difficult for you either to lift or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	So keep your caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The Form of the Incident on Healing Vine.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The Form of the Blind Knot.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not treated in the same way as other knots, nor does it have a sharp end that could pierce blood vessels: and it has a large bending, being soft. Because if it were fine, the vessel would be pierced by its thinness; indeed, it has superfluous bulkiness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the Extraction of the Calf Vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the limbs on warm lands, such as Alzagi, and the land of Arabs, and on dry, warm, thinly fertile lands; that is, those in which no grass nor tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it might be generated in other parts of the body besides the limbs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	Indeed, its generation is from corruption that happens under the skin, just like it happens within snakes and roundworms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of this vein's outcome is that inflammation suddenly occurs in the limbs.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then, the area gets filled with pus.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then, the vein begins to emerge from that area of pus, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore the end of it appears from that, then you must suspend over it a piece of lead of which the weight is equivalent to half a Keil-drachma, up to two drachmas and mark this point: and remove the suspended lead from the limb.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore something comes out of it to the external part, mark that on lead and make a mark for this.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it extends greatly, then cut off its part and mark the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut into it deeply before all of it has come out.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut too deeply, it will contract and penetrate into the flesh. And this causes a boil to occur and decay in the area, leading to an evil ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore, it must be handled gently and extracted gradually until the very end of it comes out, so that nothing remains from it in the body: and this particular vein extends to a length of five palms and ten in some people.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it reaches me, for a man's discharge is from twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	And if you happen to be struck during your time of medication: then insert the needle into its opening and puncture it through that opening longitudinally, together with the body, until everything from the material inside is evacuated: and apply putrefaction treatment at the site along with medicines for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	And then attend to the treatment of blisters afterwards.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein often has many branches, particularly when it appears at the ankle joint, or within the foot itself: and it has many openings, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	So treat that part as we have said in the division, and together with what was already mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	¶ Concerning the removal of worms generated under the skin, it is called Boil Agitation.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This condition is called the Boil Agitation in a certain region among us: because it happens frequently to oxen, and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it travels throughout the body, rising and falling: and it becomes evident to perception during its movement from limb to limb, until it breaks wherever it breaks into skin, and comes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its production is from the pus of some body fluids.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just like how worms and snakes, that is, roundworms and hookworms, occur in the intestines.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its maleficence.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it travels through the body and rises to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it opens in him and comes out, and destroys an eye: and this happens frequently.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When then you wish to treat him and extract it, this is done only at his walking, and manifestation to his sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	So it is necessary that you tie what is above him and what is below with a strong bandage together.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it goes deep into the flesh and you do not find it: then put a cauterizing iron over the place until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And what is feared as greater is its corruption that spoils his eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	And if you see that it has already penetrated to the head near the eye, then bind below it a good eyebrow constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary to use the sick purification of his body with medicines that dissolve bad putrid fluids.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Section regarding the sickness of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter XC (Ninety).
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This sickness is called Nakir in our land: and it is pain that occurs in certain limbs, then changes from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And indeed I have seen this myself, as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to attend a woman who is sick in some areas.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she showed me her arm, and I saw a slight swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I stayed there for an hour, I saw one swelling move with a stick, like a worm moving, ascending to her shoulder faster than it can be: as silver liquid when it runs from one place to another.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain therefore leaves that place and settles in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then sit for an hour, and run throughout the rest of the body, until it reaches another part of the arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	He then told me that he was revolving within his entire body, as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was therefore amazed by the speed of its permutation from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed, before this, I had not seen this illness so much by my eyes in such a manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who find pain to be changing from one limb to another: and I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that this is other than due to the fact that she was one of those from whom dry body veins are detected: hence it appears, by sense, that that windiness has been changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reasoning in those who are delightful and have moist bodies, whose veins are hidden.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you seek to cure his illness, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is visible to you as we said, then bind above it, and below it quickly: and cut above it, until that constricted windiness escapes: and cauterize the area.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If however you do not see it with your eyes: then attend to it along with the removal of the body, and that which drives away winds, and smother these with stinking pills, and pills made from serpentine, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	¶ On the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Title XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are differentiated according to their types and the locations from which they fall out of the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their variety is as follows: among them are those that have large points and small ones; concave ones, and blunt-tipped ones.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are those which have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are those which have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those that fall according to the parts of the body where they hit are divided into two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or, the limbs are from the main body parts which are concave, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	So when it falls into any of these body parts and you see the signs of death that I tell you about later, then you should know how to extract that arrow from them, for death follows it wherever it is found, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when you do not see these bad signs and the arrow is not hidden deeply within the member, then extract it, and take care of the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	From the signs when an arrow falls into the brain and penetrates the mouth, and emerges through the siphon above the brain, are: for accidents often happen from that such as fever, blindness, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, cramps, confusion, and vomiting bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood may come out through the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech may be lost, and the voice destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And from the place of wounds, a white moisture is discharged resembling cream.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there issues forth something similar to bodily moisture.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore you perceive these signs, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: it is close to the left nipple; and feels as if it is stuck firmly in something hard, not in a hollow.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the movement of an arrow is like the movement of a pulse: and it flows out of the wound black blood.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And this follows, the coldness of extremities, and cold perspiration, and intermittent fever.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	So you know that death is certain to occur.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it pierces the lung is the discharge of foamy blood from the wound: and the symptoms that follow are choking, and the complexion changes to that of a sick person.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a large amount of air, high up: and he seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	And if the arrow falls into the pleura, which is in the chest: then it's near to the thin ribs: and there is a great gasping breath with intense pain, with sighing: and all the shoulder joints move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested will be discharged from the wound with food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the abdomen and is stuck there: something like feces or a wad, or an intestine that has already been ruptured will be discharged from the wound.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope for his treatment, nor for extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If an arrow falls into the bladder and urine flows out: and something proceeds from it to the external parts, and makes the pain greater than the weakness: then you will know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, spatula (a term used for parts of the body), assistant bones, vertebrae, forks (possibly referring to anatomical structures like joints or ligaments), thigh and similar parts are diagnosed according to multiple dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery, or a nerve: and there is no poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I will tell you what I have seen about these arrows, so that you may understand through this in regard to your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	This is because some men, an arrow has fallen into the lacrimal sac of their eye, and at the base of their nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	So extract it yourself from the other side, under the skin of his ear: and he will be healed, and nothing harmful happens to him in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And he extracted another arrow for the Jew, which fell into the fatty tissue of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not find anything from it except a small part of its tip, with which it sticks to his own wood: and this arrow was large among arrows from the Turcoman bows, made of soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	So the Jew was healed, and nothing harmful befalls his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of the Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arab arrow, and that is the kind which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I followed it between two guides: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I have skillfully extracted her with care until she was freed: and the Christian is healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from him which had penetrated into his abdomen: and we thought he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	So after thirty days had passed for him and nothing changed from his condition according to his dispositions, I pursued the arrow: and I devised a plan over it, then extracted it: and he was healed, and no harm befell him afterwards.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and a scar was formed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	And after seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her abdomen, and a scar was formed over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and nothing changed from her condition according to her dispositions, and the woman did not find any harm in herself with any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, to whom an arrow had fallen into his face: and the scar became consolidated, and remained, not finding much pain from it: and similar things happened many times.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted the arrow from the King's official, which had fallen into the middle of his nose and was already moving towards the right side slightly: and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore called to treat him after the case of the arrow up until three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the scar from the arrow to be tightly bound.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I examined it carefully with a gentle touch and did not feel anything. Indeed, he himself was experiencing pain under his ear from the right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	Therefore, I hoped that that point was from the extremity of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	Therefore, I plastered the place with a plaster containing a magnetizing and digestive property, trusting that the spot would be treated, and a sign of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could cut above it: and no accident occurred in the place indicating that the arrow had followed the spot.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	So I diligently treated it with plaster for many days: and no incidents occurred, and the wound hardened in the meantime: and it remained ill from its removal for a space of days, until he felt an arrow on a certain day within his own nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	So I applied for many days an acute, corrosive medicine to it, until it opened: and when I tried it again, and felt a subtle point of the arrow adhering inside the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the incision with that acute medicine until we could clearly see the tip of the arrow. And it took me about four months to complete this process.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound had enlarged and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move them without compliance towards exit: then I didn't stop using skill and devise methods with mechanical devices until that certain day when forceps were made at an appropriate size, according to their shape reaching the tip of the head, when I was able to extract it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed doctors judge that the nasal cartilage is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	So I restored it, and the wound hardened and was healed with complete health; nothing at all harmed it.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you about the quality of extraction of certain arrows: that you might place this rule and explanation above what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this craft and distinctions of them are not included with its narration: nor does this book include that, and a skilled artisan compares it with little to many: and with what is present, above that which is absent: and he discovers a new operation, and a new tool among descending phenomena of this craft when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	Therefore I say that arrows do not leave the parts to which they are attached, except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or through attraction from the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or against the other side of the part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which leaves from where it entered, whether it is the arrow proceeding in a fleshly place: and it is drawn and leaves.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	And if it does not conform to the exit from the time when it falls: then you must let it go for a few days, until the flesh around it decomposes. And his attraction will be relieved, and its departure.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is stuck in bone and does not comply with your exit, then let it go for a few days as well. And try it every day with its attraction and movement until it leaves.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	And if it does not comply with you for exit after days, then you must bore around the area of the arrow in the bone from all sides with a fine drill until the arrow expands.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw her and extract her.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the arrow is fixed in the head bone, and has already proceeded into one of the brain cavities, and shows certain symptoms that I mentioned; then refrain from the attraction of the arrow, and let it go until its condition equates to this after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow has reached the lung, then death does not prolong itself for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, unless within bones of the body only and does not penetrate to the lung: and he remains sick for a few days, and nothing happens to him from those events: then his abilities are tested by the action of the arrow and its removal.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	And if it is deeply fixed and does not obey you to your attempt of removal: then administer arrows around the area of the arrow as I instructed you: afterwards take care of the wound until he is healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	And if the arrow has already been removed from the body and hidden from sight: then seek it out with your attempts.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	And if you feel it, then draw it out with certain tools that suit its removal.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	And if you cannot reach it over it due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow deep inside: and there is no opening, or nerve, or vein there: then wait until the wound enlarges and becomes possible for extracting the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	And if there are ears that hold it, then free the fixed flesh in them from all sides using every tool you can and any means possible. If this is not possible without causing an issue with the movement of flesh during fragmentation of the ears or twisting of them until it becomes manageable.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of the arrow in any place, then use the twisting motion of your hand with forceps to all parts until it is made to come out: and using the most subtle method possible so that the arrow is not broken, making its removal difficult both for you and by you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	And if you cannot remove it in one attempt, then let it be for a few days until what is around it decomposes.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat this: if the operation eases the ailment. But if the blood flow contradicts you, then administer what we said from treatment in his chapter: and keep your strength away from the cut of a vein, or nerve, or chord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer the skill in every way possible that helps you aim the arrow: and let it be with ease, and calmness, or slow speed, and strength, as I told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And you must do when pulling the arrow as it is weak according to the figure, according to how it was with the case of the arrow itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if it is not possible for you to do that, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	And the arrow that emerges from the opposite part of the other side, or begins to move towards it something on the outside: or creates a protuberance at the tip of the arrow through sensation from the upper part of the nearby skin, and you see it protruding: cut it above it, and make the cut according to the amount that can be taken with the forceps.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it: for indeed it becomes easy for removal.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow imprints in the bone and expands for itself: then pull it.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: let her go for days: then repeat this until she emerges.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	And if the arrowwood is in it, then push it with her.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the wood falls and you are unable to administer a push: then insert that tool into it until its concavity enters into the tip of the arrow. Then push her with him.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the arrow is concave, then push it with the tool entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	The sagitta is understood through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned, then you must, if possible, hollow out all the flesh in which the poison is: if that is within your capability.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it according to what is suitable for this matter.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow falls in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or on the side, and it touches close to what you touch with your probe, and cutting it off is possible for you: then cut it, and remove from the incision of the vein, or nerve, and pull out the arrow.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then heal the wound if you see it, and take care of that until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of pincers used to extract arrows.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Their ends are similar to the beak of a bird, which is made like iron: when they grasp over the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	Many kinds of them are made, large and small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its sharpness, and the depth of the wound, and the constriction around it.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of the impelling tool which is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the impelling tool for the deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is like the end of a staff for a deaf person, so that it can be inserted into the concave arrow and pushed along with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The end of the tool for pushing concave arrows is like a feather, so that it can be inserted into the arrow and pushed forward.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	On Bloodletting Through Veins.
Caput XCVII.	Head 97.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	For bloodletting through veins, which is practiced within the body, there are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of which in the head are sixteen: two jugular veins which are behind the ears and are called 'the twos'; and two arteries that become apparent at the two temporal points; and two veins which are at the two nasal lacrimal points of both eyes, they are called 'the observers'; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead: and a vein which is at the extremity of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two Guidages, which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins that are in the upper lip.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins that are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins that are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	The veins which are used for bloodletting in the arms are five veins in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is the Cephalic vein, and it comes from the side of the axilla: and they call this common the head vein.
Et Fusca.	And the Dark One.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And the Middle vein, and it is composed of the Basilica branch and the Cephalic branch: and they call this common the body vein.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	And the Basilica vein, and it is placed in the inner side: and it is also called Tinnitus.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	And they call this common the belly vein.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And the Brachial cord, and it is placed above the elbow: that is the one where bloodletting takes place, and that is the one which appears above the thumb in an obvious manner.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And the Saluatella: and it is a vein that is between the ring and the smallest finger: and there are two branches to it.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	And there are three veins in the thigh and in the foot.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	One of them is which is under the thumb curve coming from the lateral side of the thigh.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	And the second one is the Saphenous vein: its location is at the heel, coming from the domestic lateral side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	And the Nesse vein: its location is at the heel on the lateral side of the thigh.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And there are three veins like those in the thigh elsewhere.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	Regarding bloodletting, two veins after the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	For bloodletting, the two veins that are found after the ears are beneficial for old coughs, and headache, and earache, and bad sores in the head.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of bloodletting is as I am telling you.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is to cut the head of the patient: and its scalp should be rubbed with a good friction using a rough cloth at the site of the two veins.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then let the patient hang his neck with galls (a type of leather) until the two veins become visible.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And their locations are behind the ears at two depressed spots on the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	So find them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, there mark it with hot wax.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take the bloodletting tool, which is called the Incidens.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	And then insert it under the vein into the skin until the bloodletting tool reaches the opening (the orifice).
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then raise your hand with the vein and skin up towards the top, and cut the vein along with the skin in the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And let the length of the incision be equal to that of two joined fingers, or roughly so, and allow as much blood to escape as you can.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then bind it with powders, and let it go free until it heals.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And now precedes at the beginning of the book the cutting of them and their cauterization.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	¶ On bloodletting with two arteries simultaneously.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	However, two arteries which are useful for bloodletting in the times of phlebotomy are: and the hot one and the obturator, and a running exudate from over-abundant discharges to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of bloodletting for them is as I am about to tell you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	The invalid should have their neck bound tightly until two veins become evident through apparent manifestation; and there should be a pulse beneath your finger of them.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then the signs will appear with the cautery.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then raise the skin above the vein towards the top with your index finger, and insert the bloodletting tool below and downwards, then lift the vein upwards.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And cut it as you did with other two veins: and make the blood flow out according to the need of your requirement.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then release the constriction of the invalid and place your finger on top of the vein for one hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then place over it the skin and powders, and bind it tightly from above with a firm bandage; then let it go free until it heals.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	And now a reminder about them and their incision, and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	On bloodletting for the forehead after Cephalic bloodletting.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	However, the advantage of bloodletting for the forehead is after Cephalic bloodletting, against old facial ailments: and against migraines, and redness: and festering sores.

Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	Restrict the sick person's neck with a bandage until a vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	Then take the tool that is called The Fosserium.
Cuius haec est forma.	And this is its form.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	Place the突出 point of The Fosserium which is at the head over the vein, and hit it with the tines or with another tool in a similar manner. And let the blood flow according to how much you wish.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	Then release the puncture of the sick person and tighten it until they heal.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes an opening is made with a wider bloodletting tool.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not necessary for the bloodletting tool to have a sharp end like the other bloodletting tools; rather, it should have a broader end.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And the bloodletting tool should follow the curve of your face since it is close to this area; and perhaps when the tool is thin, it might break at the mouth.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	On bloodletting for veins around both Lacrymal areas.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	However, the advantage of bloodletting for the two veins that are around both Lacrymal areas of the two eyes is against eye issues from scabies and redness: and facial ailing health within the eye, and ailments on the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	And what is the quality of bloodletting for them, that the sick man should tighten his neck when he is bled.

Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	And let the bloodletting be done according to the crossing at a slight lengthening with respect to the length of the blooddrawer, wide somewhat, for there is no flesh in that place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	For if the blooddrawer is thin at the extremity, perhaps it will break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	Then let there flow from the blood as much as you need for yourself.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	And place over them cloths, and tighten them overnight once, then release them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	Section on bloodletting of the Nasal method.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.

Then hold their nose with your left hand and take the thin, long blooddrawer. Attach it at the middle of its own snout, between that which distinguishes its nose according to its direction.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Because the vein is not perceptible by touch there and since blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And you should hold your hand with the blooddrawer somewhat wide open: and let there flow from the blood as much as you need for yourself.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then tie that overnight once.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	Itself, she/he will be restored quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	The instruction for bloodletting from Guidegian's surgical guide.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	Two thirds of Guidegian's instruction on bloodletting is useful for constriction of breathing, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic ailments, and scabies, and bad sores, and corrosive ones, that is, blistering diseases.

Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	Then do likewise for another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	Afterwards release the bandage and tie up both veins tightly in the middle: so that the sick person is not burned.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And let her go until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	For the wound is healed.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	The instruction for bloodletting by Algeberrich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	The improvement for Algeberich's bloodletting is: because it aids in alcohol in the mouth and gum decay: and bad sores: and cracks of the lips, and bad sores, even those that are in the nose, and around its circumference.

Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then turn their lips and look at two veins: one is from the right lip, and the other is from the left of them: and the demonstration of each is through the darkness of the beard.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And this is true: because around them are tiny, black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore, proceed with both cuts in the same direction.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if there is doubt about you, and you do not know which one it is: then proceed to the cut of the larger one, and that will be more obvious.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do it with the two veins in the upper lip: and a great deal of custom comes with that, and proceed with the two veins in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Section on Bloodletting: The vein under the tongue after cephalic bloodletting.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	Regarding the two veins which are under the tongue for bloodletting: it is that, cephalic bloodletting is useful for anticipatory measures in the throat, and nausea, and illnesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of bloodletting for these is, to have the sick person seated between your hands facing the sun: and raise their tongue, and look under his/her tongue from the side, one vein from each side: and the color of both declines towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore, bloodlet both veins: and be careful not to let your last hand come into contact with the bloodletting on them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For beneath them are arteries, and perhaps there might be a flow of blood from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Section on the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins that are bloodlettable in the elbow are those for which there is a custom of bloodletting in all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their bloodletting is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or by pricking with a myrtle bloodletting tool: or by oiling to hasten its descent: or by cutting with a surgical knife, and this is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is, suited for sectioning.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from these, there are broad forms and subtle ones according to the width of the veins and their tension. The Myrtle blood抽出 tool would have a broad form as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening up concave veins, full ones, those that proceed, those that are visible, large, and those containing thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this blood抽出 tool is of lesser width and has finer ends.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for blood抽出 of thin veins that contain thin yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	¶ On blood抽出 from the Basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilica vein, which is one of these three veins for blood抽出, proves to be useful.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the sicknesses which are below the throat and neck, because they follow the chest and belly: and it is suitable for the blood抽出 instrument with respect to the basilic vein, so that it avoids her, and be on guard about fear of her since under her is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore she misses, and adds to the point of the blood抽出 instrument, it will strike that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, it is necessary that the blood抽出 instrument be not used with a prick instrument: rather, use it with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the Basilica does not appear with its obvious manifestation, then it is necessary to remove that one and exchange to another vein, or look for a part of it: or use the blood抽出 instrument instead of it as the arm cord.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	Indeed it is evident, and dry it with a phlebotomy sponge, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you are performing phlebotomy on the same limb, then it is necessary to precede the arm's constriction until you can touch the site, so as to recognize where to apply pressure.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then, mark the site with the hot wax (encaustic method), afterwards apply to the arm and cut the vein with an inwardly concave incision using the phlebotomy tool Alnesil, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware not to hit through the space towards the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that, with the constriction of the ligature, there is an expansion at the spot marked with wax, then that swelling is due to the artery. Therefore, it should be treated accordingly.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see that blood rises at the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and it is thin, red; then you will know because it comes from arterial blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	So then act promptly, and place your finger on the area for a while, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	So if blood is being removed (for much is removed), then constrict the arm, and release it. And be cautious of the patient's movement: let him lie on his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move him for a few days until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If however no blood is being removed and it overcomes you: and if there is no medicine available to you at the moment, then cut into the artery if you see it.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	Because its extremities contract and blood is being removed.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of the bark of the elm tree and grind it. Take half and apply it over the place where the vein should be tied, along with the ligature until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is removed, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then take care of it with him to whom remembrance of its place from the location of powder flow out is good. And the removal of blood from him is not difficult in many positions due to the scarcity of wounds and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	¶ On bloodletting with the Fossa Venæ.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	Bloodletting from the Fossa Venæ is helpful as it draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower parts of the body. This is because it consists of a branch of the Basilic vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is suitable for the bloodletter that there should be a scar from his bloodletting, because under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore they add to the puncture of bloodletting and finds a nerve, an accident happens there that causes him to be dazed, and his recovery becomes difficult, and perhaps he will not be completely healed.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If however it is hidden in some people, and is fine and not visible: then you should use your bloodletting method where you can find the nerve, cut with Alnesil, and avoid hitting the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	And if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein longitudinally.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	¶ On the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Bloodletting from the Cephalic Vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and aids in eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary to perform bloodletting properly in this vein if you wish, using a greasy bloodletting tool or a myrtle-based bloodletting tool: because it is the most favorable of all veins as there is neither artery nor nerve below it.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is necessary for you when performing venous bloodletting to instruct the bloodletter to place only the head of the lizard (i.e., the needle), and search for a softer spot: and it does not harm him if he cannot be found with percussion first, so that he might pass over it several times with the bloodletting tool.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, it may happen in some individuals that the lancet should not be applied with percussion first when venous bloodletting is performed, but this fact of leaving a puncture does not harm him in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	¶ On the utility of Venous Bloodletting and precautions to be taken in performing it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of venous bloodletting and the events resulting from it require you to think about their correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, you must understand for what reason it is necessary that when bloodletting is not performed without consideration for health preservation and perseverance, or precautions against the onset of sickness.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And for bloodletting to be done using three veins in the arm, namely the cephalic vein, the dark (or basilic) vein, and the femoral vein.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And bloodletting should be done at the beginning of Vespers on an empty stomach, truly and in summer: and in autumn and winter after convalescence, when signs of fullness are evident.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And bloodletting should be done on the first or third day, after more than three hours have passed from the beginning of the day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	As for bloodletting performed during sicknesses, it does not have a specific time set. Rather, when the occasion and necessity call for this, it can be done at night or day, at any hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary to perform bloodletting on children until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Neither is a pregnant woman subjected to bloodletting, unless from the fourth month up until the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Old men are not subjected to bloodletting, who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Therefore, when someone wishes to undergo bloodletting for any reason: it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines before bloodletting using a mild enema, if there is a lot of retained feces in them: so as not to attract the veins during bloodletting from the intestines putrid excesses harmful to vital limbs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Neither is bloodletting performed on the patient who has nausea from satiety: nor the drunken one, nor the one recovering from drunkenness, until that thing is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Neither is a sick person with hydrocele.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And it should be avoided for bloodletting immediately after a bout of colic, vomiting, abdominal discharge, increase in sexual activity, labor, exercise, vigil, fasting, and anything that dissipates virtue from bodily or animal matter.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of fluids beforehand, if blood is thick with food and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible to do that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then take a bath if nothing forbids it: or engage in some exercise to thicken the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And perform bloodletting on his chest on the third day, as we said: and try to have him evacuate from his chest that day with all animal illnesses: such as constriction, anger, and fear. And from all bodily events, like labor, punishment, excessive sexual activity, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let his place be filled with things before which the custom of men runs like a habit from their fragrance, and aroma, and flavor, and similar things by quantity to the possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the bloodletter sits above the bleeding trough, which should be higher than the bleeding trough for bloodletting: afterwards he extends his arm and rubs it with his own hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he ties the ligament with a twist, and wraps it around him twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, for when an uneven constriction is present, or due to excess in the constriction, then it obstructs the blood flow. Or if there's a laxness, then too it obstructs the blood flow.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the blooddrawer rubs his own hands simultaneously on the site of constriction until the veins are filled and their presence becomes apparent to touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then, the blooddrawer cleanses the blooddrawer with a little oil, appropriately and traditionally.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then, place his index finger of the left hand on the vein at the desired location for bloodletting, only slightly. So that it does not make the vein disappear and a strike is set.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For at bloodletting, what you find in the veins is like a fleeing string: and from them there's one that's filled with wind. And when you place your blooddrawer on it, it contracts under the blooddrawer, and thus the blooddrawer misses the strike and does not open the vein: and if he opens it, then it becomes tight due to this reason; hence for this purpose, the blooddrawer should be firmly in place and attentive to all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then, let the blooddrawer release.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein opens from one place, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then try another place under that spot with a little pressure or above it with direction. If the spot does not respond.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If he is weakened by the operation or if it extends for too long, then release him on that day, or after two days: and do not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps it might attract a hot abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should he enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then perform bloodletting again if he enjoys it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the incision is small or if the blood flows thinly: and you fear that too much will not come out from the blood than desired; then perform repeated bloodletting in the hole itself according to its direction, and add a little less in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do that with caution before the wound starts to heal, as the wound heals in many people after a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you see that it is already forming pus, then do not repeat it over it at all, for nothing excuses anything in front of you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place some of the oil from the fat over it: because it expedites the course of the blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And this is better in this place than just oil and other kinds of oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the fat of oil in all your bloodlettings, where bloodletting prevents the flow of blood using veins: and they do this with Tyrian crocus, and saffron, when it is placed on one of them over the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood becomes thinner and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If an abscess occurs at the site of bloodletting that is large, which happens quite often, especially to someone who has not been bled except by that method, or if a small incision of a vein is made, then proceed and place over the site a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated moderately: and tie it for an hour; because it will dissolve.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the removal of blood from the vein itself, with its complement, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If after several days there remains in the place some blackness or greenishness, it is harmless: and if you desire to do so, apply a little of an aloe or myrrh solvent. Or use something from the mint juice, that is, calamus or similar.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	Indeed, it often happens with bloodletting and emaciation near the basilic vein.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore place your hand over it, then if you find that area to be soft upon pressing your hand on it, then that prominence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, be careful to apply something from what we said on it.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood flows from that artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster with it where there is coagulation, so that the place hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you extract from every person according to the amount of their strength in blood.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what becomes apparent from the fading color over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it pass until it becomes red: and similarly if you see that it is thick: then let it go on passing until it becomes fine: and similarly if it is sharp, let its sharpness be removed until it passes.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for the person who is full, strong, and needs to be bled by one method that the bloodletting should increase within the vein, and become a lateral bloodletter: and in the one who is weak, it should be opposite of this.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it must be that he removes it in veins, and that there is a tight opening: and better when applied in bloodletting of veins, that there is a cross section, not piercing.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is beneficial against the flow of blood and the injury to nerves: and it is more commendable and more beneficial than bloodletting across the width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And for those who are accustomed to undergo bloodletting with syncopation, it should be that the meals before bloodletting consist of a moderate amount of bread soaked in pomegranate water: or if the bread is toasted, that's fine as well. And you should take from his blood three times, or four times.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if it is a cold disposition, then before bloodletting, he should take bread soaked in honey syrup, or in flavored honey syrup with herbs, or in flavored syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	And if it happens that he experiences syncopation during bloodletting, and there is a reason for the flow of his blood to be abundant, then it should be that he drinks meat water and a subtle flavored syrup. He should use the aroma with algae and linseed oil on his chest with them. And he should make use of what we said in division regarding evacuation from syncopation in chapter "Excretion".
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	And if someone wants to bleed their arm and release their blood a second time: it should be for the person whose bloodletting is due to excessive evacuation, and their strength is weak, that they should gradually relieve the blood over quantities of strength on continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	And if someone wants to bleed their arm and release more blood a second time, and their body is strong, then do that seven or nine hours after his first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Those who wish to draw blood from their body towards the opposite part of which they are inclined: it should happen to him on the second day or on the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is much blood that has already been heated and sharpened, causing a fever to occur: it should happen that blood leaves this body through one vessel, and a large amount of blood is removed from it. The opening should be expanded until symptoms occur due to syncope. After you have maintained all the conditions for phlebotomy, and when placing your hand on his pulse along the course of the blood, ensure death does not occur in place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Indeed, it often happens this: when the phlebotomist does not know and falls into negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it should not be when you wish to release the arm and remove blood after, while the vein's opening is already closed, making the removal of blood difficult. If it happens that the patient is in dizziness and they are trying to press upon it quickly, then it may cause a torn extension.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	That is a serious mistake; indeed, release it until the second bloodletting has occurred.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of a bloodletting tool that which has coagulated from the blood in the vein's opening, and place something dissolved in water over it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place something from the ashes of rue or salazone over it, and apply it with gentle compression until blood flows.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed the pustule is on the vein, then let it go and do not keep it until the pustule calms.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If necessity prompts for a second bloodletting and there is no excuse, then either apply the bloodletting tool over that place or on another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	However, if they cannot find the veins of the arm as a substitute for Fuscae and Basilica when they are not present and hidden, because it is composed from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the sick person inserts his hand into warm water until it flushes red and a vein becomes distinctly visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then, when a medium constriction is applied with the band over it.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then perform the phlebotomy along the direction of the flow gradually, not longitudinally or laterally. And make the opening wide, and your phlebotomy should be large enough to fit a phlebotomy over the incision on the hand in the vicinity.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the escape of blood is hindered, then immerse your hand in warm water, and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve what you need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however, it is during the summer days, then you will discontinue immersing your hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And quite a lot of the blood's flow is conducted through warm water during the winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And this vein's phlebotomy is beneficial to all veins because it is not under that pulsating vein nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The phlebotomy of Saluatella's right hand is effective against stomach pains.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that you bind the hand with a band or your own hand after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein fills and becomes evident to the touch.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then perform the phlebotomy by flowing across (the area).
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you hit it entirely, that will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And conserve, do not let your last hand touch the bloodletting instrument.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under it (the surface) are the nerves of the fingers exposed through the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then move your hand to the warm water, and let the blood flow in that.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not move her (the patient) into warm water, the blood will clot in the puncture of the vein, and prevent it from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	And when you have extracted the necessary amount from the blood, then place oil and salt over the vein: so that it does not harden quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly you should do with every tightened branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	However, the advantage of bloodletting from his left hand is this: because it leads to the spleen disorders; and similarly do in his bloodletting as you did in the second equal.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The advantage of saphenous bloodletting is for ailments that occur in the lower part of the body, such as womb disorders, retention of menses, and kidney illnesses, as well as old sores on thighs and legs, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of his bloodletting is for the patient to immerse his foot in warm water and perform friction until the veins overflow; and tie above the cut on the foot with strips.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the location of the veins is at the heel, facing the big toe: and they branch out from there into many branches on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, perform bloodletting at the wider branch of it or near the heel in its collection point: for it is better and more beneficial.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If phlebotomy is performed on her at the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are under it above the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And suppose you perform your phlebotomy in such a way that you hit the arterial system from an oblique direction, as if you were to strike it: let the phlebotomy be done by Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If the flow of blood is obstructed, then immerse his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into that until it is drained.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the surgeon makes a mistake during his first operation, then he should proceed with another phlebotomy towards the upper parts, for there is safety in that area, and you do not fear harm when you avoid the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the other opposite ankle.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the sciatic veins, as we said, is at the heel on the outer side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	The beneficial aspect of his bloodletting is to alleviate pain in the heel when this is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	The quality of his bloodletting is such that the sick should enter into bathing water and relax. And bind his leg from the side of the heel up to four fingers above the heel with a thin, long bandage; for it does not appear otherwise.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it becomes apparent, then a bloodletting is made according to whatever skill you have, or by an oblique direction: and it's better, whether by making an incision or cutting through.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	Its location is safer, and it is greatly hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and it does not appear clearly to the senses: then perform bloodletting on some of its branches, and that one which appears in the heel and towards the ear is it. And beware of the nerves, and let a quantity of blood flow from your strength.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then release the constriction, and place the spot for phlebotomy with fat, and tighten the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	Indeed, it is quickly healed.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	¶ On Wind Movement, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Winds are produced from grains, and from air, and from windpipe.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And Wind Movement occurs according to two methods.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	One method is with incision and bloodletting: the other is wind movement without incision.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this Wind Movement which occurs without incision happens in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is when using fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without the use of fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And wind therapies that are administered with incisions and bloodletting apply to fourteen body areas.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	And there are fourteen body areas where wind therapies administered with incisions and bloodletting can be applied. One of these is the Wind Movement Alnocrati, which is at the very end of the head: another is Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck. There are two Wind Movements Alhagdahim, corresponding to both sides of the neck simultaneously: there's also the Wind Movement on the brain, below the jawbone under the lower part of the mouth; this is another one called Wind Movement of the shoulders. A Wind Movement called Alachosos is found at the end of the tail: There are two Wind Movements known as focilium which are in the middle of both upper arms: there are also two Wind Movements on each leg, and finally, there are two Wind Movements associated with the kidneys.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed, Wind Movement does not draw blood from tiny punctures scattered on your body. Because of this, its power doesn't diminish like it would after a bloodletting procedure.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	It is not necessary for the inhalation of air, with or without fire, to be given when sickness occurs due to fullness, until the entire body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity prompts us to perform an inhalation due to sickness or because of a habit, we should administer it at any time during the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of that period, and at whatever time it happens.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because there are people who, when the blood increases within them until it needs to be removed through inhalation, find their head heavy and dizzy.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them there are those who find fullness and redness on their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them there are those who find itching on their face and forehead, darkness, and confusion in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them there are those who feel the spot of where their inhalation occurs.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them is the person whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them there are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth: or they may be troubled by their tongue and expel blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them is the person whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them is the person who sees blood and redness, as well as dead people and wounds, and things similar to these, during their sleep.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	So when we see anything from these (indications), and especially during the middle third of the month: we then command that inhalation take place after passing two hours or three.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The improvement of the inhalation at the back of the neck is: because it brings heaviness to the head and what flows reaches the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	It is necessary that this remain after evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And indeed, the Ventosa serves in place of the Cephalic Bloodletting.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not allowed for those with cold constitutions or those who have phlegm to use this.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings about great harm to her.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of this, it is not allowed for them to use such things as old people, and those whose head has cold ailments.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	And whoever regularly performs it, forgetfulness is generated towards it.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of this, it is necessary that you command the user of the Ventosa to use it sparingly with the Ventosa, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosa or Alkehel serves as a substitute for the bloodletting procedures such as Fusca and Basilica. Due to this, it causes coughing, constriction of breathing, inhalation from the tool's edges, coughing, and feeling fullness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the Alkehel be pushed gently with the Ventosa, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosa Alhagdahim causes pain occurrences in the head, eye diseases, migraines, and perforations, as well as toothache: it serves as a substitute for the bloodletting procedure of the Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you command the user of the Ventosa, not to press his hand with the scarification: so as not to hit an artery and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Ventosa under the chin causes alcohol to gather in the mouth and gum decay, as well as similar ailments that occur in the mouth: and it serves as a substitute for the bloodletting procedure called alieherich, which is located on both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The ventilation of spatulas is similar to that of an alchafacham, which is made by folding and heating.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The ventilation of the inner parts of two stoves compares favorably to the benefit of bloodletting with three phlebotomies: Basilicae, Fuscae, and Cephalica. For it draws blood from all those tiny veins that are in the flesh. And these small veins draw from other, larger veins for them until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you carefully control the ventilation tool, so that it does not proceed excessively during incisions: because there is a skinless area, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The suction apparatus that is ventilated over wax candles compares to hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you carefully control the Ventosatori tool, so that the suction apparatus is large and made of air: because a strong suction is needed at the site, and perhaps delicate Ventosai might be broken, and deep incisions would be made.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The suction devices for the legs reduce a clear diminution: because they draw blood from the entire body and bring old pains to the kidneys, uterus, and bladder. They cause menstruation and induce vomiting and diarrhea, and soften menopause. And they stand in place of phlebotomy with two saphenous veins, and avorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they greatly weaken the body and cause syncope to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	The improvement of Ventosai for the avorcobeni is similar to the improvement of Ventosai for the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of positioning the Ventosai is to place the suction tool in the first vacuole and let a tempered suction flow; do not prolong the position of the Ventosai, but put them quickly and remove them quickly so that fluids arrive at the site equally: do not stop the process until you see the spot turn red and swell, and blood reddening becomes apparent: then proceed to incision and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the arrangement of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those who are of tender flesh, with few hairs, it is necessary that you scarificate yourself once, no more: so as not to develop a sore.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the Windistributor to expand the scarification and deepen it slightly. And regulate the suction with ease, velocity, and gentle movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is a thickening in the blood, then it is necessary that you scarificate yourself twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In urine, the first way opens for the thinning of blood and its liquidity. And in the second, for a detailed exploration and extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is exceedingly viscous though, then a third operation of scarification should be done: in order to achieve the final result.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And for the last stage, when we wish to extract blood gradually or in small amounts, one operation of scarification is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we want multiple extractions of blood, we perform numerous scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it must be scarified by a deep incision. And the end of an incision equals the depth of skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which needs to be administered from oils regarding the positioning of Windistributors, and what should the windistributor avoid.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In this case, for the skin which is thick, tough, dark, and has its pores constricted, it must be that oily areas are applied to the Windistributors. If this occurs during summer time, such as with almond oil, or lavender oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from pumpkin seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in wintertime, then use narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or saffron oil; and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If it is necessary for excess fat to be reduced in a cold condition, then use bitter oil, or oil of balsam tree, or white oil, or juniper oil; and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If it is necessary for the winds to be reduced in those with many small pores and tender skin, then oil should be avoided, and after wind massage they should wash the parts of Venterum (i.e., abdominal region) using water that has been flavored with rose petals, or cold water, or water warmed by sunlight, or water mixed with cucumber juice, or water mixed with portulaca leaves: and similar treatments.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	That is, for someone whose blood has excess moisture, one should wash the winds with vinegar, or water flavored with myrtle leaves, and sumac: and similar treatments.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	For those who have excesses of fat, wash their winds with old wine, or water flavored with Samsam (dates), or a decoction of juniper berries, or chamomile tea: and similar treatments.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it should be that wind massage occurs in a bath, or at the margin of a bath, or else it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And one should not allow anyone to sleep after wind massage.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is the regulation that should be followed before wind massage or bloodletting?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	AND after that, you should consider first: if it is someone who has been treated for winds or bloodletting and they have a choleric constitution, with the sharpness and inflammation over their blood; then it should be that they receive cooling remedies like chilled pomegranate seeds. And also take endive mixed with vinegar and lettuce, and sage tea and anise: and similar treatments.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And place his food with chickens, and mix its eggs with olive oil, and cooked foods with herbs: and similar to these.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And for those who have a cold constitution, they should consume syrup from honey or from almonds, or from the extract made with seeds: and they should drink a fragrant medium wine, which is between old and new ones: and it's advised that they use very little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And place his diet with chickens, and fish: and birds like sparrows: and young pigeons.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it should be that the amount of drink during ventosa and phlebotomy is more than the food: and it should be consumed in drinks where some people take taurine herbs or a medicine made from musk, i.e., muscatel, or aloe before ventosa: and before phlebotomy, or after: so as to strengthen the main limbs, and refine the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it should not be that they consume it in heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	¶ On Ventosas without incision.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Ventosas without incision are those that are placed over the elbow, spleen, ankle, and stomach, belly button, kidney locations, and the buttocks. As these limbs do not tolerate incisions on themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And there is no need to inquire about these through them, except for suction from the blood vessel member: just as we place a Ventosa over the nipples during a condition of nasal bleeding.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to relieve the cold ventosa hidden within the limb: just as we place a ventosa on the stomach and the belly button.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	Indeed, it thins out the member, and warms it up, and removes pain for this reason, because it resolves that wind.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed on the kidneys when there is drunkenness or a stone occurring in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	Indeed, perhaps by virtue of its attractive force, it may open up the drunkenness or remove the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	Similarly, it is done when it is placed over the ileum and spleen for soothing that wind occurring within them in both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these winds are administered with water only during cutting.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are given with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are given full with warm water in dyspepsia and pleurisy: that is, to fill the Ventricle, and let it be large, hot water alone, or water into which herbs suitable have been cooked.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of the Ventricle administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let its size be two fingers open as we have formed it, and its depth be half the length of the palm. It should be positioned on the side about halfway up where there are small holes depending on the quantity entering the needle itself. It can be made from metal or from cork, or from soft, equal, polished material so that it does not injure the organ at its position over it. There should be a stick crossing in the middle of it made from metal or wood when a candle with fire is placed there.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this venticle is large enough, larger than what we have described, and the other somewhat smaller according to the dyspepsia and age of the person who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	Indeed, ventricles for children and emaciated people are different from those for adults and robust bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this hot iron upon the member, is to ignite a small linen wick fire or a tiny candle made from tallow, and place it over the central intersection of the rod that is in the middle of the iron. It should have the flame of the fire near the lower part of the iron so that the body of the patient is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place it upon the member: and let the finger be over the hole I mentioned until when we hold the iron. When needed, remove the finger and allow vapor to escape through that hole, and the iron will immediately clear.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Next, ignite according to its manner, and repeat this if needed.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the case of the ventosa (cupping method) that is administered in pleurisy with water, there is no crossing rod or hole: and it is not administered unless the water fills up, and is only placed over the member.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the larger the ventosa (cupping method), the more water it can contain, the better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	¶ Concerning the suspension of Blood Sugar levels.
Caput XCIX.	Number 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood sugars (cupping treatments) are not administered in many areas, except where there is no possibility of placing the iron cups due to their shape, as with the lip, gum tissue, and similar areas.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on an exposed part of the body from flesh, such as a finger, nose, and similar areas.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality for using them is: to purify from sweet waters with the herbs found on the cupping glasses, removing the bad smells.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be immersed in sweet water each day and night until the smell disappears completely, ensuring nothing remains in their stomach.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should be cleansed first with bloodletting and with evacuations.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then cleanse the sick member until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Next, place something on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	And when they develop, and fall off, and if it is possible to suck the area with suction, then this is much the last stage in healing. And if not, then cleanse the area with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then wash with plenty of water, and rub, and press out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of the blood prolongs after the case of Blood sugar and is this dripping: then immerse a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top until the dripping stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood increases, then spread over it a powder of wheat flour or gall and similar substances from styptic plants, until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place on the area slices of bark taken from trees: and remove them until the seeds stick to the site, for then the bleeding is stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it must be that if Blood sugar (a medical treatment) is necessary, when possible, they should be changed.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If Blood sugar (a medical treatment) is prohibited due to retention, then cleanse the site with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or fix a point in places until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place them, for they stick immediately when they sense something from the blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you wish for them to fall, powder something from ground aloes, or salt, or ashes over them, and they will immediately fall.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	¶ The End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A universal discourse on restoration, and dislocation, and treatment of twisting injuries, and similar conditions.
Caput I.	Head I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is frequently necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is about restoring fractures and accidents resulting from dislocations in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, my sons, that many are the proud physicians and common folk who speak of this chapter, those who have never seen or read an excerpt from the old book.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this reason, it happens that this manner of knowledge from the sciences is absent in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never been fortunate enough to find anything good in it, and I do not gain from it what I would gain otherwise, only due to the length of reading old books and studying them until I could extract knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then by means of my experimental efforts and study over time.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have detailed to you all of what my knowledge contains from this chapter: and regarding what escapes the experience of myself, after I have abbreviated it for you, freed it from the occupation of elongation, abbreviated it at its end in abbreviation, and shown it at its end in declination. And I have formed many forms within it, derived from the forms of instruments that are used in this manner, when there is addition to declination, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	In summary and as a collection, we should consider the fractures of bones from which it is necessary for us to present beforehand before beginning our recollection of the fractured members, and various types thereof if each one individually.
Caput II.	Head II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we state in the introduction of this chapter the main points to be discussed and chapters towards understanding which drive one's intellect first: namely, for you, those who are prepared, to know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when someone suffers from a fracture, or dislocation, or twist, or any other accident, then you should first proceed to perform bloodletting on him and relieve himself, or both at the same time: if there is no prohibition by something else such as weakness of strength; or it concerns him who experiences something similar to these issues being young or old in a state of decline; or it is the time for intense heat or intense cold to greatly prevail.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then be content with his food, cold herbs and bird meats, and avoid alcohol, heavy meats, and filling up from foods or any food that fills the blood vessels.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Once you are relieved from the heat of fever and do not feel an outpouring of pus to the member: then the sick person should return to his first routine diet according to what his habit is.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When then the broken mouth begins to heal, the sick person should consume food that provides abundant nourishment, in large quantities and in heavy foods with viscosity. Such as foods made from cooked wheat mixed with water, rice, heads, feet, udders of sheep, eggs, and fresh fish. And thick wine, and similar items.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this kind of diet, the healing of the fracture occurs more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And you will know that broken bones, when they are found in men who are at the beginning of old age and declining, do not remain continuous and consolidate according to their natural tendency always, due to drying out of their limbs. And the consolidating and continuing aspects which are from them towards the end of laxity occur like the bones of children or young ones.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature connects over the broken mouth from every part something similar to a paste, in which is thickness, to which it adheres and tightens itself until it cements together by itself, and binds together until it reaches the end of strength and firmness, just as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from performing its operations: for this reason, it is necessary to put food for the sick in things that have weightiness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you will know that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of members: for example, a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the skull bone: and a fracture of the rib bone is different from a fracture of the back bone: similarly, all other limbs are diverse among themselves: and I have come with the recall of all species of fractures explained in his chapter separately from each other.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of bone fractures are also varied within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because there is a curved fracture, besides which asterisks occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and there are fractures known as asterisms, that is, stars, and additions proceeding, just as they are in a reed when it is fitted with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: there is a fracture with a wound and breakage at the head, and there is a fracture of a small crack.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And for every species there is an art or a proper tool for its restoration, according to the recall of which it will be distinguished in its respective places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from which the fracture of bone is known, is its twist and its height; and its appearance to sense, and sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When then no twisting is observable in the place, nor sound when you touch the mouth with movement, nor does the unwell person find a great pain; then there is not there fracture, indeed it's possible that there is twisting or small crack: therefore it doesn't need to move it by hand and complete compression, indeed put over it from medicines whose recollection comes back, after that moment which fits the place: afterwards the constriction gets tightened subtly.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when the area is curved and divided into two parts, besides what happens in it, all its portion moves from its partner: then you must begin from your own time to the correction of it, equating it before it occurs a blister hot.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	And if a hot blister should occur to it, then let the thing rest for some days until the blister is quiet.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to whatever manner can be done by gentleness and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it, and its equalization, is easier than with bone where fractures occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten it, according to how its recollection will come back to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	And if there are fractures in the bone, then an extension of this broken member from two parts is necessary, whether it be a hand or a foot: or with your own hand if the member is small; or with two ropes, or with rope and hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be when you place the member over an equal location, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try to make those additions by all ingenuity and any manner possible in their places: and beware according to your strength, lest there be pain or damage upon the unwell from your operation; and try according to your strength, to apply one or two bones with their own partner, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour, that you try and touch him with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	And if you see anything different there, correct it, and adjust that by the measure of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of excessive stretching and strong compression, as many do with the duller patients.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	Indeed, many times it happens during their own operation that a blister becomes hot, or there is constriction in the body: as we have already seen from their operations on numerous occasions.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then attach after equalization, and suitable operation, and the constriction of that limb, and peace, and tranquility: and warn the patient about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him aware not to move himself during his watch hours and his dream at the turning of his body, its agitation, and during his state of weakness, and all his movements with the full strength that remains.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And let him be cautious so that the position of the limb does not follow pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	This is because when he feels pain or injury in the position of the limb, then it is necessary that you rearrange him to another position from that with which he did not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with him, so that his position is that one equal and straight: lest when he recovers, any distortion should happen in the limb.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the constriction of a fractured limb is as I describe it.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that limbs broken differ in their weakness, and their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	So, those which are small among them, like the arm, finger, and thong, then it should be that there is a soft, delicate dressing.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those among them that are larger, such as the thigh and leg, must have a broad, tough inner lining.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad ligament supports the large member and binds it from every side with an equal constriction, so that it does not penetrate itself by any means.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after your evacuation, start by applying an appropriate ointment to that, on the soft plaster over the site of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to roll the ligament over the site of the fracture three times, or four, according to what is suitable for the member: and press your hand with moderation against the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with it to the upper part from the site of the fracture, and press less than you did when you tightened the fractured area.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then extend yourself gradually with the rolling at the site of the fracture, and gradually soften the constriction until you feel a large amount coming from the healthy area.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another poultice and roll it again over the fractured area.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then go with the rolling to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be on the constriction of the rolling and its softening, as we said about the first rolling above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place the intervals with soft plaster or cloth, according to how it tightens the fracture if there is such tightness in it; but if not, do not put anything on her.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then roll another poultice over that one.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then evacuate the area surrounding these rolls centrally immediately, if there is no swelling or blister at the site, and do not apply a warm compress.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is a swelling or pus formation within it, then place over that which is seated the pus and remove the inflammation; and let her rest for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then, bind over it at that time star needles.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the star needles be made from the middle parts of a reed, shaved and skillfully formed; or let them be made from wood which produces sieves, those that come from pine, or from geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi: and let the width of all the star needles have this form and this same shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it must be that the star needle which is placed over it should be somewhat thicker and wider than the other star needles: and the length of the star needle should be according to what fits the size and strength of the limb.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind over the star needles with another thread in accordance with the first binding method.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind over with threads crosswise, according to what we said about binding: and it is that your binding should be thicker at the break site than when binding. And the more extended from the break, the lesser the binding.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it must be that the threads have medium thickness and fineness, and they should be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, like I've seen in the procedure of those who place thread made from twisted linen strings, there is a great mistake: because the binding falls outside its quality with them.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And very thin threads do not agree either: for you cannot follow through the binding with them what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it should not be that there is less than a finger's width between one star needle and the other.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the sick person is injured through the ends of his fingers after tightening in healthy places: then put under them something soft from a dressing or treated wool until nothing gets hurt from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When however there is fracture with ulna, and a disruption occurs in the skin, I heal it remembering its particularity in chapter two.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken limb needs to be bound with pins from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	This is because when a limb is large, it should not be put under itself pins until after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the risk of dislocation in hot baths.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of bandages that were used in ancient times to restore fractures and dislocations, which are applied over them.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common method of bandaging abbreviated for restoration, suitable for various constitutions, particularly women and children: because it is on what heat does not dominate nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is that you take from the mill dust powder and the starch which hangs on the walls of the mill during milling motion: and make it as such, excepting sieving it with flour. And apply its mixture not thick nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The other method of bandaging, for the restoration of fractures, dislocations, and twists.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Prescription for almond oil, laurel oil, acacia oil, wormwood and myrrh extract: take all the oils mentioned, three drams of myrrh, and five drams each of aloes and alethil. Grind everything finely together and mix it with alethil water or flour if the constitution is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this poultice.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	Indeed, it is a good compound, healing broken bones quickly and benefiting many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	A method for making a poultice, which also aids in the healing of fractures and sprains.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Recipe for a poultice, which includes measure parts of myrrh and gum, as well as six parts of acacia and twenty parts of Armenian balsam. All ingredients are finely ground together in abundance and sifted, then made into a paste with water or milk: and they are administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method for using the poultice in cases of dislocations and bones separated from their places: and it soothes the pain that befalls them, as well as the tearing apart of bones, and the breakage.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Wool is taken, cleaned, and submerged in an acetous solution, and then cooked with oil: and it is placed over the area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this poultice, it does not have the virtue of restoration, but it is good for soothing heat-induced symptoms: and it drives away pains specifically.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	A method for using the poultice that restores a fractured bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of the deaf fig, and the leaves of the wild elder: and grind all together, then make a poultice from each.

Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe for the root of chamomile, and wildflower, and flowers of mullein, and herb flour, all in one part: grind all together, then make them into a paste with wine if there is no heated member.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is heated, then mix that with water infused with coriander, or just use water, and use it accordingly.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	The method of plastering for a stronger healing process during repair of a member, as opposed to the first one, when there happens to be hard pus at the restoration point.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe for the root of the high plant, seeds of flax, of balsam, of honey rush, of cumin, and of violet flowers, as well as of chamomile. All ingredients are mixed together in equal parts, they are ground and then prepared with willow water or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	The entire thing according to the heat of the member, and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that something should be placed on the broken member during its restoration, other than a catgut made from catgut and oil: nothing else, and he said it should be of medium size between thickness and fineness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	However, Galen prescribes that during the restoration of a broken member, they should be placed on it substances with heat abatement, such as myrrh, frankincense, and similar ones among those we have described.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of plastering that strengthens against injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe for the mixture of mugwort, chickpeas, human hair from the incisors or bird feathers, and the root of the high plant; all parts are equal. They should be ground together and sifted, then prepared to make a plaster膏from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The amount required should be one that keeps the bandage in place. Then dissolve it at the time when you can determine whether there is no weak pain, no itching, and the broken mouth does not move from its place: then do not resolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If there occurs to it itching in that place, or an annoying pain, or swelling: then hasten and dissolve it at the hour, and remove the plaster from him: and take a soft cloth, or a sponge moistened, humid. And immerse it in warm water, and cleanse that place with it until the itching subsides and the pain is settled.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then cut off the member and allow it to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place a woolen cloth soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose-oiled, over it, and bind it at night for one day until you are free from warm sweating, and let the swelling of the member subside and remove its pain.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then bandage the wound with a thin wrap and use a small poultice. Do not tighten the bandage too much at first, and keep it loose enough until you are healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see pus, redness, pain, swelling, and all other symptoms have disappeared entirely, and you no longer need any dressing or bandaging, then continue as you did at first with an even application.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing of what we said happens to the member, then do not cut it loose, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when twenty days have passed since it is cut off, according to what you perceive from the condition of the member after its removal, as we said, until when the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh over that place begins: then add more bandaging than your first throughout in the bandage. Also add an increase in the consumption of nourishing food, according to how it has progressed before being reminded.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see that the site of fracture has already dried up and weakened more than necessary, then you will know that the food cannot reach there.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore, immerse it with warm water everywhere that you had immersed it, and let this happen in all three days, and relieve the bandage a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation, nutrition flows to the member and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	That which the foolish restorers do, using an aid for a broken limb when it does not heal as prescribed and then heals according to its curvature, is an error from their operation, and great fear: and if it was straight, they would say that this was what the old ones wrote in their books and would operate with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see any trace of theirs there at all, and it is better that this does not happen.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	¶ On the process of occurrence on the head.
Caput III.	Head III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of fracture are various and its figures many: and the causes thereof are distinguished.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For a fracture that occurs due to impact with an instrument: and the impact removes the entire mouth up to where it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, like when an ax cuts into wood. Therefore, this type of fracture is named the Axial Fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the blade of a tool hits some part of the bone and the face of it, and does not penetrate to its very end through cutting: and this type of fracture is named the Fracture of Calaan, that is, Absolute Exposure.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is either the wound between two fractures, or large, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is the fracture that results from rubbing or wearing away, and its cause is impact with a stone, or falling upon a stone, or similar occurrences.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this kind of fracture is penetrating as well, which already approaches the membrane that lies beneath the bone; or it is within the surface of the bone. And there is also a wound between these two fractures, whether small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is the fracture that occurs within the bone as thin as a hair: and it's a small crack, and for this reason, this type of fracture is named the Capillary Fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And there is a fracture which occurs by chance or by the impact of a stone and similar actions that cause an intrusion of bone layer into the interior, and it forms a concavity: like happens with iron when they are struck, and part of them gets into the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And much does happen to bone caps, such as those found on children's heads.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And these are formed with all these species of sutural fractures, and I refer to that entire matter again in its proper place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these types of fractures through their identification upon them, and examination with tests, and the removal of corrupted flesh that is above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species of Capillary is recognized through this: it is found over the bone, removed, and treated with wax: for indeed, the black fracture appears.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's condition. Then, if you observe signs from these conditions that clearly indicate serious illness, such as vomiting, expansion, loss of understanding, loss of voice, convulsions, acute fever, ejection of eyes, and redness to them, along with similar observations from various incidents, there is no doubt they are not healing; and if you see non-threatening incidents, and hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	This means, if a wounded person comes to you when they are being wounded, and it is during the winter days: then you must strive for the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to all circumstances.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is during the summer days, then you must hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from pus becomes corrupted, and those incidents we described occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of a bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and is with details and suction: then it is necessary that you enter the broken part and rubbed, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And do this, as if you were cutting off the head of a wound: and remove that above the mouth according to whatever possible way for you: and according to the pattern of wounds, and what is slight above the weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	And if you happen upon blood flow in the detection of a bone, or a warm pus: then oppose it with what is necessary alongside.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And do this, as if you were filling the space with soaked bandages in wine and rose oil: and let the wound rest until the pus has settled, and be free from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin with the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	Certainly, there is one method, where you cut the mouth with the edge of an incisive tool: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then apply another Incisor after the wider space of the incisors, and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	And then apply yet another Incisor broader than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that there are several different numbers of Incisors with you: some will be wider than others, and some shorter than others. They should have their ends sharpened and should be made of metal or hardened steel: use them with ease when striking over an Incisor, so as not to strike its head and damage it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the mouth is strong and hard, then you must pierce around it before you apply the Incisors with what are called Terebras which do not penetrate deeply: they are not called this way just because they do not pass through the end of the bone to that which comes after it. Therefore, since the Terebra is a round end under its sharp head similar to the edge and thin circle prevents sinking and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take from these drills a large number, each of which corresponds to the thickness quantity of bone until every drill is available to you: whose tip's sharpness in length and shortness be according to the thickness quantity of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three types of drills, or trepan needles.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality for drilling through a fractured bone is as follows: place the drill over the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then swap the drill to another location and place it with an amount of thickness between all openings equal to that of the radius or roughly this.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut through with the Incisors that are between all openings from the bone: and make this smaller than you can over what is at the end of thickness, as we said, until you remove the bone, or with your hand, or with something else from some tools you prepared for this: like small tongs, and subtle drills.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And you must take every precaution so that the drill or any of the Incisors does not touch the siphon.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you thus circumvent the bone while drilling and separate it from the siphon, if there is continuity with it and you remove it, you must scrape away and level off the remaining extremity that stays in the bone with another tool similar to an Incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it must be thin and subtle more than other Incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	And if there is anything remaining from the bones and splinters, then take them with ease using what you have from your tools.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then attend to the wound after that, using garlic and ointments as we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another mode of operation is easier, very far from fear: this said Galen and greatly praised himself. And this is his discourse.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first, to begin by uncovering the portion of the bone at the place where the fracture is more severe and clearer. Continue until when you have identified that part, and placed under it the tip of this rounded canine tooth, which has this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the rounded portion does not hit anything soft. And its acute part cuts into both sides of it to a length, as you can see: so that the rounded part should be inserted into the canal, with its sharp face hitting the bone from inside.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike above the canine tooth from one side with a small hammer until you enter the entire bone easily, as it revolves: and you should be careful about the cloth, so that nothing happens there that you fear very much.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon were not a fool among men and more ignorant of it, nor asleep, then if there remained anything attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would strike it off from him with the tip of his rounded canine tooth, and set him free from it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	Indeed, it is freed without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate until the cloth, and what is taken away from the bone is its face, and remaining in it roughnesses and subtle strata: then it must be that you remove that roughness, and uproot those strata with fine rasping tools from which you have prepared a number of different quantities, so that it is possible for you to administer them in every place more suitable for them and straighter for themselves, according to what the operation leads you to and the broken bone, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer according to your ratio, which among the first roots of the operation, a larger shaving tool should be used.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use one that is finer afterwards.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not stop doing that until you reach the point where you will administer something finer and more subtle among all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	For each remaining small groove and fine hair, when it comes to breaking or fracture, you need to apply care, according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a matter that does not hide itself from all who study this art, and it stands over what we wrote and showed in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If however, a wisp of hair is detected and retained when you extract the root: then it is necessary to take a linen cloth, according to the amount of wounds, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of linen, possibly doubled or trebled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, then place it over the first linen: and make this as easily as possible over that, so as not to cool off the scab.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer above it a wide bandage: and do not tighten it, unless its width can hold the wound only: and release it with this care after one day or two days, until you are safe from hot discharge.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it and administer after that medicines with which there is excessive dryness, such as the roots of lily, and herb meal, and thurifer dust, and aristolochia, and similar things: and you should make a powder from these medicines to be applied like powders over the wound.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply medicine of everything which has a property that it cleans without biting.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And beware according to your virtue, so that the wound in your care becomes clear: let there be no pus in it, nor impurities.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not let any poison accumulate completely within it: because when a poison accumulates over the brain's dressing, it spoils it and putsrefies itself, and something serious happens afterwards to the sick person. And then it occurs in the opening of the head, when its mouth is cleaned by him, especially when there is neglect of its care, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	So then consider this: if you encounter situations as we have described to you for the sick person, know that it is likely harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur, except due to the medicine that is placed upon him, and it has a property of that medicine which causes that blackness: then you must take one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and linen with these.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it over the opening: afterwards care for it with the appropriate remedies until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	¶ For the restoration when the nose is broken.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is not broken unless two of its upper parts are broken simultaneously, or one of them; because there are two bones in it. Because below it is cartilaginous, it does not break and it only occurs due to rubbing, twisting, and other similar factors.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is broken, then you should insert four fingers into the nasal aperture and equalize that fracture with your index finger and the thumb of your other hand until the nose returns to its natural shape. And this should be done skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, that through your operation, no pain befalls the sick person.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach that finger [a term referring to a specific part or region], then it must be corrected by balancing the extremity of the radius where there is thinness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If however the fracture is in two parts, then make it similar to that [some specific treatment or process]: and proceed with the restoration of it on the first day after the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day in a peaceful state immerse it in warm water.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then introduce a linen thread into the extremity of the nose if the fracture is in one part: or introduce two threads if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be in the thread such amount of thickness that it fills up the nasal opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the old restorers said that the linen threads should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That, however, does not seem to me right; rather, it should be that the linen thread is soaked in a paste made from saliva and ground meal.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the linen thread until the mouth becomes firm, and the cartilage hardens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is introduced into the nose instead of the linen thread after it has been covered with a soft cloth. And what happens is that the injured person holds the fracture of the nose more firmly and is not prevented from breathing due to this treatment.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this procedure is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that: and if you wish, do the linen thread.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If it happens that you are operating on the nose again with a warm poultice, plaster the nose with camphor paste, or with an infusion of rose oil into olive oil, or moderately from urine.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If nevertheless an abscess does not occur hot, then it is necessary, to plaster him with aloe flour, and powder made from thyme with powdery snail.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft wadding on it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If indeed the bones of the nose are fractured slightly or broken, then it is necessary to cut them off and extract them with the suitable instruments.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew the cut, and take care of it together with what promotes flesh formation and consolidation from suitable plasters, or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If an ulcer occurs in the nose, then it is necessary to take care of it with lime and administer a lead pipe until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Section on the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and the fracture is not accompanied by an ulcer: then observe if it is a fracture of the external part only, and does not break into two parts, and heals towards the inside. Then knowledge of it is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is in the right part of the jaw, you should insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth: similarly, if the fracture is in the left mandible, then insert your right hand's index finger. And push it together with that towards the external side with ease, and from there with your other hand you will center the part from the internal part of the bone, making it even.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer an extension from both sides according to straightness, until such time as equality becomes possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If indeed there is already disturbance or breakage in the teeth, then bind those that you hope will remain with the thread of gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place the saw over the broken mandible.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over it a double layer of cloth, and place over the cloth a large center-cut piece of leather: or a piece of equal size from the heel skin, with a length equivalent to that of the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it from above, according to how the preparation of the binding for you and its compatibility with application is done, until it does not cause destruction. And advise the patient to eat gently with tranquility and rest. And provide him mild sips of food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If however you think that something is being altered by some means to the figure, then act quickly and free it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been altered from that, and plaster it with powder from the mill, mixed with saliva or with millet flour, after you have used the saw: and place over the plaster a soft wool.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While then that plaster remains attached to it, and does not alter the arrangement of the bones, remove it, do not free it until it heals: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	Indeed, this kind of fracture is bound for three weeks multiple times.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If meanwhile an abscess should occur, then administer what we said to be done many times during its treatment, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, consider it carefully.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	If indeed the fragment has already separated from the bone, or from the skin: then consider this carefully, to remove that fragment of the skin with what is suitable for you in its removal from the tools.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If the wound's opening is tight, then enlarge it with a phlebotome according to your need's quantity.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you have removed that much, and nothing remains from them, or then if the wound's opening is large: and if it isn't, place upon it substances suitable for this, and harden that until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	¶ Regarding the restoration of the furca (a type of forceps) when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Title VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the furca (a type of forceps) is often broken at the anterior part from the side of the humerus, and its breakage occurs according to one of three methods.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or indeed it breaks and separates into two parts, beyond which there may be some resistance: and this makes its restoration easier.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or perhaps because of happening within the bone: and this makes its restoration more difficult.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or in this way, which is a break accompanied by a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in this case when there is a break without a wound, is that you should have two assistants present. One of them holds the tool that follows the broken furca, and the other extends their neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the break with your fingers until its shape is formed as needed: and do not allow any prominence or depression in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then you should place under the protruding part of a small sphere made from cloth or wool. The size of this should be according to your needs: extend and lift the furca, and hold onto the sphere with your hand until it equals out the break as needed.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot draw the extremity of the Scapula towards the outside: because it has reached depth, then the patient should be laid on top of his/her own neck. Place the middle pulley underneath one of its shoulders with about the size of a fist, and press the attendant's shoulder downwards until the point that is in depth rises up to the surface. Then correct the fracture and adjust it using your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel the clavicle moving and a popping sound when you move it, then you should hold over it and extract the fracture with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is held within the bone, then you should use your skill in making an incision with one of the prepared incisors you have ready for this. After placing the device that holds the scaphoid under the clavicle: and the device is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It becomes like the ear which does not have a hollow.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to that which you need it from the size of the bone and its firmness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	As for its length, even adjust it according to what is possible for you for the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And may it have two ends, as you see: and one of the ends be broad, and the other be narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the fracture is wide where you cut it when you extracted the bone of the fracture, and you prepare it with a hot iron: then join two layers of skin to this wound with stitches.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the fracture is small, or you fear an abscess may form: then fill the wound with bandages and grains according to the size of the cut in the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If an abscess becomes hot, then immerse a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	If it is indeed a stricture of the bone without wound and without sectioning, then you place plaster made from mill flour mixed with alkali on the mouth.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft wax over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under the nipple if you need that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take the hemeatom, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which should be extremely long; and its width should be one hand, or roughly like that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a double thread of wadding over the wax and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take an astral stone from a thin plank whose width is three fingers and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then fold the cloth with the astral stone over the place where it falls on the fracture and the spot.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the hemeatom over the fracture as it is rolled, and fold it over his neck, and under the nipple on him who is healthy, and under the nipple of him who is sick: and make her lie over all parts, and as you see that the stricture holds the fracture in its proper place: and this is what does not hide itself from you, and all together, so that it may not be removed astral stone from under the broken mouth.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, you must observe the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Therefore, whenever the ligament softens and you see that the astral stone has already been removed, then straighten it out, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sick person on their back and put beneath its belly at night a small amount of milk, so that when it sleeps, its helper will be lifted from its side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore, the fracture of the sternum should be treated by lifting the humerus.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Alternatively, fasten the arm to the neck: and do not loosen the bandage if no accident occurs due to itching or dislocation, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the dressing if you see that his face is turned towards this.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And apply in the fold, and release him until he recovers and clots.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	The fracture of the sternum is bound and strengthened for the most part within twenty-eight days, and sometimes it occurs in some people in that lesser span.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Chapter: Restoration of Fracture with a Spoon
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rarely does the spoon fracture and at its broad part; it is not fractured from there except from its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	So when it fractures from that place and fractures in the middle of it, and this is not known unless by touch; then according to what the shape of the fracture is, attempt preparation for it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And return it over to the natural shape in every way that your ingenuity allows, which is possible to you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place over the site grain powder with alkali and a soft soap, and then place above that lint flour from folded cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place over it a broad piece of thin plank according to the size of the spoon or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If there is an indentation under the star (the surgical instrument) in certain places of the spatulaes, then equal that indentation with soft wax, until the star descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then cut from above with an Algerian razor, according to the size and firmness of the star, until it cannot be moved from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And examine the ligament every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the ligament softens, tighten it, and if the star is moved from its place, equalize it: and let him lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is indeed restored within twenty days, or within twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number has been completed, then release the ligament: and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose union is not feared, nor their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however it proceeds from a fragment of bone and pierces under the skin: then cut above it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said about the fracture of the humerus through cold setting, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	¶ On restoration of fractures in the Chest.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in the middle of its own extent, and it is rare for this to happen.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The extremities of the chest indeed break and crumble from accidents related to it.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When the middle part of it breaks and tilts downwards, causing sudden pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing. And possibly vomiting blood, a depression is revealed in the broken bone, which cannot be hidden by touch, its restoration is such that he should lie on his infirm side, and place under his chest's back Spatulas.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his ribs, and join the ribs from both parts or sides with hands: and refine in the equation of him, according to every possible manner that this may fit until the shape of the bone returns, as it should.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and grease over him, and place a layer of thin wood chips from an almond tree or ash, or similar substances in thickness, after you have enclosed it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then refine the method of binding it over the broken mouth so that it doesn't move, and proceed with the binding according to roundness several times along the back, and tighten as is fitting.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the binding at every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it again. If necessity prompts for its release due to itching, corrosion occurring in that spot, or pain or pustule: then act quickly, release it, remove the plaster, and correct what happens according to the way of treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster if you see it fitting towards that, and attach a binding until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	Paragraph: About restoring broken ribs.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that the breakage of ribs does not occur except in broad areas following the back, and from their extremities towards the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it doesn't happen due to friction on them, except for that reason because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from touch during examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration is done in such a way that one compares the fracture with fingers according to possible methods, until the shape matches as it should.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply a plaster, and if needed bind the broken mouth with a star-shaped strip.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the breakage is downward towards the interior: then the sick person experiences sharp pain and puncture, as happens to someone who has pleurisy. Therefore, because the mouth pierces the mucosa and also causes difficulty in breathing, along with coughing and vomiting of much blood: this is a difficult treatment.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients have been ingenious in this matter with many devices: among them are those who say that you should feed sick pregnant people to cause inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflamed, stretched, and pushed by the breakage towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we abstain from it, so as not to be the cause for making a hot blister if it does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	And if it has already occurred, then one adds to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: place something windy over the area, then squeeze it with strength, and this is similar to their reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, there's concern that the wind might attract excesses to the area due to the weakening condition of the individual.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it should be covered with wool that is already immersed in hot oil: and the needles should be placed between the ribs until it's filled: so that when you unwind it, it becomes a bandage of equal size.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then, the sick person is treated with the care prescribed for pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the sick person is excessively restricted, which they do not tolerate, and their mouth pierces the mucosa with an irritating puncture, we fear for the sick person. In that case, it is necessary to cut above the area and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then place upon it the instrument which preserves the saw cut, whose description precedes: and enter the mouth with ease, and enter it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we will unite the two lips to the wound if there is a large suture: and treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	But if a hot abscess occurs meanwhile, then proceed, and pour the powders into rose oil, and place it over the area: and the sick person will be treated in accordance with the treatment of abscesses.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	And during this time, it is also bandaged over what lies on the side until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	Paragraph 4: Restoration of fracture of the Spondylial column and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, fractures occur in the cervical vertebrae sometimes and rarely due to rubbing. And similarly, they also occur in the thoracic vertebrae.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	So when such a thing happens to someone and you want to know if it will heal or not: then trust in this.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see their hands already softened, stunned, and dead; and they cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you squeeze them with your fingers and prick them with a sharp object, they do not feel that and do not feel pain in them: then you will know that they are not healing and that there is death in various positions.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them and feels constriction and piercing with fingers, then you will know that the neck of the bone is saved, and that the sick person will heal with healing.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	And if it happens similarly in the thoracic vertebrae and you want to know if they will heal or not: then consider his feet. And if you see that they are softened, and this occurs in them as with hands: then when lying on their back, a breeze and weakness occur without意愿. And when turned onto their stomachs, weakness occurs without意愿. And when turned onto their backs while wanting to move, but cannot: then you will know it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, no efforts are made in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If indeed nothing from that happens to him, then it is a lighter matter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for him of what happens from that is like pressing out a distillation with warm vinegar: do so as to place on top of rubbed spines only rose-oil. Or, if you prefer, with oysters you can satisfy yourself.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place that on it several times a day until the warm lump is calmed down. Then place one of the patches for strengthening and drying in that spot, then bind it with a bandage over it. And advise the patient to use it in peace and calmness.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Do not let him sleep on the part where he finds pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If during the rubbing of a bone it becomes loose or if anything comes off from it; then you must remove over the skin and take that away.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bind two lips of the wound together if it is large with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for him until he is healed using some kind of ointment.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the last of the bones breaks and it is the end of the tail: then you must insert the index finger of your left hand into the anus, and equalize the broken bone with your other hand as much as possible, and do so again in this way.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place it over him and remove it; and care for the wound with the treatment that preceded it until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	¶ On the restoration of the tail.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely do the bones of seals break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are broken, then their fracture is not, unless the break occurs at their extremities. And they split longitudinally and incline towards the interior. And a patient experiences pain at the site, along with punctures, and the leg that is broken becomes swollen.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And indeed, its restoration is to place your hand on it until you are positioned over the break such that you feel the shape of the break.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	And if the fracture is only at its extremities, then equalize that break according to how you prepare it from an equation, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	And if the fracture occurs longitudinally or instead inclines towards the interior, then have the patient lie on its abdomen until you prepare for you the restoration of that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have equalized it, place plaster over it. Then place a piece of wood or skin over it, and tighten the bandage without fearing deformation of the fracture or removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the curvature with what fills it up until he receives it by the bandage according to equality. And instruct the patient to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If however, a hot pus occurs to him, then stop the extension of it and its restoration until the hot pus settles. And place over what settled what settled as follows, and then return to restoring it, and tighten it as it should be tightened.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If however, there occurs an injury in the bone or it gets broken, remove it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	¶ On the restoration of fractures Assistant's (method).
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	This aid is that which is between the elbow and up to the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	Of which there is one: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligatures are tied at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then let it be suspended from an elevated place: and let the patient sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then let him extend his broken arm over the wood until he reaches its tip, in which there is a curved part of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then let something heavy be suspended above him so that he stretches his helper downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor equalizes the fracture with his hands until the break returns, as it should.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And the other method is for the patient to be supported over his own neck: and have his hand suspended from his own neck with a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two attendants, one of them to hold that which is above the fracture with their hands, and the other to hold below him, each extending towards their own part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish for a stronger extension, then tighten beneath the fracture with the ligament, and above it with another ligament: and each of the two attendants should extend those things towards their own parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is close to the elbow end of the arm, then one ligament must be placed under the tip, and another under the fracture towards the bend of the upper arm.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is close to the bend of the arm: then a ligament must be placed over that place, and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then make an equal break with ease without effort, until the break equals what it should according to need, and applies properly: then bind it, if no pus occurs from a hot dressing.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If indeed a hot pus does occur, then release the bandage until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on it wool that has absorbed pus in vinegar and rose oil, until the pus stops: then bind it; and the way to bind it is to put a plaster over the break.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place an unwoven new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Next, bind the arm to the helper and place her hand open on her shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, then bind the arm to the helper so that the arm stands in the place of the stars: unless something prevents you from it, nor let anything come from the broken bone towards you.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	But if you fear that something might come from the broken bone towards you, then use stars: and it is to place over the break a star which is wider and stronger than the other stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place the width of each finger between all stars; and let the length of the stars according to the break with an addition of three fingers from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind it over the stars with the constriction that I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your bandage should be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And as much longer the fracture gets extended, the constriction should be smaller.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	And if you see the stars and bandage as we have said, immediately upon restoring the limb in its place, then do this: and if you fear a hot pus, then release the bandage and stars until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then examine the ligament on all three days, so that no itching, swelling occurs, or food is prevented from reaching the member due to the constriction of surplus strain.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore correct that whole thing according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed it is about trust, so that nothing comes from it: then do not release the bandage until three days have passed or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient sleep on his back, and place his hands on his stomach: then place him under the support of an evenly filled wool cushion.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And examine at every hour of the night or day to ensure that the shape of the broken limb is not released and that the bandage does not become soft.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore correct that whole thing with your virtue.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And provide the patient's food according to the order we prescribed, so that initially there should be a delicate food until the mouth begins to chew: then it will be necessary to thicken their food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	Indeed, according to the custom of the assistant and the thigh, it should be tightened for forty days: so then it must be released, and a bath should be given, and treated with ointment that corrects this.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture has been contaminated, clean it: then do not release that bandage and splint for up to fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	### Restoration of the Fracture of the Arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones which are named the two humeri.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Which one is short: and this is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it's that which is positioned under the smaller one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore, the larger or the smaller tile is broken with the tongs, or the smaller one. And perhaps they are both broken.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	So when the smaller tile is broken with the tongs from above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when it is broken with the tongs from below, its breakage is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	It is worse, when two bones break at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	So if the bone that is broken is by the tongs slightly from above, then it befits the doctor in its restoration, to put a slight extension with ease until it gets used.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if the bone that is broken is by this large thing: then it must put a stronger constriction greatly.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he puts the hand shape at its restoration, and his extension above the pallet.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all fingers: and let there be a joint below all fingers or remaining things: and let the patient sit cross-legged on himself, and have the pallet before him, or directly above his own place, at its height, so that the patient does not suffer through any trouble.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the attendant extend the arm from the lower part or with his hand, or with the help of a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another attendant should extend it from above in the same manner.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor should align the bone until it returns to the best shape as possible according to what he can manage.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are gaps in the fracture of bones, then try to reduce every fragment to its place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If it appears that there is a hernia separated in him, and if you are stabbed by the skin, and there is no hope of his restoration: then bind upon him, and remove him according to the method we said about those which were previously mentioned.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If it's a fracture with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter for that, so take the treatment of that from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	And if a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your recovery, then soak linen with camphor made from rose oil and white wax, and let it have a medium thickness between thickness and fineness. Then bind the linen over it tightly for as long as the abscess subsides. When that happens, remove the camphor and apply prepared plaster made from cornmeal mixed with egg whites.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place splints; the splint placed over the fracture should be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in many arrangements: whether there's a fracture in one bone or in two bones at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage over the fracture site stronger and tighter, and a little more with the bandage towards the superior fracture or towards its inferior side: or place a softer bandage according to how it was recalled at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that cover the fracture be soft and dampened: and do not let them be hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which you bind be from linen appropriately, of a medium thickness between fine and coarse, as we have told.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and the ligament after a day.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	And if something happens that requires correction, such as itching in the member: then you must soak the member with heated water until that itch subsides, and remove the not-bound part of the member until it is at rest, then repeat the bandaging.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If now the constriction has become softened, and the mouth is already removed, and similar matters: then correct that whole thing with your strength, and re-evaluate.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	If alimentation is prohibited from reaching the member due to excess constriction, then it must be made slightly softer and allowed to rest for a few days until the nourishment reaches it again. Afterwards, tighten it once more.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, none of what we said happens to the sick person, then it should not be let out until after twenty days, or around that time.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then, hang the patient's hand onto their neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be equal to it, and protect it from vigorous movements with its strength.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And have him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored within thirty days or thirty-two days; and perhaps it may be restored within twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	The whole of this follows the principles of anatomy, and the principles of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	¶ Concerning the Restoration of Fractures (of the Hand).
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	And know that the wrist of the hand and the joints of the fingers rarely suffer fracture.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to it except through repeated rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When then a fracture happens to the sole or due to rubbing: then it should be that the sick person sits square: and let there be a seat for him in front according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	And then the servant should extend the broken bones, and the physician should equalize them, until they are joined in good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it should apply a poultice and fat, if no pus appears hot.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Next, place the lint above according to the size of the area: and you have already enclosed it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however the fracture is towards the lower parts around the heel, then make a similar sphere out of cloth: and instruct the patient to bind it over her broken foot with its plant: then tie it up with a long piece of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the lint be from the skin (of an animal), where there is softness, so that the skin can be applied to the foot's heel: then tie it up as needed.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If however the fracture is towards the outer side, then it should be that you place a lint above and another one from below on the heel: and let your hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Next, apply a bandage as the hand is turned: and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a fracture occurs to one of the joints in fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be adjusted according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind it with the heel: and if you like, place a flat and wide lint for him, so that the fracture may be lifted and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If however the fracture is to the remaining fingers like the middle one and the index, or the ear one and the ring finger, then it should be adjusted, and bound with the healthy finger that follows after it: or they are all bound according to their continuation: and it's better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place over him a wide lint as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And when you are considering your restoration and after that arrangement make pus appear hot: and put whatever is needed against it, according to what needs to be reported about the process.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the Restoration of the Hips Fracture.
Caput XV.	Head十五.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often broken, and this can be felt: because it turns towards the inner and posterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And the restoration of this is done like this, which is binding above the fracture the ligament and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick person is laid down on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then extend every supporting ligament to its own part according to equality: and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if the fracture is near to the root of the hip bone, then have the ligament towards the part of the ilium, so that the extension goes upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly if there is a fracture near the knee, then have the ligament near the knee, so that the extension goes downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician aligns the two bones with his hands until he can reduce them according to the likeness of a natural figure: and the mouth is united by good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it must be that you apply plaster and bandaging if no abscess occurs in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If an abscess occurs there: then let him rest for a few days until the hot abscess subsides, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	And his bandaging should be like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It must be that you fold over above the fracture an extra hard one, that is, a bandage: and double it twice or thrice: and there remains excess from that.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then fold down the calf until the heel reaches the root of the birth side.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And introduce a long thread between the ischial tuberosity and the thigh near the knee towards below, and let the ends of the thread emerge from the upper part of both parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Next, roll over the thigh and ischial tuberosity that extends beyond the suture line.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Next, place on the ischial tuberosity at the site of the fracture stars, and place one star above the knee hole.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Next, fill in the gaps between the thigh and ischial tuberosity with soft bandages, so that they match the tension.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Next, start with strong tension from the middle over the site of the fracture in three involutions, or four.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you extend with the ligament from the site of the fracture, the lesser and softer your tension will be, and it will become gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Next, guide to the two ends of the thread you introduced between the ischial tuberosity and the thigh.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	So bind with each of them three stars that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Next, guide the two ends of the thread towards below until you reach the bone of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with each, also pull the ends of the stars from the other side: so that the ligament does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then relieve the tension on that, while it remains, so as not to cause any erosion of the limb, nor a pustule, nor swelling, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything from this occurs.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	So when it comes to treating the situation and correcting whatever happens there, do as we have instructed many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If there is a fragment of bone sticking out from the bone that pokes: then you should equalize this if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find over it and remove it: and watch together with him who precedes recall, until he is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this thigh bone fracture is tightened, beyond which additional pieces are added to it, as we said about the assistant and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	But truly, during its restoration, such a broken leg does not cause an infirm person to limp.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, beyond which the other leg is applied to it, then that person must always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you should know that the thigh is tightened in fifty days, or it is added a little, or it is reduced a little; all of this depends on the variety of constitutions and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	¶ On the restoration of a fracture of the tibia.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	And you should know that fractures of the knee joint are rare, but they occur due to repeated rubbing.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	And if indeed a fracture occurs, then it is either a crack or an aperture in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	This can be like a wound and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands over that whole with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that what was broken from its parts with the fingers until it is gathered and united as much as possible according to the possibility of equality and ease, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then apply a plaster made from millet flour or miller's flour mixed with egg white. And place a round piece of metal on top if needed. And tighten it with a bandage that agrees with this.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the positions that we have discussed in other fractures: like hot poultices and similar things: thus, use each of them against every incident according to what suits him until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Chapter on Restoring the Break of the Thigh Bone.
Caput XVII.	Title XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You know that the thigh bone consists of two bones; one is thick and it is named as the thigh bone. And the other is thin, and it is named as the shaft.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens that each of these two types of fracture corresponds to the two bones in the arm: thus, its restoration is like the restoration of the arm, and the operation for both cases is the same.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones break at the same time, the thigh becomes all parts of its anatomy.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thinner bone breaks, the thigh turns towards the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone breaks, you find that it is below; and those things will not be hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then apply the extensions, equalization, and star ligature according to this method equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the thigh bone is a foul one with many symptoms, it should have a greater extension and gentler equalization on your part.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	Indeed, in the thigh there is something superior to the arm with respect to operation: and it happens that when you equalize the stars and complete all your operations, then take two strips of wood from pine wood which are used in making solar instruments placed under the boards. And these are made from palm spatulas. Choose among them those which have a fine thickness and are not too thin ones, and do not pick any from the finer ones. The length of these should correspond to the length of the thigh bone from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap each piece of linen twice spirally according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the thigh bone at one end, and the other part at the other end: and let them be from knee to foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then ligate two bandages in three places from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	And indeed when no constriction is allowed, the thigh bends to the right and left, and stands in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed, a cubital (support) is given from wood according to the length of the thigh, and it is placed under the thigh so as to preserve it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed, it is very necessary that you do this in the fracture when there is a wound properly.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then examine the thigh every day, and as diligently strive with it in the last from stiffness, or swelling, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	And if anything happens from those things, then oppose it with what is necessary for it until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Regarding the fracture of bones in the foot and digits.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, it does not happen that a fracture occurs entirely in the heel bone.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, fractures occur in the bones of the foot sometimes, and even to a lesser extent in digits: and they do not happen to them except with friction in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	Now if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and you see those bones rise up upon themselves, then let the patient place his foot on prepared ground as he would walk.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand, and place your foot on what rises from those bones. Afterwards press it, or put the heel there: and level it until it returns to its own places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply the plaster and put on suppurating (presumably referring to a poultice or ointment) above it: and place under the foot a thin board, which should have two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tie it with the foot at a suitable constriction, after you have enclosed it with cloths and all else that it requires.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	And when three days, or four, pass after her, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find that the bones are equal, or if they are broken, or if they are dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Therefore, the operation is for them, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if some of the fingers are broken, then restore them and equalize them according to what I have told you about restoring fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a stone on your finger according to the length of the finger, and make it slightly wider than that; then place under the foot this slab as I told you, and tie it with a bandage at a suitable constriction.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	But if what breaks is from the bones being two, or three, or more, then place on each finger a stone of its size, wrapped in linen cloth: and tie the slab under the lower foot: and let it stand above one head of the slab outside the belly of the foot, so that it may hold well by retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it befits you not to forget to consider all that I have told you about the rest of the fractures due to accidents which we mentioned, and to compare each accident with what should be done.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	¶ Concerning the fracture of the vulva in women, and of the vertebrae, and of the staff in men.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XVII.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is broken, then make her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her towards the back part of herself slightly, and let it be maintained backwards.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife fills the uterus of the patient with her hand until she fills it and forms a sphere out of it within the uterus.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman is squeezed and her back is gradually raised.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For thus it pushes out through the hand until it reaches before the door of the uterus like a sphere, and then the broken mouth returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a stick on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When the time comes to bear, remove her hand with ease and then she will give birth: and return it according to how you first inserted it. Then return back to the original stick.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do this for seven days or approximately, as its mouth heals.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if necessary, take a poultice of urine and press it over the opening of her catheter made from reed, then insert the whole poultice into her uterus.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow through the catheter with strength until the poultice inflates inside the uterus, for then it will return.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill with her hand and stand for some days, as we have told you, until she is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the mouth breaks with the aid of the tool of the man or woman, then administer in its restoration and with his/her own equation, as we have told you in the bone of Anchae.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not concealed in these rare breaks that occur, particularly for those who have some interest or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	Understand this book of mine for it is very important because the act itself of breaking teaches you many ways to correct and tighten your condition during restoration. Therefore, understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	And when the tool of the man breaks it, take the throat from the goose: and insert the tool into him.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place upon him an involution from cloth, and it will be wrapped, and removed after three days, or approximately those days, and he will be healed if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Regarding the restoration of bone fractures, when there is an incision.
Caput XX.	Head 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is necessary for him who encounters a fracture with an incision, especially if it's large like the pelvis, or hip supports, or something similar, to get ready and perform bloodletting immediately: if they inform you of the conditions for bloodletting as we have instructed previously.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound is bleeding blood, then you should proceed to its amputation, in such a way that you pulverize over it ground as directed: if there isn't another option available to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not delay this task if no abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If however an abscess appears hot, then discontinue the restoration of it until the sixth day, until the abscess settles.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth day completely, for you will cause him to happen bad accidents.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If however the fractured bone is elevated above the skin: then you must use your hands to reduce it, and equalize it with ease and slight stretching.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If however the extension of it is not prepared and its equalization is not done with your hands: then reduce it with this tool.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the tool is made from iron, whose length is seven or eight fingers in size, and its width matches the size of wounds.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of this, it is necessary for the doctor to take three or four from them, according to the amount he needs for every kind of treatment in all cases of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round. And within it, there should be thinness such that upon compression above it at the time of operation, it does not double. And let its extremities be sharp, with margins along their own edges.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part, in relation to thickness, extend from the middle of it down to its lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, it is necessary to place the sharp curved end of its tool over the protruding end of the bone and push them together as one until when the bone returns and aligns with an equation.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, try to make the ends of the broken part equal to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the ends of the broken part are subtle and do not accept good reception by that tool, then it is necessary to cut into that bone until the tool has power over its end.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce them with what we have been explaining entirely, then cut it together with whatever suits it from the incisions we mentioned: or saw it together with any number of saws that can be done for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then grind the remaining part in the bone from its roughness and fine layers.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	Therefore, when the bone is reduced and a severe pain is felt after its reduction by an inexperienced person, you will know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	So do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great assistance to the invalid when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse a cloth in wine that has been steeped, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And properly if it is in the summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place a thorn over the wound, nor anything that contains oil: so as to avoid causing decay and corruption within it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	And administer astellas at your time of day's completion, after the bone restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And remove the detected wound: so that when you use needles, you will have an opening through which to pass them according to the amount of injuries.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with every caution, do not tighten the wound during fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times this has been done by foolish doctors: and it caused harm to their sick, either death, or corruption, or putrefaction, which means disease.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your pressure be soft, gentle, different from the rest of the pressures on the remaining fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad or it's a large wound and you're concerned about certain harmful events that we mentioned which result in pain being felt in an elevated area; then it should not be necessary to place needles over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And perform evolutions with hard cloth strips in the area of the needles, and apply pressure to them afterwards.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	And when the wound begins to heal after a day or two, and you notice that pus is forming within it: then remove the cloth you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	And then apply linseed and smear with the ointments we habitually use for treating wounds: like the tetrpharmaceutical balm, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is appropriate for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every day upon waking and before going to bed, until it has healed completely.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it should be prepared in such a way for the member, that the pus can drain out of it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If several days pass and the wound does not heal, and pus cannot be drained from it: then you will know that there are minute bones there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore, you should inquire about the wound with your hand.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	For as many of those minute bones are separated from it, remove them and pull it out yourself.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And which of them are not separated and pierce the member, causing pain to occur, try to incise them, and remove them in every way that is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	And if a rash or ulceration occurs, or a putridity and corruption of some sort, then you should oppose each one with what suits it from treatment, as is mentioned in the chapter detailing its previous account.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from this point where my speech must stand, and when you make your current judgment regarding it if the mouth breaks and extends over the member, like the hip bone or helpers and similar parts of large members, do not assume a pull on it, for it often results in death. Instead, let it proceed until it putrifies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Therefore, take care of the wound if you see it: and otherwise, let it go its own course.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	[Section Title: On the Treatment of Nodule Formation during Bone Fracture.]
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This nodule formation occurs many times during the healing process of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Primarily, which is near sutures: and it is made from that member figure.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the body from performing its natural action.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider this when the operation is recent: administer medicines that promote healing and scab formation, such as aloes, frankincense, myrrh, collyrium, acacia, and similar remedies.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So take some or all of these remedies and mix them with astringent wine, egg whites, or vinegar. Place the mixture on top of the healing mass (nodation) covered by bandages and secure it properly over it.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And remove the bandage, do not change it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then change it, and apply another one until the healing mass is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or secure over it a sheet of lead bent in half.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the body.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the healing mass has already turned into a stone and is bound up securely, and necessity prompts you to remove it: then place something from above her/himself on top of it, and cut off the overhanging part. Or shave it with some razors until it is removed: and take care until she/he is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	¶ For the treatment when restoration occurs and the body remains after this delicate operation, not according to its natural disposition.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the break of the bone is restored and the body remains delicate, weak after this operation, then it is not due to many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of these is that there was too much solution of the ligament and its ligation not according to what should be done: or due to an excess of bandage compression preventing food from reaching the body until it is forbidden; or due to a surplus of ointment application at the wrong time: or due to lack of blood in the weak body, and its debilitation.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	The treatment for this is to feed the sick person and make its body tender until the blood multiplies in it.
Et administra balneum.	And give a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and mirth upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pepper on the member: so that it attracts pus towards the food for much nourishment.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And apply his ointment with warm water until the nourishment is restored and returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	¶ For the treatment of fractured bones when they are bent.
Caput XXIII.	Title XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a member, already restored after its healing, has the distortion and elevation of the broken bone or lump, and is hindered by this from assuming its form; but the member is not prevented from performing its natural function: then there is no need to listen to the advice of those who think that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And many foolish physicians and restorers have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is very blameworthy, leading to death or great fear, indeed it results in a mortal outcome.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	However, if the limpness and lump are recent: then it should be treated with warm water in which soothing herbs have been boiled, like the leaves of aletris, and its root, and meadow clover, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And make him a poultice with a soothing plaster, like that made from dock root.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucus of the root of aletris and mix it with chicken fat or safflower oil: and apply it as a poultice.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	They take large figs and bruise them with birdlime and similar things which are called for diminishing adhesion in medicines.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knot is dissolved with frequent rubbing, old and gentle, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movements of the member are administered to every part at all times.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If however the tortuousness has already come before and made it strong and turned into a stone, and provoked necessity for its treatment with iron: then it is necessary that it be cut higher, and the continuity of the bone be resolved, and what exceeds from the knot or bone be removed with fine incisors: and ease should be administered to it with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	¶ On speaking about dislocations.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	A dislocation is the outcome of some joints being moved from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Hence movement is prohibited from its own position, and the shape of the limb is disrupted.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes to occur over the weak pains and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	So when a dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hasten the restoration of it: there should not be a total delay in doing so.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place gets stuck and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, one should not move or stretch during the time it is stuck, for that reason.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	As it often causes cramps and painful injuries to occur.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when this happens, it is necessary to hasten towards bloodletting for the patient.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it is released until the pus rests.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member is immersed in warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then return it with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And each member is treated where its recall occurs in its proper place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed arranged the chapters on dislocation, even according to what precedes in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	### On the treatment of the lower jaw dislocation.
Caput XXV.	Title XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are rarely dislocated, except occasionally.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the teeth happens according to one or two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or perhaps they are removed from their places by a slight removal, and become slightly softened.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely by dislocation, until they soften to the part of the chest, until saliva from the patient flows out and he is unable to hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is hidden with his speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	However, when her dislocation is slight, then it returns in many positions by herself with scarcity.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if it is a complete, integral dislocation: then it must be that the reduction of her is quickly administered, and it should not be delayed entirely. And it is required that someone in charge of the sick person hold their head: and the doctor inserts his thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw between the mouth of him/her, if the dislocation is from one part.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he might insert both his thumbs at once, if the dislocation is from two parts.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And let the remaining fingers of his hand be outside those with which he equates.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the sick person to clean his jaws and lengthen them up to being able to eat everywhere.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor adjusts the jaw, and urges the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the return of it is difficult, especially if both jaws are at once: then administer vaporization with warm water and oil, until the return of the jaws becomes easy: do not entirely avoid a timely return of the jaws, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	So when they return and adjust themselves, and the mouth of the sick person closes, and does not soften: then place over them wool pieces with a wick that is made of wax: and an ointment mixed with rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it is bound with ease using soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the sick person sleep on his back: and his head be placed between two pieces of wool so that he does not move himself to the right or left: nor should he try, or be made to chew anything: instead, soft food is put for him until when the pains disappear and the jaw is fixed: then he can eat what he wants, and it should be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	And do not tire on the operation of his mouth at congestion and drink, and rocking, until the jaw is fixed and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the return of both jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some hour and do not return to their places, then fevers and continuous vomiting often occur. And perhaps the stomach of the sick person will be relieved, and perhaps it will vomit pure cholera.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you see that: then you will know that there is a loss, and many times that person dies when this happens within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the Reduction of Dislocations of the Furca and the Elbow Joint.
Caput XXVI.	Title XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The furca (or scapula) is not dislocated from its internal lateral side due to its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it may be dislocated externally, and this can be determined by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And the restoration method is for the patient to lie on his back, and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then try to restore the position by pressing with your hand, as it will return through its own force.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Next, place plaster and ointment over it, and bind them firmly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	As for the other parts of its extremities which follow the elbow and continue with it, they do not get dislocated except rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	Which does get dislocated on some day: then it should be reduced and levelled according to what we have said, and as what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place plaster and ointment over it, and apply bandages.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the patient to remain calm and still until they have healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with the same procedure, the elbow extremity is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the Reduction of Dislocations of the Shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Title XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the shoulder blade does not get dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of these is for it to be dislocated towards the lower part of the deltoid.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is for it to be dislocated towards the chest area.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps dislocation occurs above the upper part of the humerus: and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated at the back, due to the shape.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated at the front, due to nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And indeed, many of them get dislocated and come out towards the nipple: especially in those with little flesh.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it goes quickly outwards and quickly back in.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those with much flesh, the opposite occurs, that is, it comes out with difficulty and goes back in with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some individuals due to a blow or an accident, and the humerus gets displaced when heated, and is thought to have been dislocated because of that.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	So it is necessary to experience that until you are certain of its nature, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	Dislocation is known when it occurs towards the back of the body relative to the nipple: and you distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	You will find a clear difference between them and you will discover that there is a concavity in the head of the humerus, and upon touch it seems to be hollow as if part of its body is missing. And an invalid cannot bring his hand to his ear nor move it with all motions.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	Similarly, if it gets dislocated towards the chest or upwards, then you will find a clear palpation, which is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And indeed, this kind of dislocation has easy reduction when it is recent or the patient is an invalid child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, that the servant raises his hand to the higher ones.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under his tubercle and raise the suturing with strength upwards to its position: and the servant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then place it downwards, for he himself returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If however he does not return through that which we said and there are days at the beginning where a dislocation occurs: then it is necessary for the patient to bathe in warm water, and an application should be given that softens and soothes, just as if the roots of hyssop, and fennel, and sweet clover were steeped in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient is put to lie on his back: and under his tubercle a sphere and wool is placed which should be equal in softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor puts his heel on the sphere, and raises the head of the shoulder with strength, and draws the patient's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another servant holds the head of the patient so it does not move downwards, for he himself returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this manner: and it is that you should make the present man who stands longer than the patient, stand against the side part, and insert his shoulder under the tubercle of the patient: and raise his tubercle upwards until the patient is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another servant pulls the patient's hand downwards towards the lower part of his stomach.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If however the patient is light: then it is necessary to have something else hang with him in order to weigh him down: because the dislocation happens immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: and there is one where a piece of wood is formed on the ground that has a round shape as its head: like the handle of a mortar; which should not be thick nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then let there be placed under the weak person after placing soft cloths on top of the head of the wood. And make the weak person stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then extend his hand to the lower part from one side, and extend his body from the other side with strength: for the connection returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If the reduction of him is difficult through all that we have said, then use this care: and there is where you take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width is the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness is the quantity of two fingers: to which its head will be round, so that it may fit into the depth of the bed with its opening, according to this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then bind soft cloths over the round head so that they do not harm the weak piece of wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place the weak person under the bed so that the hand or arm can be extended over the wood up to the lower part: and bind the piece of wood on the support, the arm, and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm on the step of the ladder across its width, and extend the hand to the lower part, and let the rest of the body hanging from the other side be released.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	Indeed, the union takes place immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	And when the insertion of it has been completed according to whatever possible method: then it is necessary that you place under the bed a sphere of equal quantity made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then put on prepared plaster made of mill dust mixed with olibanum and egg white, covering the whole shoulder as it is rolled out above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten under the nipple for a proper bandage: and the ligament is moved over the plaster from above. And the hand of him is attached to the neck itself, and it is not moved, neither his hand during seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it should be that a small amount of food is placed for the sick few until the member is strengthened: because it is faster to its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then place a larger one after seven days or five, and let him exercise with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it becomes firm and does not soften, then he is now healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	However, if the joint is dislocated many times, due to moisture that happens to it or for another cause: then it should be treated with a cautery with three holes, according to what was presented in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If this is done completely, and the ligament is released after seven days, and the joint does not harden, and the plaster and bandage are applied repeatedly and do not firm up, and it falls and cannot be lifted to higher positions: then you will know that the nerves which are connected to the shoulder blade have either been cut or stretched, or made soft. And you will know that the joint will never set in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	The dislocation that occurs towards the chest and breasts, or backwards reduction, is done with a push and extension using hands until it returns. Afterwards, any remaining bandage and care are administered until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after healing heaviness occurs in the limb and tardiness in its movement, then the sick person should use multiple baths until that heaviness is alleviated and returns to their natural first state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	¶ On the treatment of the dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Title XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty. Indeed, it dislocates to all parts, but particularly towards the front or towards the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation will not be hidden from you: for it falls under the eye and under touch, being dislocated according to whichever figure [of movement] it is.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join together the dislocated elbow with a healthy one, this becomes clearly evident to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	Indeed, the joint is concave and cannot double the arm or touch its own shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you must approach and reduce the dislocation immediately before heat blisters occur.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if heat blisters occur to him, the reduction of it becomes difficult; and perhaps it will not be fully healed, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	Indeed, this is worse among all types of dislocations and comes with greater pain to them: and often death descends with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is possible to reduce from among those that are available, is: to extend his hand with both hands. And his arm must be expanded and the doctor's hands be above the elbow and under it, and he impels the joint with the fingers of his own hands simultaneously, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or otherwise the dislocation is towards the front: then return it in such a way that he doubles his hand with his own, until he strikes the elbow which is dislocated with the root of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a strong, powerful extension. And it is this: two attendants must extend their arms; and the two attendants also hold him, so that he does not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then cut the arm so that after folding over and covering his hand with a doubly layered piece of cloth or a broad ligament, every part is enclosed.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches his own suture with his hand, he should anoint it with oil: so that among those things which help in the smoothness of the suturing process with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then drive the suture forward with a strong thrust until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after reducing it, one must place on it a plaster where there is compression and drying with the help of sulfur: and the bandage should be tightened to a proper degree.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And hang the arm from the neck of the sick person: and release after some days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then release.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the suture becomes firm in its place, then release the ligament from it and release her.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the suture is not held well, then apply again a plaster and ligament, and release her for some days until it is tightened.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release her.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however weight falls upon her after the reduction of the suture and positioning is in motion: then administer moistening in bathing, and a subtle friction, and compression, until it heals, or place over the suture a paste, that is, a fatty testicle.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it should be bound and released upon her during the day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove her and immerse him in a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	And when he sweats, then rub the suture with a gently rubbed friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then apply one, and then two, and three tallow pastes together with immersion in the bath until they soften.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you want a wound, place on it a wad of dung, moistened and heated with butter, and bind it over.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	Indeed, it softens and returns to its natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	¶ On the treatment of dislocations by Al-Mhassem.
Caput XXIX.	Title XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Al-Mahassem often dislocates the hand, which is the joint between the upper arm and the forearm.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And reducing his dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	In contrast, for all other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the speed be present in reducing his hand dislocation at the time when he dislocates it, before the spot becomes fixed: or an eruption occurs there hot.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of his dislocation is to place Al-Mahassem's weak hand on a board, and have him extend the attendant's hand. And the doctor places his palm over the protuberance of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it must be considered if the hand has already retreated to the belly of the hand: then the infirm person places the back of his own hand on a board during extension and reduction. And if the dislocation proceeds towards the back of the hand, then the position of his hand is inherently on the board, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the board so that the doctor's hand falls over its own protuberance of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with plaster to cover the eruption. And release him, do not repeat that procedure.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it doesn't tolerate, you cannot continue with his reduction after days have passed, however the joint remains according to its curvature: and it does not harm the sick in any way, except that the hand softens, and she cannot bind anything. Then you will know that the nerves are cut or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore there is no skill in that, except when it is tightened with the cautery near the case of its own.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps this does not bring about anything significant.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	So when Almahassem does not return, then place over it the plaster, as we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then tighten it up, and let it go for five days: afterwards, open it and let it go, and exercise the hand.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if her movements are restricted and something becomes heavy there: then soften it with heated water, and perform friction several times, until it softens.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	### Instructions for the Treatment of Finger Dislocations.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from any part of it, or even towards the back of the palm, or belly of the hand: then extend the finger and push against the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns to its original position.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then hold the head of the finger, and hang it towards the part from which it is dislocated, and let it go for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang him up, and extend the finger until it is straightened out on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	So when it is night, bind him according to that same instruction: and do not stop releasing him each day; and exercise him with movement; and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Perform this for several days until it tightens.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same if it is dislocated towards the belly of the hand: bind it to that part and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do similarly with him when he is dislocated towards the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the treatment of dislocation of the lumbar vertebrae.
Caput XXXI.	Title XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When such an event befalls someone, whether it is a complete dislocation of the lumbar or cervical vertebrae, or many vertebrae are moved from their places: then there is no treatment for that, because death approaches the weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the weakness of the sick person escapes without his will, and he cannot hold it; and many times some parts of him soften from it, or both legs of him, or both arms of himself, or one of them: or one of the vertebrae is moved from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Indeed, it happens many times because the removal affects all four parts multiple times.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	So, that which is moved towards the back, is called Humpback.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment for it is to consider whether Humpback occurs during childhood: then there is no treatment for this, and there is no complete recovery from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	As for the one that occurs due to an accident, or impact, or by similar means, ancient people have already spoken at length about the methods of treatment.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which many do not return with beneficial results.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have indeed abbreviated it from that which slightly excuses much of its proximity to my intention and through the explanation I provided for it, and reshaped its tool in a different manner than they showed and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that there is no intelligence nor recovery from the humpback which occurs from the front part.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly with the one that happens to both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And shears are not used on them, except the one which happens precisely in the back, as I am narrating; and it is that the sick man lies face up on a flat board near the wall: and under him is spread a damp cloth so that his chest does not get hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight piece of wood is placed fixed in the ground at a corner of the board, near his head. Another piece of wood is set near his feet, at the other end of the board. The attendant holds the piece of wood, and it should not be firmly planted in the ground.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another attendant holds the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then cover the sick person's head, and bind his forehead loosely, firmly. Extend the end of the ligament towards the wood that is near his head and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then bind another ligament over his hips, and above the knees, and near his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligaments together, and bind them to the other piece of wood which is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then all the attendants should spread out over the wood where the ligaments are attached, and do not move the two pieces of wood from their places where they are fixed. However, they should not be firmly fixed as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place his hands on the Spondyles (a term used for vertebrae) with strength until he leaves them: or he can place them on that table.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then attach his feet to the table until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If however, he does not return through this cure, then take a table whose length is about three spans.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And dig in the wall as we said that is near the sick person, for where the end of the table can enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place a middle table above the Spondyle.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor place his feet on the other extremity.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And he should tighten it well until the Spondylus is compressed, and return to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then, if you have need, to operate with the return which is covered by your hand: and it is that you should prepare two pieces of wood at the end of each foot of the sick person, their length being equal to one arm; and also two pieces of wood at the head of the sick person at the end of each foot.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length be that which is between every piece of wood and one palm: and now a hole has been made in every place through which the return runs; and all the pieces of wood are fixed firmly in the ground, so that they will not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And the round piece of wood is inserted: and there is the return within which the ligament revolves in two holes of two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its extremity is a hole into which the wood is fixed, whose length is equal to that which revolves: and similarly at two other pieces of wood.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then, tighten the ligaments that you have tightened in the chest of the sick person which is at the head: and the ligaments that you have tightened in his legs are tightened in the return which is at the feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand by each return as a servant, who shall twist his hand with the licinus, with which the return revolves: and the doctor will balance the Spondylus, as we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the return, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	And after the Spondylus returns and balances its place, then it is necessary to apply a dried plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then the plug.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place above the plaster a star-shaped piece from a board, which width should be three fingers or roughly so.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is as much as it can take the place of Spondylitis, and over the part of healthy Thoracic vertebrae.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is fastened with the ligament that we said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the invalid uses fine nourishment until they heal.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If there remains some prominence in the site at the end of healing, then it is necessary that soothing and softening medicines be administered, with the use of the table which we described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now the lead sheet is administered there.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes a prominence occurs at the last thoracic vertebrae of the back: and it is thought that through this dislocation, and there is that which now emerges.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore, it should not happen to assume this with this medicine: perhaps it will result in death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	### On the treatment of dislocated Ankh
Caput XXXII.	Title XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the fracture of Ankh and the fracture of the humerus happens only due to dislocation and does not happen like other fractures due to small displacement and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed, the fracture of Ankh (Ankh is likely a term or anatomical structure in the context) occurs according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	This means, because it can be dislocated towards the front and towards the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And mostly it is dislocated towards the inside: and it is slightly dislocated towards the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment for his dislocation towards the inside is: because when you unite the diseased leg with a healthy one, it appears longer. And his knee is elevated more than in health, and he cannot bend his foot near the groin. And there's a place following the groin which follows the diseased bone warm by warmth, since the head of the thigh bone has already arrived there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign for him who suffers dislocation towards the outside is that his accidents are contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign for him who suffers dislocation towards the front is that his healthy leg extends up to a quarter-circle: however, he cannot bend it without pain in the knee. And if he tries to walk, he cannot proceed ahead of the affected area. He retains urine, and the groin becomes swollen. During walking, there is a heel strike due to his foot.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign for him who suffers dislocation towards the back is that he cannot extend his knee, nor can he bend it before the groin bends. His leg on the other side is also shorter. The groin becomes soft and the head of the thigh bone is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The treatment for this type of dislocation, however, is to consider when it occurs, whether the dislocation is new and therefore still present, or if it has already aged.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you perform the reduction and it remains according to its natural position, there is no cure needed for that.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it is not necessary for the assumption to be made entirely upon him.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In the case of one whose dislocation is recent and belongs to one of the four types of dislocation: then proceed in this way, trying to straighten it out, extending it both inward and outward, and moving it with your right and left hand. Perhaps it will return to its place without needing further treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If this method does not return the thing, then you must prepare a strong attendant and have him extend his leg from its lower part: either with his hands or with a ligament that is tied over his leg above the knee. And another attendant should extend his hand over it so that he can insert his hands under his nails.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Next, tie with a soft ligament to the coxal bone and hold the end of another's ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let the extension be either from the anterior part of the groin to the iliac crease, or from the posterior part to the dorsal region.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of all these be one by each until the patient is lifted up with their body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is the common form of all four species.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation comes back with what we said, it is good; and if not, then for each species, there needs to be that which I will say about its own treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the process of reducing it oneself when the dislocation is towards the inside, one must have the patient lie on their healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then place the ligament over the coxal bone, at the point where it is between the head of the coxa, and the place below the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upwards from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, towards the iliac crease.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong attendant should take the arms of the patient, and reduce the large place of the diseased coxa, stretching it outwards forcefully.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now it has returned to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this is the form of an easier method compared to others for treating and reducing this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If indeed there is an exception made for you and you do not obey this method of treatment at the entrance when applying to your case, then it should be that two crippled feet are bound simultaneously with strong ligaments, softer ones, above two heels, and above two knees: and let the length of each equal its own size up to four fingers: and let the leg of the sick person be extended further by an amount equivalent to two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the sick person should be suspended over the head of the wooden pole, which should be placed inside the house. And let its length reach up to two arms from the ground.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command the strong youth to protect the thigh's head and suspend him with the sick person. You find another: And have the other youth push, protecting the thigh with strength; for union returns to its place at speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	When it comes to correcting him to his own position, when the dislocation is towards the outside, you should have the sick person lie on a platform, as we told about in the one with humpiness.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And bind the ligament over his leg, properly to the sick one, and also over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then place two pieces of wood, one near his feet, and the other near his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then place an additional piece of wood in the middle of the foot, firmly fixed. Cover it with wet cloths so as not to hurt the sick person: and let the wood be between his thighs, so that it does not pull towards the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all assistants should extend to their respective parts and the doctor should adjust the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore he obeys in the reversal, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place her on the table and press her evenly as we said about humpiness.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	But nevertheless, it is necessary that the patient lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it is necessary that the physician quickly extend the diseased leg of the patient. And he follows this same description on a bench, and places his right hand's palm on the groin of the patient.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he constrains him with the other hand, and with that constraint, place him extended down towards the back to the knee area.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is towards the back, then it should not be that the patient extends down towards the back and is lifted above the ground. Rather, he should be placed on a hard surface as well, just as it would be necessary even when the outer part of his body is dislocated, according to what we said about him lying on both elbows. And he lies face up with extended ligaments, as we previously mentioned.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary to administer compression with the table even at the point where the joint protrudes, once the reduction has been completed as required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return should not be hidden from you: and it is that you extend both legs of the patient. And when you see them equal, and the patient grips his leg, and extends it without any discomfort: then you will know that the member has indeed returned, as required. Then join the two hips, and place the plaster, and compress with a bandage, that is, a hoop, so that the elbow does not move towards any part of the body, and the patient remains quiet for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then release the ligament and plaster, and compare the legs with each other. Then if you see them equal in position, then you will know that the dislocation is now stabilized: therefore allow the patient to walk accordingly.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see anything of softening: then return, and cover that with the plaster, and bind it according to your first constriction: and let even that be for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then release that and make it remain under walking for a couple of days, until it heals well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	¶ On Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Title XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee can be dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It can be dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and downwards, that is, towards the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not get dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	The sign of such a dislocation is that you will instruct the patient to apply their shin bone to their thigh bone.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not adhere with the thigh: then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	The restoration of all its forms of dislocation is to make the patient sit straight, so that they can now extend their shin bone if possible over it and adhere your back to their face; and place their foot between your own.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then adhere the knee of its owner with your palms, and place them straightly between your fingers over its knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Next, apply with your palm the two sides of its knee firmly.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another attendant will extend its foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	The sign of recovery is that the shin bone adheres with the thigh gently, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster it, and adhere the shin bone to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with bandages for three days or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then, release those things.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the patient not use walking for a certain number of days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if he refuses you to reduce it, then administer strong traction with ligaments, as was described in the treatment of the humerus, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	§ Treatment of Dislocation of the Calcaneous.
Caput XXXIIII.	Title XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneous (heel bone) is sometimes reduced with small displacement and at other times dislocated by the full amount.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation can happen either towards the inside or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the calcaneous swollen and moving towards the part where it is being dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment for correcting its displacement is easy and straightforward: it involves gently stretching it with your hands until it returns to its original position.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	During the treatment of this condition when it is fully dislocated, you should have the patient sit upright. And a strong attendant should hold the patient firmly from the lower part of his back, in the middle of him.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold his foot with your right hand from the upper part of his foot, and place your left hand under the heel (cauilla) of his foot.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with your left hand, apply two fingers.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend the foot with your left hand and push the front of the foot towards the shin with your right hand without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have instructed.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the front of the foot towards the shinbone at three-quarters position, and you pull the heel bone.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore she returns in the belly once, or in two according to this manner, and you see the foot level, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on him: because he returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however the return of it to you is prohibited with what we narrated: then make the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a stake firmly into the earth so that it falls between his buttocks: and you have already covered him with a cloth, so as not to harm the sick.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then take hold of the thigh of him [the patient]. Afterwards, the attendant shall extend another foot, either with his hands or with a ligament that is tied over the ankle bone.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then all the attendants shall extend against the comparison of their own extension: and the stake should stand between the two buttocks of the sick person, holding him so that his body is not drawn down towards the lower parts during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor adjusts the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant holds the healthy leg towards the lower parts.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with velocity.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When then the dislocation returns and its restoration is shown to you: then apply plaster and swaddling bandage, and bind it firmly with bands, and tie the foot with a band around the thigh.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And you must, perceive or feel the nerves that are above the heel bone, so that the bandage does not lie heavily on them and harm them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then release him for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the bandage softens, tighten it again: then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If one wishes to walk before that space, there is no certainty that it will not dislocate upon itself, and become corrupted, and does not receive treatment after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If an inflamed pustule should occur to him: then it is necessary that you administer the thing which precedes our narration in another place concerning treatment and ointment until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	¶ On Dislocation of the Toes, and Treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Title XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It should be done that what is dislocated from them is reduced with slight effort during extension; and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If the dislocation is in certain parts of the heel bone: then it should be that the patient sits with his foot on an equal place on the ground or on a table: and stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stand up, and place your foot over that which extends out from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then strike that with your foot with strength until it returns to its place, and you can feel it is correctly aligned, and no longer appears elevated in the location.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under his foot a table which holds the whole foot, having two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then apply a bandage appropriately for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then release him and make him rest from walking for many days until it is bound securely after reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	¶ On the varieties of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Title XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something like this happens and you attempt to treat it and restore him, many times death occurs. Therefore, one should not assume that his treatment is of this sort unless he is a prudent man skilled in the long practice of medicine, compassionate, pious, slow, not bold or presumptuous: and that he uses medicines for starting treatment which calm inflamed pustules only, and dismisses the patient according to divine judgement.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you have ideas, or hope for salvation from destruction with alleviation of illness, and in which there appears some hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, try to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot pus forms.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the member returns, according to what we wish, then administer a regime that calms the pus: and care for the wound with whatever is suitable for it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If there is a dislocation with fracture, and it happens in the case of bones separated from the articulation, then try to remove them, and do what we said about simple illnesses according to what precedes in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your virtue, and protect yourself from entering the path of fear: according to what preceded my prediction to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more beneficial to your body among them in your time.
