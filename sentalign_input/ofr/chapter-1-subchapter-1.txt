Of the olive-shaped cautery
This cautery is good for moisture and coldness on the brain, and there are two that are made for a disease called "soda", and for many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and especially for all diseases that come from coldness such as paralysis and lethargy and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The method for this cautery is that the patient be purged by a dissolving medicine cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength, age and constitution of the patient can bear; and then shave the patient's head.
Then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his chest; then place the base of your palm on the bridge of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle finger falls, bleed from there, then heat the cautery which is called "olive-shaped", of which this is the form:
And place it on the spot marked with ink, and make it descend by pressing your hand little by little while turning it; then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place to see if you see the bone just a little; and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you; then take a little salt, and put it in water and soak cotton in it, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then put on cotton soaked in butter; and leave it on until the burn is gone; then treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmakon", until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it is purged; and for this it helps to change dressings.
And some of these said that one should leave the cautery until part of the bone is burned, and then cut away what is burned from the bone, and it should be treated.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on, and push so hard that one lowers the bone as wide as a whorl that women put on their spindles so that the humors come out more easily; and one should leave the wound open for a long time; then one should clean and solder it.
And these two ways of cauterizing do not seem to me to be good at all, except in some men where there is a way of fear; and it seems to me that I should leave it; for the head is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we witness in other limbs; and even when the patient's head is naturally weak, the first type of cautery is safer and better for me, and this one I use in all work, with salvation.
