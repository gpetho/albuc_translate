Since I have completed for you, O sons, this book which is the last of the sciences in medicine with its complement, and having reached the end in it through its expositions and declarations, it seemed good to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of action, namely surgery with the hand.
For the surgery with the hand has been prostrate in our region and in our time it has been entirely private: until perhaps its knowledge has perished, and its track has been cut off; and nothing has remained of it save small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have been changed by hands; and error and hesitation have happened to them, until its intentions were closed and its sight prolonged. It seemed good to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise according to the way of exposition, and declaration, and abbreviation; and that I should come with forms of the tools of cautery, and other instruments of work: with is accomplished from the addition of declaration, and from its properation which is necessary.
Now the cause for which a good craftsman of it with his hand is not found in our time, is: because the art of medicine is long; and its author ought to exercise himself before that in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he know the joints of the members, and their forms, and their union, and separation, and have knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and sinews, and their number, and their going out; and of the pulsating veins, and quiet.
And on account of that Hippocrates said, That what is a name with a name is much; and with work is little; and especially in the art of the hand.Et propter illud faciendum est ut ueniat ad vos hunc liber de chirurgia cum manu, qui est secundum uiam ex positione, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et habeat vobiscum ordines operacionum et instrumentorum eius: et super iis quae sunt necesse, et qui non possunt habere cum se, ut possint ueniere ad vos per ordines istos.
We have already spoken about him at the beginning of this book.
For he who does not know what we have said about anatomy will never be purged but will straightaway fall into error, the kind that causes men to perish: as I have seen happen to many of those who are trained in this science, and boast of it without knowledge or experience.
Which happened because I saw a foolish doctor lancing an abscess on a woman's neck and cutting some veins in the neck; whereupon the woman's blood flowed until she died in his hands.Quod uero expositum est de faciendo in scrophulis, in capite etiam, et in ubere, omnia haec debent fieri cum magna provisione medicorum, qui habent experiensiam.
However, what has been said about abscesses in the head and breast should all be done with great care by doctors who have experience.And I saw another doctor who presumed to extract a stone from a man in old age; but the stone was large.
He went up to him therefore and extracted it with a knife.Et uidi alium medicum, qui praesumpsit ut curaret uiros clysteribus.
Why a man died on the third day.
I had indeed already been called to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
And I saw another doctor who was receiving a fee from a certain Duke in our land for his medicine; and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, that he had a fracture in his thigh near the heel: and the doctor with his ignorance bound up the fracture over the wound with poultices, and with strong bandages around the wound, and did not leave the wound open to breath.
Then he discharged him according to his desires.
Afterwards he dismissed him for several days, and gave him directions not to loosen the bandage; and he remained so until his thigh and foot became gangrenous, and reached a state of destruction.
I was therefore called to him; and I hastened to loosen the bandage; and there followed quiet, and he escaped from his pains.Et quilibet mirabatur de medicamentis nostris: et ex eo die uidebantur nobis omnes medici in urbe illa, qui videbant uigorem nostram et experientiam, et sciebant nos esse sapientes.
And every one marveled at our medicines; and on that day all the doctors in that town saw our skill and experience, and knew us to be wise men.But the corruption was already confirmed in the limb, and I could not restrain it.Et post octo dies uenit ad me pauper cum filio suo: et erat in pedere eius ulcus, quod non curabatur per multos annos.
The decay therefore ceased from wandering about in the limb until it was lost.
And I saw another physician who had punctured a cancerous ulcer and the ulcer got worse after a few days until its wickedness magnified with his lord.
This is because when a cancer is pure from a melancholy humor then no iron should be applied to it at all unless it is in a limb that can tolerate the removal of the entire tumor.
And because of this you need to know that an operation with the hand is divided into two divisions namely, an operation with which there is safety and an operation with which there is danger in many dispositions. And I have now exited everywhere in this book where there comes an operation with fear and horror.
Therefore you need to beware of it and remove it so that stupid people do not find a way to talk and dishonor the subject.Et quia in hoc libro multum est de ambiguis et obscuris uerbis, quae non possunt intelligi omnino, nisi expliciantur uersus:
And because there are many ambiguous and obscure words in this book which cannot be understood at all unless the verses are explained: Take therefore the measure with solicitude and protection and your sick with ease and firmness and use the better way leading by the grace of God to salvation and a laudable succession and leave behind you terrible diseases of difficult cure and remove from your souls what makes you afraid so that hesitation may enter into your faith and benefit. For it is more remaining to your glory and higher in this world and finally to your amounts.Et per hoc potestate est vobis, ut faciatis magis: et sic omnes cuncti cognoscant per uos, quod bene operatur salus a uiribus sapientibus et prudenter habens opera sua, cuius memoria perlongum tempus permaneat.
And for this you have the power to do more and thus everyone knows through you that salvation works well from wise men and discreetly holding his work whose memory remains a long time.For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions You shall not heal the bad sickness lest you be called evil physicians.Sed medicamini: et facite, ut saluti sint uobis homines, qui habent in domibus suis, ut omnes cognoscant, quod bene operatur salus a uobis.

¶ Of cauterization and harm: and with what complexions it suits, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold.
Ch. I.De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.
But before I mention the action of cautery and its harm, it is fitting that I should say something of the qualities of its instruments and its harms: and in what complexion it occurs.Nam quodam modo, qualitas ferri, vel auri, facit liuor praeter naturam calidum et siccum.
I say then that the quality of iron or gold makes a liquid beyond nature hot and dry.I therefore mean that talk of the quality of cautery instruments and their harms is elaborate, subtle, and a hidden secret knowledge.Et non oportet ut loquamur de singulis partibus eius, sed sufficit si de qualitatibus generatim loquimur.
And it is not necessary to speak of its individual parts but sufficient if we speak generally of their qualities.Moreover a multitude of wise men have spoken about it and disagreed on it: and for my part I am satisfied with little from their discourses fearing prolixity.Et qualitas cauterii ferri, et auri in uisum est multo praestantior, sed periculum eius est multo maius: et quod facit in corporibus, multum est praeter naturam.
And the quality of cautery instruments of iron and gold are much more excellent but their dangers are much greater: and that which they do to bodies is much beyond nature.I say therefore that cautery suits universally to every complexion whether with matter or without: excepting two complexions, namely a hot complexion without matter and a dry complexion without matter.Et multum conuenit cauterium in morbis frigidis, et umidis: nam caliditas eius, facit uentilarem per se fluxum, et sicca natura eius, contrahendo humores corporis, ad seuam naturam conuertit.
The complexions however are at variance with the hot and dry matter.
Some indeed have said that cautery is beneficial for it.
And others have said the contrary of this, namely that cautery is not appropriate for a disease which is from heat and dryness; for the nature of fire is heat, and it is inappropriate that a disease should be cured by that which is hot and dry, when that disease itself is hot and dry.
And he who says the contrary of this says that cautery is beneficial for any hot and dry disease which occurs in the bodies of men; for when you compare the body of man, and its moistures, to the complexions of fire, you will find the body of man to be cold.
And indeed I myself say this from my own experience; for indeed I have already several times found it to be so.
However, it is not appropriate for one to come upon this unless he has already been tested and exercised in the last chapter on cautery, and has known the diversity of men's complexions, and the disposition of diseases in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their time-span.Et scit quae sint aegritudes, et qui sunt homines calidi, et sicci, ut possit consilio et experientia sua, si quid in eo sit, facere cauterium: et quod non oportet fieri cauterium, nisi cum materia dissesserit cum ea.
You need not fear about the rest, however; and especially in cold and moist diseases. For indeed all physicians have already agreed upon them; and they did not disagree upon using cautery with them.And in the other diseases there is no dissension amongst them about cautery.
And know, O sons, that the secret of cure by cautery with fire and its goodness is above cautery with medicine burning; for fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member which is being cauterized: and it does no harm to any other member joined to it, except a little harm.Et non teneat mens uestra de iuuamento per Cauterium in omni aegritudine, quae est calida et sicca: sed quandoque necessitas cogit auide faciatis illum.
The action of burning medicine extends to that which is elongated from the limbs; and perhaps it causes disease in the limb difficult to heal, and perhaps it kills.
But fire because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance does not do this unless it is superfluous.
But now we have understood this by experiment, because of the length of service and study with art, and standing over the truth of things; and therefore I excuse myself from the length of speech.
And know ye sons, that they disagree in time, when it is convenient to make a cautery, and put the best time true.
And I say that cautery is convenient in all times; because the harm which happens because of the time sinks into the oath, which is drawn with cautery.
And especially if cautery is because of pains from necessary pains, strong, urgent, which will not bear slowness; therefore it is feared that greater wickedness happens to them than little harm intrudes because of time.Et tamen omnes cauteria necessarium faciunt, ut postea in uestra sapientia iudicabitis.
And yet all cauteries make necessary, that you judge later in your wisdom.And it does not fall into your minds o sons, that they do not estimate unless the crowd and stupid physicians; namely that disease which is healed by cautery, there is not always return: and they put that consequence, and that thing is not as they think, because cautery is not unless in place of medicine, which alters complexion, and dries up humidities which are causes why pains happen.
However, cautery exceeds over medicine by the speed of its strength and power of its operation and vehemence of its dominion; and it is possible that disease returns some time according to the complexion of the sick one, and location of his disease and power: and which is prepared in his body from congregation of superfluities in him, and that which reaches him in his acquisition by foods and similar things for those causes unless there is disease in which cautery is administered. Subtle disease of the limb from few superficialities and moistures, as if by cautery of a tooth, because of pain and similar to that, for it is possible that that pain not return in it.
But that happens in a few cases.
Indeed the common speech that cautery is the last medicine is true speech: not to what they intend in it: for they believe that there is no cure which will accomplish with medicine, nor with anything after the passing of cautery.
But the matter is the contrary of that, and the intent, that cautery is the last medicine, is not, unless when we administer methods of cure in some diseases, and they do not accomplish those medicines: then at the end of the matter we administer cautery, and it accomplishes; then from there falls that cautery is the last medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and multitudes of ignorant doctors understand.
And the ancients have said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say that except because of the equality of gold, and the lightness of its substance; and they said that it does not make pus at the site of cautery. But that is not that absolutely; for I have already proved that, and found it to be so, that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
And cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they have said.
But when you ignite cautery with gold from fire, it is not declared to you when the fire burns according to the quantity that you desire, because of the redness of gold; and if you add upon it ignition, it melts in fire, and turns into sheets.
Wherefore the artisan falls from that in his occupation; and because of that cautery is done with iron among us more quickly and nearer, from rectitude to action.
And indeed I have already arranged this chapter in cautery, according to chapters; and I have arranged them from head to feet, so that the seeker of what he desires may find it from there. The method of cauterizing the head at the crown.
(On the second head.)
This cauterization has reference to the mastery of moisture and coldness in the brain; for these two are the causes of the flow of humors from the head into the parts of the eyes and ears, and of sleepiness, and pain of teeth, and pain in the throat; and universally of all sicknesses that come from coldness, as paralysis, and gout, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar sicknesses.
The manner of cauterization is that you give the invalid first medicine of purification to be taken in drink for three or four nights, according to what the strength of the patient and his age and custom demand.
Then bid him make radiant his head with a new razor.Et postea faciatur super caput infimi cauterium secundum modum supradictum, et adhaererit super caput uncia una aurata ad horam.
Then make him sit between your hands so that he places his own hands on his chest.
Then place the palm of your hand over the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever therefore your middle finger comes to rest, mark that spot with a piece of charcoal. Then light the cautery-lantern: this is its shape. Then place it over the spot marked with charcoal and slowly tighten your hand around it as you twist it.
Then release your hand quickly and look at the spot.
If you see that a quantity equal to the head of an al-nail, or the quantity of a zaybar, has been removed from the bone, then release your hand.
And if not, repeat with the iron itself, or with another one if the first becomes cold: until you see the bones that I told you about.
Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, moisten the bandage with it and apply it to the wound: leave it on for three days.Et post tres dies uidebo te.
Then place over it a bandage moistened with butter and leave it until the burn is healed.And after three days I will see you again. Then treat it with the four-drug ointment until it heals.
They say that a wound which is left open drains and pus comes out; therefore it is better for the patient.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized all the way down to the bone and the cautery held until something of the thickness of a bone is burnt away.Et qui faciunt haec: uenena et unguenta praeferunt.
Then when that which has been burnt from the bone has been scraped off and healed over.And those who do this use poisons and ointments.
And others say that it is necessary to cauterize right down to the bone until an impression of the tip of the iron is made on it and some of the bone falls away so that it becomes like a scar; or with the instrument which women use when infusing a little alfafes, and they think that the vapours of the head are breathed out through this place and the wound remains open for a long time.Et qui faciunt haec: non debent curare uulnus.
Then it is treated until it has healed.
But I do not see these two species of cautery at all except in some people according to the way of fear.
And it is better for me to dismiss him, with his own health.
For the head is weakened from the dissolution of its natural continuity: as we have witnessed in other limbs: and especially when the sick person's head is weak by nature: and indeed the first kind of cautery is more safe and better with me, and I use it: operate therefore with it in health.
¶ Of the manner of cauterizing the head in a headache throughout the head.
Head III.De cauteria aurea: et de ambustione capitis cauterio: et quomodo debet esse cauterizatio.
When a chronic headache occurs throughout the head and that continues with the patient and he uses hellebore, and cocklebur, and head-purges, and oils, and fomentation:
And especially if he has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we related, and it does not bring him any relief from them: then consider.Et postea quaerendo invenerit te medicum, qui tibi faciat cauterium aurum.
If the head of the patient is of a strong nature and not feeble, and it feels the cold keenly; then cauterize with another cautery under that one a little way.
Then he should cauterize it all around the head with the cautery, not piercing through the skin, and the bone should be exposed to the extent that we described.
And he should cauterize the back of his head with one cautery, where the hair is divided, and it is the place where the windpipe is; and raise your cautery to this, and do not expose the bone.
For the patient will find that because of it he suffers great pain, and different from the pain caused by all the other cauteries on his head.
And I will describe this cautery in its place; and it should be a cautery with which the sides of the head are cauterized, and also under it more subtly with a cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
And this is its shape.
On the method of cauterization in hemicrania, using both burning medicine and iron.
Chapter 4.
When a person has pain in the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and is evacuated with cleansing medicines, and the remaining treatment that I mentioned under the divisions of diseases, and it does not make him well; then cauterization in that place is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning sharp medicine, or with iron. But cautery with a burning sharp medicine is as follows: take a tooth of another person and scrape it, and cut away its tips on both sides.Et teneas in mano tua, et accendis cum ligno, et sublimes super caput uel per omnia cornua capitis, et facies per omnes partes quae debent ad caput, per oculum, per nasum, per uersum, et inter oculos, ubi scirros esse solet, et per auriculam.
Then split open the spot of pain with a broad phlebotomy instrument at the moment when it is being done until there is a hole under the skin where the tooth is lodged.
Then push it into the hole under the skin until it is hidden; then tie a thread around it with a suitable constrictive knot, and leave it for fifteen hours; then untie it, and extract another one, and leave the wound for two or three days; then place a poultice saturated in butter on top of it until pus forms; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish to do this with some burning medicines which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
However, the cautery of it with iron is as follows:
Fire Cautery, whose shape is this:
And it is called Claw; because the shape of its head is like that of a claw, and there is some hollow space in it, and in the middle of it there is some small protuberance.
Then place it on top of the spot, and hold your hand steady; and you revolve the iron slowly with speed; and let the amount that is cauterized be according to the thickness of the skin, just as its depth.
And lift up your hand so that the artery below is not cauterized and there is no blood flow.
Then moisten the poultice with salt water and place it on top of the spot for three days; then put a poultice with butter on top of that: afterwards treat the wound with ointment until it is healed. And if you wish, cauterize this half-skull with the second tip of the cautery knife.
And beware cutting the artery in this half-skull, not the old one specifically.Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.
Then split open the spot of pain with a broad phlebotomy instrument at the moment when it is being done until there is a hole under the skin where the tooth is lodged.
Chapter 5
When you are treating a headache, along with what we said in the previous cure, and what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and the cure does not help: and you see from the illness that it is not sufficient for him what we said from the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, then you should use the knife cautery until it turns white after you sign over the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost that: and put down your hand once, and tighten it until you cut the artery, and penetrate to the bone. However, you must be careful about the continuation of the jaw, which moves at chewing, so that it does not burn the side or nerve that moves it, so that a spasm does not occur.
And be over the guard, and caution about the flow of blood from the artery, which was cut.
For there is fear in cutting it off, and especially for one who does not know what he is doing, and is neither eager nor experienced: and dismisses the operation with that first.
And I will come with the remembrance of the regimen for the flow of blood from an artery according to its way, and in its place in this book.
But if you see from the illness that it is not sufficient for him this cautery, and you see the sick body bearing the cautery in the middle of his head, as we related, cure the wound until it heals.Et si post hoc diem, vel bi, uel tri, aut quadam parte, non melli, sed peperit sanguinem, vel sero purulento, utpote quod diuersitas deoicione, et non uitio, et aduertantur medicos:
And if you wish, apply the cautery which we spoke of in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery that has two blades.
For this cautery is better and more effective. On the way of cauterizing for earache.
CHAPTER VI. When a pain in the ear occurs from cold and is treated with ointments and other remedies as we said above in the discussion, and yet the pain does not go away, then apply fire cautery. The instrument for this is called the puncturing-tool, and its form is as follows:
Then with it puncture all around the entire ear, just as was described; or on both ears if the pain is in both at once.Pro procedendo ad cauterizandum conuenit primum punctiones facere per lineas solitas: deinde cum igne cauterizare eandem punctionem singulas, sicut est necesse: post haec cauteria sublimes faciuntur circa puncta ad modum crucis.
For proceeding to cauterization it is fitting first to make the punctures along the usual lines; then with fire cauterize each puncture, one by one, as necessity demands. Afterwards fine cauteries are made around the punctures in the shape of a cross. And when you have extended the cautery a little way from the root of the ear after having marked the places with encaustic: and let there be ten cauteries, or almost that number, in each ear.
Then heal the places until they are cured.
On the way of cauterizing for torture.Caput VII.
Chapter VII.
Ch. VII. The torture that is treated by cautery is only from the species which occur from phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of diseases. And a tortuous cautery is due to the species that occurs from drying out and nerve spasm.
When you heal this species of torture with hyssop and head-purges, and gargarisms, and your treatment does not work, then it is fitting that you cauterize the invalid in three places: one at the root of the ear, and a second, a little lower from its joint, and a third at the conjunction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite part of the invalid.Et si non conferat etiam tunc, oportet ut confirmet cauterizationem suam ad partes, quae sunt ad modum crucis, a timpanismo in medio.
And if it still does not work, it is fitting that he confirm his cautery on the parts which are in the form of a cross, with the timpanism in the middle. Because softening does not occur except in the part which appears healthy.Et si in illo quoque loco non mollificatur, oportet ut cauterizes partes suas ad modum crucis cum unguento Galeni super faciem, ubi est tortura et timpanismus.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize with a cautery-iron, its tip slightly bent upwards at the extreme edge of the upper ear, below the side of the head: and another time, whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
And lay your hand with the cautery-iron, until half the thickness of the skin is burned away.
And this is the form of the cautery-iron, and it is made from a knife whose shape precedes that which has been described; however, it should not be too thin, but rather slightly thicker. Then treat the places with what precedes, until they heal.
On the manner of cauterizing for old apoplexy.Et si in Apoplexia antica, qua cum praesens vita sit periculosa: et non possit aliter mederi nisi cauterizare: uti debuerit in his locis.
Chapter 8.Et forma Cauterizationis est: ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis Auris superioris, sub Cornu Capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius Longitudo sit secundum longitudinem Pollicis.
And the form of cauterization is, to cauterize with a cautery-iron, its tip slightly bent upwards at the extreme edge of the upper ear, below the side of the head: and another time, whose length is according to the length of the thumb.And if there be old apoplexy, and you treat it as we have said, and your treatment avails not, and the sick man has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries over every horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of his head, as we have said before, and with a cautery on the back of his head, according to what has been said; and the size of the cautery-iron must be according to what has been described.
He is also cauterized with a cautery-iron over his throat, and this is more dangerous.
Then let him be treated as we have said.Et si non confert: et non potest aliter curari nisi per venam: uti debet in his locis.
On the manner of cauterizing for apoplexy.Et si obliuio sit, et non possit aliter curari nisi cauterizare: et non habet febrem, et non potest aliter curari nisi per venam: uti debet in his locis.
Chapter IX.
First of all in a drink there should be given the leaves of the great nettle and the cleansing brain pills.
Then shave the whole head of the patient and put on his forehead the plaster described in the book of plasters; and put it on him often. For that is the cautery itself; and make it according to the same order which I mentioned there. If therefore he is healed by this, it is good.In caeto scilicet et in ulcere bene: sed si non, fac illum faciendum secundum rationem, quam dixi.
If the patient is not healed in the wound and the scabs, then have him made according to the rule I have given. If not, make three cauteries for him on the back of his head, which descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and put between each cautery the thickness of a finger.
Then treat the cauteries with what precedes them.Et postea fac illum secundum rationem, quam dixi.
And afterwards have him made according to the rule which I have given. If you see a need for it, and the patient can tolerate it, then make a cautery on him in the middle.Et postea fac omnia, sicut praecessit.
If you wish an addition: then cauterize it over the two horns.
Then treat it until it is healed: and let the cautery be of olive oil according to the form which was prescribed.
Of the manner of cauterizing in Paralysis and softening.
CHAPTER X.
Thou shalt proceed in the purification of the head with hyssop, and with that which we have said.Et post ea facies unctionem super caput cum oleo oliverum cum artemisio et galbano: et super loca dolorosa facies unctiones cum oleo oliverum cum thysino et myrrha:
And afterwards thou shalt make an ointment upon the head with olive oil with wormwood and galbanum: and upon painful places thou shalt make ointments with olive oil with thyme and myrrh:Then shave the head of the sick man; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over every horn of the head, and with a cautery over the hinder part of it, and with three over the bones of the neck.Et cum his facies unctiones secundum artem medicam: et postea facias super caput infirmorum stome cum lino.
If indeed you are in need of softening the body with many of those, and the patient is weak and the disease strong: then cauterize it with four cauteries above the vertebrae of the back, and with the last cautery until much of its skin is burnt, and raise your hand.
Then treat him until he is healed, and so with the Olive cautery.
¶ Of the manner of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Chapter 11.De cauterio in capite percutiendo.
A person with epilepsy is not cauterized unless the cause of his epilepsy is phlegmatic.Et si in capite aut alibi ex sanguine combuerit, non cauterizatur, donec sanguis stetit: et postea de novo cauterizatur. And if it is burnt in the head or elsewhere from bloodletting, it is not cauterized until the blood has settled; and afterwards he is cauterized again.Therefore you should cleanse his brain first with a sponge and with the rest of the treatment which we mentioned above in the diagnosis: when the disease is strong, or he is tolerating the acceptance of medicines.In capite autem de novo non indiges ut mundifices, sed cum hyeris: et si sanguis est magnus, oportet ut eleuas, postea mundifices, et de novo cauterizes.
However, you do not need to cleanse the head again, but with a sponge: and if there is much blood, you must raise it, then cleanse it, and cauterize it again.But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then a gargle is administered, and purifying mastication of the brain, before that for many days with a softening of foods.Deinde post masticationem administratur gargarisma mundificans cerebrum, et faciuntur mastigationes super caput.
Then after the mastication a gargle is administered to cleanse the brain, and mastications are done over the head.Then scrape his head, then cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner: and with another cautery at the back of his head, and over every horn of his head.Et si faciuntur super caput mastigationes pro cauterio, et sanguis exuitur multum de capite eius, non debet aliter cauterizari: sed cum sanguine coagulato in capite, et cum hyeris, et cum oleo.
And if mastications are done over the head for cautery, and blood is driven out much from his head, he must not be cauterized otherwise: but with coagulated blood in his head, and with sponge, and with oil.If he has been strong and tolerating, then cauterize him with cauteries which I said in a person having paralysis, and softening of the body above the vertebrae of the neck, and the vertebrae of the back: and let it be an Olive cautery according to the manner that preceded.Et postea facias masticationem cum oleo et cum hyeris super caput eius, et postea de novo mundifices caput: et si sanguis multum stetit in capite, non debet aliter cauterizari, nisi cum sanguine coagulato, et cum oleo. If however the child is feeble, then apply a fine cautery in this manner.
Of the manner of cauterizing in melancholy.
Chapter 12.
When the cause of melancholy is corrupt humours, and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries which we said are to be used by one having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is superabundance of yellow humour tending to melancholy, and the body of the patient is moistened, then give him to drink that which purifies his brain, according as has been said in the division; then shave the head of the sick person, and afterwards make a bandage fitly made out of flax, in the form of a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head; and let the sick person sitting upright be held on all sides.Et si non habet vna tortellam, sed duas, una intra aliam, et caput inter ambias, et deinde faciunt lumen cum lumine: et si teneatur bene per tres dies et noctes, meliorem factum fiet infirmus, si non moriatur sub tempo.
Then present the ointment.And if he has not one bandage but two, one within another, and the head between both; and they make a light with another light: and if he is held well for three days and nights, the sick person will be better, if he does not die in the meantime. And it is more worthy from old butter of sheep.Antiquus enim butyrus non nocebit, sed proficiet: novus autem maleficus est et noxelet.
And heat the tool over a fire until it reaches a moderate temperature that can be tolerated by the finger when it is inserted.
Then pour vinegar into its middle in a circle and leave it until it cools down.
Do this once a week for the weak patient, while maintaining his other good regimen, until he recovers.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small holes in it, except for the part that you are holding with the cautery iron; rather let it be by smelling it.
For this kind of cautery affects the brain with its quality.
Then put over it a bandage soaked in butter or chicken fat.
¶ On the method of cauterization with descending water towards the eye.
Chapter 13.
When you are told the beginning of the water in the eye by the signs which I have described in the division, then begin and give the weak patient a drink with that which purifies his head.
And guard him against all moistness, and let him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.Et pota ipsum de vino rutilo calido.
Then order him to wash his head, and cauterize the middle of his head.Et fac eum potare de vino rubesco calido, et fac illum dormire intra verna, ad ubi sit latus ad ventum frigidum: et munda caput eius, et radat eum in balneo. Then cauterize both ears with two cauteries, if there is a discharge of water from both eyes at the same time; or from one side, if there is a discharge of water from one eye only; and with the cautery cut all the veins and arteries that are under the skin; and let the cauteries be long in width equal to the ears; and beware of bleeding.
If you see anything coming out of it, then cut it off at once with any medicine that is possible; and I will come with wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries, and cutting them off, and guarding against bleeding.
And when it is cauterized in the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries ultimately projected.
¶ On the way of cauterizing in ancient tears.
Chapter 14.
When the tears of the eyes are old, and there is something on the veins and arteries that are in the outward head, it is verified that this is from the superfluities of cold, phlegmatic: then cauterize with the same cautery as I narrated in the inception of water descending, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over the two ears, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
And if you need addition, then cauterize it on every side of the eye, over the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere oculi caute, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.
¶ On the way of cauterizing in the fetor of the nose.Et postea si indiges addere, tunc cauteriza ipsum per omnes partes nasi, et facies cauteria in latitudine nasi: quae sint inter nasum et oculum.
Chapter 15.
When you treat this with what we have said in the previous chapter, and the treatment is ineffective: then give three nights of infusory drinks, afterwards shave the head and cauterize it with a medium cautery, using an olive oil cautery.
Then cauterize it with a nail cautery with two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair, very little.
And beware of an artery, lest you cut it.
And this is the form of a nail cautery.
¶ On the way of cauterizing for the softening of the eyelid.
Chapter 16.
When an eyelid is softened by a disease or humidity: then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, using this lunar cautery.Et si postea molle manet: tunc teriaca de osse bovi, et teriaca de sanguine ovi, cum vini rubri, et teriaca de gallina viva, et teriaca de melle, cum teriaca eorum quae diximus: omnia haec in uno potu da.
And if you wish, cauterize it just above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in every part: and they will be drawn from the two temples: and let the length of all the cauteries be according to the lengths of the eyebrow: and do not finish your hand with the cautery, rather according to the quantity that is being burnt, the third eyelid.
And this is the form of the cautery according to this mode of lunar cautery.
¶ Of the way of cauterizing the Eyelid when the hairs turn and sting the eye. Chapter XVII.De cauterizzazione palpebrale.
Cautery on it is according to two ways: either cautery with fire or cautery with burning medicine.De cauterizzazione palpebre super barbas irrumantes oculum.
But in cautery with fire, command the weak before it that he should trim his hairs if he is of those who clean them, until they are prolonged and equalized.Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae. But if they sting him at their source, then constrict his eyelids with a thread, so that they do not move until they are born.Et si uis, capite pilum supra ortum eorum: et pon in oculum eius olerem aquilarum, qui tangat barbas irrumantes oculum: et trahe eum per omnes partes oculi donec nascatur: et si non potest nascere per totam partem, trahe per aliquam, et dimitte restem.
When they are born and made equal, then place the patient's head in your lap; subsequently mark on the eyelid of his eye with cautery, a mark that it is according to the shape of a bay leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the eyelashes.
Then place a bandage soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucus over the eye.
Then apply the cautery with this form:
Then cauterize over the figure that you marked little by little with many passes until you burn away all of the skin surface, which is shaped just as a bay leaf appears to be, entirely on its own.
And the sign of your work's success is that if you see the eyelid of the eye now contracting, and the eyelashes receding away from the spot on the eye.
Then lift up your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Then place over him a bandage with butter, until the scab is removed.Cauteria tamen debet esse facienda cum lachryma oculi: et si in uisu cauteria non posset fieri: ponatur cotum super oculum.
However, the cauterization must be done with tears from the eye; and if in the vision cauterization cannot be done, then place a bandage over the eye. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
If anything of the eyelashes returns after an hour, and the eyelid softens, then repeat cauterization over that spot just as you did at first.Quod si post diem pilus uel palpebra non redeant: et oculum permanere stet: tunc cotum de oculu eleua: et uti oculo sicut ante operatum fuit.
If however there are hairs in the lower lid: then cauterize it until it is released to its natural place: and trim them so that they do not prick the eye.
On the method of cauterization with a burning medicine in this case.
CHAPTER 18.
It is as if you were to tell the sick man to stop scratching until the itch subsides and the skin is soothed.
Make a pad from a piece of cloth in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take a known quantity, about an ounce, of soap not impregnated with lime, and a like quantity of quicklime; then rub them together with a good rubbing-action, making it into a paste as if you were making blacking, so that it does not freeze stiff.
Then spread some of the mixture on the pad you have made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid of one or both eyes.Incipies enim post ea cauterizare cum medicina comburente: et non debes exagere, ne oculum lueras.
You will then begin to cauterize with a burning medicine; and you must not overdo it lest you burn the eye.And place a wet cloth on the eye, and have the sick man’s head in your lap.Postea cum ea medicina comburente, fac ut durabit post 24 horas: et intra 15 dies debet bene curari.
And place your index finger over the medicine, and press it a little.
And you move it as often as the patient feels the bite of the medicine, because he finds its bite like fire.
Therefore when this has persisted at what he himself found by the biting, then leave off the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When therefore the bite ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And then consider if you see the eyelid to swell as it swells from a burn with fire or from an incision, it is well: and if not, then repeat over it from the medicine on the place where it does not press and does not blacken, until your work becomes equal and the eye contracts.
Then put on the eye a cotton with butter, until the burnt skin is eradicated.Postea si uides oculum contusum, et non eleuatur palpebra, tu itera cotum cum butyro super locum ustionatis, donec eleuat palpebra: et si non, tunc ponito super eam medicinam adustionis, donec eradicetur ustio.
Then if you see the eye contused and not swollen, you repeat the cotton with butter on the place of the burn until it swells: and if not, then put on it medicine for burning, until the burn is eradicated.Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment or another until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you in making the operation to guard the last guard, so that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye.Et si uides oculos quoslibet inflatos esse cum aqua, et non potest evacuare, ut sit per omnia mensura, et non debes mutare locum medicinae, sed necesse est, ut itere super ipsam, donec evacuabitur water.
And if you see the eyes swollen with water and not able to evacuate, as long as it is by all measure, and you must not change the place of the medicine, but it is necessary that you repeat on it, until it evacuates water.If the eyelid becomes soft after days, and fights something from the eyelash in the eye, then repeat the medicine over that place which softens from the eyelid itself, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of bay leaf.
And you should know that men's eyes differ in size and smallness.Et scias, quomodo oculus debet esse ad uisionem: primum debet esse planus, et uisibilis omnino per omnes partes, intra seque et extra, donec possit bene uere speculum oculi, ut sit quasi uetra, in qua resplendescat imago ad uisionem: sed si est contusa vel scabra palpebra, non potest esse planum oculum neque uisibilis.
Therefore let your consideration be according to that, and do not conceal the way of rectitude from him who has a passion for this art.
Of the manner of cauterizing a tear-duct fistula.
Chapter 19.
When you are treating a fistula, and your treatment is not helping as we said concerning the divisions of diseases, then you ought to cauterize it in the following manner.
Have the patient lay his head in your lap and have an assistant hold his head between his hands so that it does not move or toss about.Exigis in manibus tuo lachrymalem poriuncum: et si non exigis, teneas manibus tuo taliter, ut non cadat lacrima per os narium:
Then hold the tear-duct with your fingers so that the tears do not run into his nose; then place a piece of cotton soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage over his eye; then apply the cautery, which has this shape.Figura Cauterii pro Fistula lachrymali.
Cautery for a tear-duct fistula.Let the cautery be hollow like a reed pen from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to go upwards thus far.Figura cauterii pro Fistula lachrymali.
However this hollow shape is better for your purpose.
Then put over it a cautery which is made very hot.
And hold with it your hand a little by the cautery from the eye, to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not wander or become unsteady, and you put the cautery into the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If therefore you reach with your cautery at first to the bone, it will be well.
And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it: and leave that for three days.Et post tres dies, ponas alium Cauterium super eum, quod fit ignitum valde.
Then put a bandage with butter on it and treat it with an astringent ointment until it is healed. If forty days have passed and it is not healed, then put on it an acute corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what came in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some authorities have mentioned first.
Attend to the location of the fistula and find it; then put into its fissure a very thin cannula, that is, a very thin tube, the shape of which is as follows.
And pour into it the quantity of a drachma from liquified lead, and hold your hand steady with a good grip on the cannula so that the patient does not move at all, lest the hot lead run into his eye.
And you ought to put over the patient's eye a bandage soaked in white of egg or water.
For the lead will burn up the place of the fistula and heal it in a marvelous way.
If the fistula is healed with this cautery and treatment, that is good.Et postea cura locum cum unguento exiccatiuo usque ad curam: et si in oculis sint tacia, qui ex fistula facta sunt, fac de oleo et terga, et pone super tacia, donec sanat.
And afterwards treat the place with an astringent ointment until it is healed; and if there are scars on the eyes that were made by the fistula, make a mixture of oil and tar and put it over the scars, until they are healed.And if not, then there is need to open up the nostril and lead the fistula back into its natural course according to what will be said in its own place.
¶ Of a way of cauterizing lip fissures.Cauteria autem, et medicina, qua cum ea fiunt, facit se in hanc modum.
Ch. 20.De caute rizatione in labiis.
Fissures often occur in the lips, and especially in children's lips; they are called hairs.Quas cum intraverit materia, et non possit exire per foramen nari, quia fuit interpositum corium durum, sed superius intrinsecusque tenuitur, et per totam labiorum partem est resectum et praecisum.
When therefore you are treating these fissures and the treatment does not help as we said in the classification of diseases, then you should apply a little knife cautery with fire in this way.
And its concavity is according to the thinness of the knife.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ On the way of cauterizing in mouth abscesses.
CHAPTER 21.De cauterizzazione in narice.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gums, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then it forms pus and bursts; afterwards it becomes hardened, and the pus runs out, and a fistula is formed; then one treats it, and the treatment does not take effect; then one must apply cauterization with fire according to the amount that it can bear in the fistula.
Then insert the hot iron into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand there until the hot iron penetrates to the depth of it, and its end; do this once or twice.
Then treat it afterwards with what we have said about treatment until it is cured.
If therefore the pus is discharged and it heals, it will be good.Si tamen non curatur post illud, cum eo quod diximus, debuerit iterari ignitia cauterium in ea sicut diximus usquequo curetur: et quod diximus tibi, sic fac et obserua.
But if it is not healed after that, with what we have said, then the cauterization by fire must be repeated on it as we have said until it is cured: and what I have told you, do it and keep to it. And if not, then it is necessary to open the place and take away the rotten bone according to what comes in its head.
On the method of cauterization on gums, and soft teeth.
Chapter 22.De gingiui scorte, quae non curatur cum aqua calida, neque cum unguento.
When the gums are soft because of moistness and the teeth are shaken, and you treat it with remedies and it does not take effect; then place the head of the patient on your lap.Deinde fac ignia de ferris minutis et calidis: et intromitte eam in foramine radicum dentum quae mouentur, et tene manum tuam super eam donec perueniat ad profundum eius: si quando senserit dolorem, trahe manum tuam, et posuere post paucos momentos.
Then make a fire from small and hot iron pieces; and insert it into the opening of the roots of the teeth which are shaken, and hold your hand over it until it reaches to its depth: if he feels any pain, withdraw your hand and put it back after a few moments. Then cauterize with the fire, the shape of which will come later, in such a way as to place a tube over the tooth; and quickly insert the hot cautery into it, and hold your hand there for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached to the root of the tooth.Et postea intromittes in eam olium calidum: et facit pus: deinde curas eam cum aqua calida, et oλιο calido: si tamen non curatur, post illud intromittes in eam olium frigidum: quod tibi placet.
And then raise your hand: and repeat the cautery a number of times as you see fit.
Then let him fill his hollow tooth with salt water, and hold it for an hour; and then spit it out.
For the movement of the tooth is made firm, and the soft gums are tightened, and the foul moisture dried up.
Chapter 23.
When the pain of a tooth is due to coldness, or there is coldness or heat in it, and treatment with remedies does not avail; then cautery is used in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
But the cautery with butter is done by taking vacca's butter and melting it in an iron spoon or ladle.
Then take a cotton pad and wrap it around the tip of a probing instrument.
Then dip this in the melted butter and quickly place it on the painful tooth, and hold it until it cools; then repeat this several times until the fire's power penetrates to the root of the tooth.
And if you like, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth; and then put hot iron on top of this until the fire penetrates to the depth of the hollow tooth.
But cautery with fire is done by using an air pipe or an iron pipe.Deinde ponas ferrum super focum, donec ignis ueniat per cannulam: et submerge cotum in oleo uaccino, et ponas ipsum intra cannulam: tene ante dentem dolorosum. Then place the iron on a fire until the fire comes through the pipe; and dip cotton in vakka's oil and put it inside the pipe: hold this against the painful tooth. And let there be something of thickness in his body so that the fire's sharpness does not penetrate to the bone.
Then heat the cautery iron until it is hot; and place it on the tooth: and hold your hand thus until the cautery cools.
Do this several times, for the pain will go away either at that time or on another day.Deinde eleua manum tuam: deinde itera cauterium aliquotiens secundum quod uis.
And one must fill the weak bone with good butter during cauterization and hold it there for an hour; then spit it out.
This is the form of cauterization.
You can cauterize with any tip as much as possible, and this is the form of the cannula.
Of the method of cauterization for staph infection.
Chapter XXIV.
When staph infections are from phlegm, and from cold moisture, and are not obedient to digestion through medicine, and you see their digestion quickly: then cauterize with a hollow cautery, whose form is as follows.
Having two open ends, so that the smoke exits from one end of the cautery, and place it lit upon the boil once or twice if you need to until it penetrates the depth of the boil.
If the boil is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the boil.Et si strophula est in corpore humano, et non potest esse extrahitum, sed debet permanere cum corpori: tunc fac Cauterium de ligno, ut sit prope istam strophulam, et tenes in manibus tuo donec ignis consumat apostema uel totum, et si possit extrahi.
Then leave it for three days, and place on top of it a poultice infused in butter, until what was burnt by fire is removed.
Then treat it with toothpaste until the socket heals.
¶ How to cauterize a hoarse voice and a tight throat.
CHAPTER 25.De modo curandi lues puluisque, et ulcera quae ex iis procedunt.
How to treat syphilis and the sores that result from it.When moist humors settle on top of the lung canal, and especially when they are accompanied by cold complexions, then first the patient must be purged with mild remedies.Et si uenerit sicut per accidens ex raucedine, et constrictione anhelitu, et non possit bene respire, sed mandeat cum uentilabili labore magno, quod uigintio quaeque hora faciatur cauterium super petra ad sinistram laterem bracchie, et ante quaestum sicco linteo expiatum, et postea infuso oleo et terga petrae, et in medio super uentilabilem labore ponatur terra sigillata et terra nitrosa in qua mox caustica super terram sigillatam et terrae nitrosae admixtae sint, et super illam terra sigillata alibi in petra positus sicut pedalis signum, et inter ambas terras linteum siccum ponatur, et super illum terra nitrosa infusa oleo et super eandem terra sigillata.
And if it comes as an accident from hoarseness and tightness of breathing, and he cannot breathe well, but breathes with great effort, then every two hours for twenty-four hours a cauterization should be performed on the stone to the left of the arm, and before being cauterized, a dry linen cloth must be wiped over it, and after that infused oil and the back of the stone, and in the middle above the breathing effort there must be placed seal earth and nitrous earth, with which a mixture of quicklime has been added to the sigillated earth, and on top of the sigillated earth elsewhere on the stone a sign like the sign of a foot, and between both earths a dry linen cloth is placed, and over that nitrous earth infused in oil, and on top of that sigillated earth.Then cauterize it at the root of the throat in a depressed spot: and beware, lest you touch with the cautery to the throat, nor on the skin, unless something of it.Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.
Then you cauterize it with a different cautery by the joint of the neck at its last vertebra: and let the cautery be like a claw according to the method which has preceded.
Then treat it with what has preceded until it is cured.
On the method of cautery for diseases of the lung and cough.
Chapter 26.
When the cough and disease of the lungs are from cold humours, and the patient is not feverish nor phthisical, nor suffering from a long-standing illness: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the furcula in the depressed places, gently and slowly.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be like a tube according to the shape which has preceded.Et cura loca post cauteria, donec sint uti si non cauterizata fuissent: et da ei potum aquae calidae cum melle ad libitum.
And if the cauterization will be with your cautery by puncturing with it, which is named "Punctum", whose shape precedes the puncturing of the pain of the ears; and let there be punctures from thirty punctures almost to the other.
Then treat it with what preceded it, until it is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Why then is cauterization relieved with it, when you do with it at the same time three cauteries?
On the manner of cauterizing in a tickling, in a dislocation of the shoulder.
Chapter 27.
When the head of the assistant is caused by moisture, and does not return to its place within an hour after the dislocation, until it has become accustomed to return, then dislocate it from a slight movement, which happens just as we have already testified, then you must reduce the dislocation in the first place.
Then the invalid is laid on his back or on his sound side.Et ponatur sub caput saepe una cotyledra, et sub illa alna, et ponantur lateribus pedes in modum de quibus loquebamur, donec dislocatio reducatur ad locum suum, et postea faciant eum ut dormiat supinus.
Then raise up the skin which is on the inside of the titillus with the fingers of your left hand, and if the joint is dislocated to the inside.
Then take a cautery heated in fire with two fingers. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and there will come a figure of cauterization with four cauteries.
And when cauterization is made with a cautery having three fingers, then the figure of cauterization is six cauteries; and the fingers are according to the subtlety of the touch.Deinde quandoque facit figura cauterizationis duodecim cauteriorum: et fit cum cauterio quadridigitali, quare est figura cauterizationis quae habet duo decem uerua.
And then sometimes the figure of cauterization is twelve cauteries; and it is made with a four-fingered cautery, so that there is a figure of cauterization which has twenty fingers. And this is the form of the cautery having three fingers.Et est forma cauterii quadridigitalis.
And sometimes one is added to this mode, so that there are eight cauteries.Et si fit cauterizatio cum cauterio sextidigitali, et forma cauterizationis est viginti et quattuor uerua: et est quaedam ex parte latus, et quaedam ex parte titillici, et quaedam per medium, et quaedam extra.
And when cauterization is made with a six-fingered cautery, and the form of cauterization is twenty-four fingers; and there are some from the side, and some from the titillus, and some through the middle, and some outside. Then put over the cautery crushed onions with salt.
Then make the invalid remain quiet, so that the limb is not moved for a certain time until he is healed.Et post aliquando movet titillicum, et poscit eum pedem facere adhaerens ad terram.
And after a while let him move the titillus, and bid him put his foot against the ground; and if the dislocation is to the upper part, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it on the shoulder with a nail-like cautery or by pricking many cauteries.
For the joint is made firm and the moisture is removed; and the invalid is healed.Deinde adhaererat pedem ad terram usque cum confortetur, et factum est titillicum ut in modo primo.
Then he remained with his foot against the ground until he was healed, and the titillus became as it was before.¶ The manner of cauterizing the Stomach.
Chapter 28.De mode cauterizando Intestina.
When there is cold and great moisture in the stomach until it is extracted from his complexion, and the cataracts multiply to him, and the modes of curing frequently, and does not bring about: then it is necessary that the infirm person be laid on his back, and extend his legs, and his hands.
Then he is cauterized with three cauteries, a cautery under the chest the size of a thimble with a cautery of a clove, and two cauteries below from the two sides of a cautery one, until the figure of the cauteries comes triangularly.
And lengthen between both so that they are not joined when they make pus.Et si uellet extirpare, faciatur cum lance sublanata, ne lympha ad medullam demanet. And if he wants to pull out, it is done with a blade under the skin so that the lymph does not run to the marrow.And the depth of the cautery is the quantity of two thirds of the thickness of the skin.Et si non elonga inter utraque, et fiet pus, faciatur lancia, et postea cauterium, donec exsanguinet pus, et extirpetur omne.
Let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form, without addition; and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the instrument with which this cauterization is done be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by pricking with that which terrifies it from this cautery; and there is, as signs over the stomach, puncturing according to the amount which you wish with the caustic: then cauterize it with the cautery of the point; then cure it with the cure, which preceded, until it heals.
¶ Of the manner of cauterizing a cold Ulcer.
Chapter 29.
When there happens in the liver pain from cold and moisture, or from thick wind, until it leaves its natural condition by superfluous egression, and is cured feebly with that which we said, and does not profit therein: then it behoves that the sick person be laid down on his back, and cauterized with caustic three cauteries according to this figure, and this same quantity over the liver below from under the ribs, where the elbow of man reaches; and let there be space which is between every cautery according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of the body straight: and do not press your hand much with the cautery.
And let the quantity of that which is burnt be from the thickness of the skin, the quantity of its half not added; and let the sick person stand on his feet.Et sit figura cauterium secundum hanc formam quae demonstramus: et non addas ad eam multum, ne percutiat omnes viscera intra se, sed ad infimos: et sit qualitas caloris superius et infimus ad summum: et sit ad medium interium temperatum.
If he is not standing then he should be lying down with his legs extended and his arms raised up. This is the shape of the cautery.
And indeed it is possible for you to cauterize with these cauteries using a knife-like cautery when you have skill and judgement in the art.
And be careful not to go too deep in cauterization, lest the thickness of the skin everywhere be burnt up and the whole body be affected, and it penetrate to the intestines; for there the skin is very thin: know this therefore.
On the method of cauterizing ulcerous sores.
CHAPTER 30.
When you have a growth that is about to come out and you want to know whether it is in the liver itself or only on its membrane, if it is in the liver itself, there will be a dull pain and heaviness without acute pain; but if it is on the membrane of the liver, there will be acute, piercing pain; and you will already know that treatment by the doctors has been ineffective.
Then the patient must recline with his head back.Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.
Then draw the outline of the ulcer with a hot iron; then heat the cautery to the required heat.Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.
And this is its shape.
And you shall cauterize with it one cauterization, until the skin is burnt up entirely and it penetrates as far as the phlegmon, until all the pus comes out; then heal it with treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
And it is not advisable to use this kind of cautery, unless one's interest in the art of medicine prolongs; and whose hands these diseases coincide with experience many times: then indeed he dares over such an operation.
But for me to send her away is better.
¶ On the manner of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Chapter 31.
The antiques said, the cautery with the roots of Aristolochia to the cold pleurisy in this way.Et si frigescit post aliam cauterizationem, et non potest peruenire ad siphac, ut suprascribitur, et scies tibi, quod uirgo est inter costae: ergo incide super eam, et fac cauterium in medio, et exuto illum mox sanguinem.
And it is, to take from the roots of dry Aristolochia long ones, a root that is found in it, and is as thick as a finger.Et facit incisionem in medio uirgine, et intrare cum eo cauterium super eam: sed si frigescit, et non potest peruenire ad siphac, ut suprascribitur, et scies tibi quod uirgo inter costae, ergo incide super eam, and you make the cautery in the middle and take it out of that blood.
Then immerse it in oil: and light it in fire.Et postea quum uirgo tegere coepit, fac incisionem in medio, et exuto sanguinem, et accendat cauterium in medio ipso: et facit eam cauterizare usque ad os: nam non debet uirgo esse sub cuti, sed supra cutim.
Then cauterize with one cautery between the fork and the neck, and two small cauteries on a slight incline below the beard.
And two more cauteries on the incline between the fifth and sixth ribs toward the back a little, and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And three cauteries from behind, one between the two spatula-bones, and two on the sides of the chest below the cautery between the two spatula-bones.
And you ought not to press your hand with the cautery, but rather have it above the surface of the skin sniffing out the odor. And some ancient men have said that there are men who use a cautery of iron like a needle; they light it and put it inside between the ribs until it reaches the wound and pus comes out, as we have said happens with a liver wound.
But with this piercing of the cautery there is fear that either the weak man dies immediately or a fistula happens in the spot which does not heal.
CHAPTER XXXII on the way to cauterize the Spleen.
When you treat the disease of the spleen according to what we have said from curing diseases in division, and your cure does not help, then there is cautery on it in three ways which are all right.Et modo de illo quod est contra femur, scilicet super partem testiculos et contra os ilium quod est ad femur et ubi tu excides ad caput sibi: et super partem testiculos quidam posuerunt alium cauterium intra, qui non sunt recti.
One of which is to make three cauterizations or four according to the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauteries of the liver, the figure of which precedes.
And let there be between each cauterization the amount of the thickness of a finger, or a little more.
And let the mode of the cautery, which we said in the cautery of the liver be equal.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie back on his back.
And another mode of cauterization is: that you apply the red-hot cautery having two vertices, which we said in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus; and raise the skin which is on the direct line of the spleen, where the left elbow of the patient comes; and your lifting up be such as you lift the skin according to the breadth of the body, that the cauteries may fall according to the length of the body.
Then insert the two vertices very hot until with them you penetrate the skin on the other part; then pull out the cautery; there will therefore be four cauteries.Et si non possis facere cauteria in his locis, quae diximus: sed tamen debes esse certus de locis, ut non erraris: et fac cauterium in medio inter duo prima cauteria, qui sunt circa mediam lineam splenis, quod est prope mediam lineam corporis: et si non possit facere intra mediam lineam corporis: sed tamen debet esse prope mediam lineam: et fiunt ergo cauteria tria. And if you cauterize with a cautery having three threads.
Then take care of the cautery after you have taken it off to emit pus for many days, because it is more conducive to healing than other remedies that preceded it.
The method of cauterizing in Hydrocephalus.
Chapter 33.
A cautery does not work on hydrocephalus unless the scrotum is properly opened.Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.
When you are treating hydrocephalus with the methods of treatment that we have discussed above and treatment does not work, then you should cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery over the stomach, and another cautery over the liver, and a cautery over the spleen, and two cauteries after the back between the vertebrae, and one cautery in the chest, and another in the abdomen: and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.
Then leave the cautery open so that it emits pus for a long time.Et postquam dimiserit pus, de novo confice eadem loca cum cauteriis.
And do not discharge the sick person from treatment after cauterization with it; for there ought to be applied to him two remedies, and healing will speedily come to him by God's help.
The form of the cautery with which one cauterizes the belly should be a ring, according to its previous form; and that with which one cauterizes the back should be olive-shaped, according to its previous form.
On the manner of cauterizing feet and legs. Chapter 34.
When they are apoplectic in a water-sweller and full of yellow water, one should cauterize above the instep of the foot which is between the ear and the ring: then lift up your hand with the cautery and do not twist it, and next lift up your hand and do not return to it at all.
For the yellow water will be burned up, and the cautery must take this form.Et non facias cauterium in pedibus cum quo sedet: sed facies super talones.
Then do two cauteries on both legs, in every leg, and the cautery is to be made with the blade of the cautery; and it is to be done according to the length of the leg, one under the knee and another below that, about midway down the leg; and over each hip are to be two cauteries: let the cautery then remain open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may flow out from it, and then treat it with the rest which we have said.Et non facias cauterium in pedibus cum quo sedet: sed facies super talones.
On the manner of cauterizing in a belly-sweller.Caput XXXV. Chapter 35.
When there is a discharge from the stomach due to cold and moistness, and it weakens the retaining and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines, and it is treated with various remedies but does not heal, and you see the invalid enduring the cautery of overflowing strength, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, according to what has preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cautery, and with four cauteries around the navel with a very subtle knife, and with a cautery on the alcatara above the anus, or with two cauteries.
And if you see abundant moistness and the invalid enduring it, then cauterize him with a cautery over the breastbone, and with a cautery over each hip; and perhaps you may add two small cauteries near the upper part of the stomach.
For this is a successful treatment, whose prescription does not go astray.
On how to cauterize hemorrhoids.
Chapter 36.
When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one hemorrhoid, and they are from thick humors, coldnesses, or corrupt moistnesses, and they are treated with what we have said in the section on ano-rectal diseases, but the treatment accomplishes nothing: then cauterize them with three cauteries over the lower part of the spine below the navel a little bit in the shape of a triangle, and with two cauteries below the umbilical almost the distance of two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled and his food does not digest, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery according to what has preceded; and with a cautery over his liver, and another over his spleen with a very subtle knife; and leave the cautery open for some time; then treat him until he heals.
On how to cauterize ulcers after their excision.
Chapter 37.Quilibet ulcus, quod est post excisionem per omnia corporis partes, cauterizatur cum cauterio circuli in circulo circumferentiis super margines eius: et secundum magnam uirum altheluli, ita facies cauteria magna uirtute, et non facias parua cauteria.
When you cut off a tumor, then ignite the cautery which is like a burning brand.
Then thrust the red hot cautery into the cut off tumor; and hold your hand there until the cautery has reached the orifice of the vein from which the blood flows: do this once or twice. If therefore there are many tumors, then cauterize each one separately with the cautery as we have described above.
Then treat them with what we taught you about ointments until they heal.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alkalai, it is most useful for bleeding.Si vero uultis conserare althelul cum lacte feminae, post ea quae diximus faciuntur, et uoluit lacte, et non curat, deinde incidi eum cum scalpelio et lana intus in illum inficere, donec sanet.
If you wish to heal the tumor with a woman's milk, after doing those things which we have described above, and it will not be healed by milk, then cut it out with a scalpel and insert wool into it until it is healed.¶ On the manner of cauterizing an ulcer in the anus.
Chapter 38
When it is not submitting to the cut and operation which we described above in its place, and if it shudders away from that, perhaps it will be healed with a cautery.Ergo faciunt hanc operationem.
When therefore a fistula occurs in some person and becomes old, pus flows out of it, and corrupted moisture.
It is therefore becoming that you should probe it with a fine tent.
Then find out the amount of its depth with a tent.
Then heat up the cautery, which is like an iron.
Then put it into the fistula itself and the amount in which the claw entered. And repeat over it cautery, until all those corrupted bodies are burnt, once or twice or thrice according to the amount of your need.
And guard yourself from burning of the nerve, if it is there, or a great vein; or if the fistula extends to the body of the ureter, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all those places.
And do not do that unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place; and consider, because it is not penetrating.
Then cure the place until it heals.
But if the place is sealed and materials are cut off from it, and remains thus for a long time; then know that it is now completely healed.
And if materials are not cut off from it, then know that there is penetration or in its depth is rotten bone or almost of those; whose recollection will come in its place.
On the mode of cauterizing the Kidneys.
Chapter 39.
When there is pain in the kidneys from coldness or gross moisture, and it is heightened because of this in a sick person, then one should cauterize it over almenthene over the kidneys with a cautery of a small claw, whose predecessor was recollection; for which see above.
And perhaps we will cauterize it secondly in the same almethene.
Therefore three lines will come.
Therefore they are more in promise.
On the mode of cauterizing the Bladder.
Chapter 40. When weakness and softening from cold and moisture occur in the bladder, to the point that it cannot retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the scrotum above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic hair begin, and with a cautery instrument on the right side of the scrotum, and another on the left: and let the length of this cauterization be equal to the width of the thumb. And cauterize it with a cautery instrument on the lower part of the back, or with two cauteries if you need it: and let it be according to what preceded in the cautery of the foreskin.
Here ends the translation. Of the mode of cauterizing the matrix.
When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and it is prohibited by them from conception, and its menses are corrupted, and their production is delayed, and pain happens to her at her coming, then it is fitting that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery instrument below on the alcate, or with two cauteries: and let the foreskin cautery be as above.
Here begins the 41st chapter.
Of the mode of cauterizing an ulcer in a dislocation.
When the mucous humidities are poured out to the tip of the ulcer, and its exit is caused from its place; and a sign of this is that one leg is prolonged over the other when they compare themselves to each other: and the seat of the dislocation is found empty.
You must therefore cauterize the patient over the anus with a cautery similar to a circle; after you mark it with a cautery around the anus as it is revealed: and so that the anus falls in the middle of the circle.
And let the form of the cautery precede in the cauterization of the stomach.
If you do not have this cautery, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-wood cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin throughout.
Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ Of the manner of cauterizing in sciatica.Si autem sciatica perduxerit ad patellam: But if sciatica extends to the knee:Chapter 43.
When pain occurs in the anus and the cause is coldness and humidity, and the patient is treated with that which we mentioned in division, and treatment does not help and it is prolonged: then you must free the patient from thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and the like.Et cum eo soluto, oportet ut cauterizes pixidem super pixidem Anchae cum cauterio circulo, et cauterize ad modum, qui diximus in sciatica: si autem non possit tolleri causta, quia multum dolit: tunc oportet ut facias eam circuire de fornice usque ad patellam cum encaustro lini et saponis, et cum oleo rosmarini, et postea cauterizes super pixidem cum cauterio circulo, et facias in medio circuli cauterio puntum: et facias cauterium secundum quantitatem doloris, quod sentit infirmus: et facias eum post cauterizationem ut tegeat, et pones super punctum olebaculum, donec cadat cauterium, et facias eum postea solvere cum aceto diluito.
Then cauterize it.
And the way of cauterization is according to two ways: either with a cauterization with burning medicines or with fire.
A cauterization with fire is according to many modes.
One of which is to cauterize above the anchor of the vein in three triangular cauteries, according to this form.Et postea facies ligationem et post ligationem stetit et post stetitionem dabis bevaculam ad remarginatam.
And after you shall do the ligature and after the ligature you shall stand and after standing you shall give the bevaculum for the closing up.And you must make a good or bad depth in them.
And let there be space between every cautery like the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be olive oil.Si vero uenam non potes tangere neque appropiam ad tangendum, ut facias cauterium, fac ligaturam, si quod est extra superficem carnis, et stetit, et dabis bevaculam remarginatam: facit enim bevacula lessionem profunde.
But if you cannot touch the vein nor come near to touching it, so that you may make the cautery, make a ligature of what is outside the surface of the flesh, and stands, and give the bevaculum for the closing up: for the bevaculum makes the wound deeply.When-ever then the cauterization is in the middle above the head of it.
Wherefore there are four cauteries.Sed si uenam non potes tangere neque appropiam ad tangendum, ut facias cauterium, fac ligaturam extra superficialem carnis et stetit et dabis bevaculam remarginatam: facit enim bevacula lessionem profunde.
And if you cauterize with a circle, whose shape has preceded it in cauterizing the separation of the ankh by one: so that the circle contains the entire ankh.
And burn the thickness of the skin all over.
This is the mode of cautery in sciatica when the pain adheres to the ankh itself and does not extend as far as the hip and leg.
But if it extends as far as the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, over the place to which the invalid points, where there is pain; and with your cautery on the shin four fingers from the lower end: and let the cautery be a knife. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.
If the invalid points out that the pain extends as far as the toes, then cauterize it there where he points with a pricking cautery, three or four or more times, if necessary.Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.
And if he points out that the pain is on the inside of the knee and leg, then cauterize it there with a single knife cautery.Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.
And be careful in all your cautery that you do not go to extremes with the cautery so as to burn a nerve or large artery and bring about harm through it upon the invalid, or contraction.Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.
And indeed I have already seen one and another of those who cauterized above the shin and went to extremes in cauterizing, and the leg swelled up until a tumor followed, and it was perforated all through, and the whole foot was ruined: then there came on relaxation of the bowels and death afterwards.Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.
If there is pain in two parts at the same time, cauterize both according to this method.
And certain wise men have said concerning the cautery of an ulcer, that such is the mode of that cautery.
Make the cautery iron of brass, whose diameter is half a palm; and let it be at its aperture according to the thickness of a thumb nail, or less by a little; and within that brass let there be another brass.
And let the space which is between each brass be according to the quantity of a knuckle; and let them be open on two sides; and let their thickness be almost the thickness of a knuckle, or two knuckles; and make for them a handle out of iron fitting into the bras.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in the fire until it turns red, and casts out sparks; then let it be laid upon the scurf of an ulcer lying upon its back upon the sound side.
Cauterize him therefore with three round cauteries at one time.
Then leave off for three days.
Afterwards dress the wound with ointments, and leave it open through many days.
Then heal it with an ointment until it is healed.Et haec est forma cauterii.
Albucasis says; we have used this kind of cautery very little, on account of the terror of its appearance; and for that reason, because we found few who would consent to lie upon it.
Nevertheless, it is one of the good cauteries, for him who will endure it, and finds with it its place.
But the cautery with burning medicines is such, that you make two bras rings, through which descends the pin of its door of brass or iron, whose length is equal to the thickness of a wall; and let the thickness of these be as two knots, or almost so.
And let the space between each be equal to the thickness of a finger; and let them be open beneath and above; and let that which contains them be hollow within according to this form.Et fac intra illam armillam samium tertium.
Then lay her down upon a couch with her affected side uppermost and the sound side underneath.
And press your hand hard upon her affected side.
Then place a hot-water bottle between her two breasts, which has been gently warmed by fire for a short time, and let it remain there for about an hour; and the patient must tolerate the heat of this, until the pain is eased.
Then lift up your hand with the instrument and wash away all of the hot water from the wound with sweet water; then leave it alone for three days.Et si post tres dies mordicatio non desistat, eleua manum tuam cum instrumento et funde super ancho aquam frigidam: deinde absterge illud aqua dulci.
And if after three days the pain does not cease, lift up your hand with the instrument and place cool water over the wound; then wash it with sweet water. And put butter over it until the blackness of the burn is removed: leave it alone for several days, and let pus flow from it.
For that is the last in the wound.Et si non remoueatur nigredo adustionis, post aliquot dies, eleua manum tuam cum instrumento et funde super ancho olea: deinde absterge aqua dulci et dimitte illud.
And if the blackness of the burn is not removed after a few days, lift up your hand with the instrument and place olive oil over the wound; then wash it with sweet water and leave it alone. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
If the pain extends to the hip or leg: make her lie on her back with her affected side uppermost as you did for the wound.Et si post dies aliquot non remoueatur dolor, deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento et funde super illud olea rubea, et absterge aqua dulci: deinde fac statum in eo quod continet aquam calidam secundum modum ante dictum.
And if the pain is not eased after a few days, lift up your hand with the instrument and place red oil over the wound; then wash it with sweet water. Then have her lie on her back with her affected side uppermost as before.And this is how you prepare hot water: I have already written about that in my treatise on medicine.
Take alkali and unquenched lime, each one-sixth part; grind both, and place them in a new pot whose lower part is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity so that it can be inserted into the pot: and place under the bottom of the pot another vessel that has been treated; and pour over the alkali and lime sweet water so that they are both submerged by a digit; after which you compress them with your hand in good compression: and leave the pot, until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the treated vessel.
Then gather that water, and throw it over another stone; and pound until it is renewed.
For it will then be very strong and acute, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in the cauterisation of other members.
Because it effects the operation of its fire.
And from medicines there are, with which they are cauterised, also like thesiel and mastic, and honey of dates, and chalk with soap, so that both be mixed together.  [The word "it" (ipsa) in the Latin is ambiguous here, and could refer either to "water" or "chalk", depending on which is intended as the subject of the clause; I have rendered it as "chalk" for the sake of sense, but the meaning may not be precise.]
And Galen indeed has narrated, by whose cure a certain man was cured of the pain of ancha and sciatic vein: and he magnified it to be of such strength.
And he said, because it did not need another cure, and because he was healed by the application of it, until he said, that perhaps he had entered into a bath, and came out from it already healed. And it is, as it is taken from the green of wormwood; and if the green is not found, let the dry be taken, fresh; and it is bruised a great deal with a little fat, and let it be put over ancha, where there is pain, or thigh, or in hip: and let it be bound, and let it be left for a quantity of three hours, or according to the quantity that the sick person feels the sedation of burning.
Then let him enter into a bath.
When therefore his body becomes moistened, let him be entered into a bed.
For the pain will depart, and he will be healed.
And you shall know, that it is not fitting for any one to use cautery with these medicines unless after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides who said this, that the dung of she-goats, when with it is cauterised the sciatic vein, brings relief to it; and the cautery is made according to this way.
A piece of wool is wetted with old oil and placed over the deep spot which lies between the thumb and big toe and is closer to the big toe.
Then take some dry goat dung, ignite it in a fire until it turns to charcoal.
Then place it on the wool and leave it there until it goes out.
Then repeat this process.
You must not stop doing this until sensation returns to the affected area and the pain subsides.Si autem non possit ire usque ad ancham, sed sentiat in uno loco solum, et illo stetit, sed non poterit ambulare, tamen faciat sicut diximus, donec perueniat sensus super mediatione:
If however he is unable to go as far as the ankle but feels it only in one spot and cannot walk, he should still do what we have said until sensation returns to the affected area. This method of cauterization is called Goats-dung Cauterization.
On cauterization for back pain.Sumatur linteus albus, et fricatur cum oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum doloris, et dimittatur, donec extinguatur:
Chapter 44.Sumatur linteus albus, and it is rubbed with old oil, and placed over the spot of pain, and left there until it goes out:
Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either through an accident or a blow, or excessive evacuation and similar things due to infusion of cold and moist matter. Cauterization does not occur however except in this one type only which is due to infusion of cold matter.Sumatur ergo linteus albus: et infundatur super eum oleo antiquo, ut sit calidus:
Take then a piece of white linen and moisten it with old oil so that it is warm. After the patient has evacuated with fetid pills and similar things, three lines are to be made according to the breadth of his back where there is pain, after you have made signs with caustic on each line five cauteries or more according to the amount that comes from the tolerance of the patient due to its strength: cauterization is then performed with cauterizator.
And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries or four, with the nail-tipped cautery according to this form:Sumatur ergo linteus albus, et fricatur cum oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum doloris, et dimittatur donec extinguatur.
A way to cauterize in case of a gibbousness.
Chapter 45.
This disease often happens to small children.
And a sign of this disease in children is: what happens to him above, the stricture in panting at the elevation and movement; and you find at last at the lower end of the back and its knots, which has already started to protrude over the other vertebrae.
When therefore you see this, and wish to make it, then cauterize it with a cautery which is a circle according to this form.Et si tibi placeat facere cauterium ad modum incisionis ut incaepsit super eum, quia bene fit, nam illa laciniae consuitur et eleuatur per eam in modum quod descripsit.
And he shall take cautery over every part of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebrae with a point-cauterizer, two or three lines; and let the points be close to each other.
Then dress the wound until it is healed as we have said.
And beware lest you apply cautery to the lump which forms in a nerve-spasm.
¶ Of the manner of cauterizing in Gout and pains of the joints. Chapter 46.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humours which flow to any limb whatever of the body, then when they occur in the feet, it is usual for physicians to call them by their proper name, Gout.
When therefore gout of a cold cause is being treated with modes of cure, and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.Et tamen in ista causatione cauteria debet administrari postea, quando dolor sit remissus et sensa est cadaverosa frigiditas corporis.
And yet in this cause cautery ought to be applied afterwards when the pain is lessened and there is a corpse-like coldness felt in the body. And it is fitting that you should cauterize him after evacuations around the joint of the foot with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive oil.
Whose form is this:
And if you need to puncture the surface of the foot, then do it with a point-cauterizer.Et si ad articulum pedis, et ad caput pedis, et ad articulum genuae, et ad quodlibet locum corporis, qui est necessarius ut cauterizes, et si dolores non remittantur, tamen postea fac cauteria super locum, donec sentiat cadaverosas frigiditas.
What if the pains ascend as far as the knee or other joints and this often happens then cauterize it above all of the knees with three cauteries or four from all sides with this same cautery called Claveli. And if you need more cauteries, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery but rather that it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If however the pains ascend as far as the knees and back then administer what we have said from the cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, then mark around the circumference of the nails as two lines revolve.
If however some pain remains in the fingers, then mark them on each joint and above the palm of the hand.Quidam autem medici ponunt super omnem nodum duos punctos, ut sit punctus superior ad finem unguis et inferior circumflectatur usque ad radicem unguis.
If however the pains rise up into the elbow-joints, or the shoulder-joints, then cauterize both of them on every part.
And do not discharge the sick person from a good regimen, from the taking of medicines.
For if a good regimen is kept, and the phlegm is expelled with God's help by means of this cautery, he will be cured.
Ch. 14: On the cautery-method for Ruptures.
Ch. 47:
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine descends, or at the scrotum near to the testicle, and it is an incipient case: then you ought to order the sick person to take a bath on that day itself.
And let him use laxatives, so that excrement may descend from his belly.Quo facto, faciat cauterium in loco ruptura; et non loquatur ad eum de cauterio: sed faciat illum comessationem, et cauteria subcomessatione.
Then have him lie between your hands on his back; and order him to hold in his breath until it comes out, or the scrotum or intestine appears.Quam ob causam non debes loqui ad eum de cauterio donec videas apparere: ne timeat uirum, et movatur uentris eius, et uel apparatu cauterii, vel uel ex omni causa, et morer.
Then bring him back with your fingers and make a mark with cauterisation-irons under the rupture above the pubic bone, in a sign whose end is similar to half of a circle towards the upper body.Et facias aliam comessationem: et postea facias alterum cauterium in medio entre os pectinis super medietatem circuli.
Then make another bath: and after that make a second cautery in the middle between the pubic bone above the middle of the circle.Then heat the cautery, whose form is thus, until it becomes white-hot, and throw off sparks.Si autem non apparuerit ad te ex uulnera cautei, facias postea tertium cauterium, sub omnini Ruptura ad medietatem circuli inferiora corporis.
Then return the intestine or the bladder to its cavity.
Then the assistant should place his hand over the wound so that the intestine does not slip out. You have already opened up the space between the patient's thighs and placed a bowl under him; one assistant holds his hands on the patient's thighs and the other on his chest.
Then place the cautery instrument on the wound, with your hand holding it upright and steady.
And hold it there until you reach the bone, or repeat the procedure with another application of the cautery if you do not reach the bone with the first application.
And be very careful to avoid burning the intestine during cauterization, or else a terrible misfortune, even death, could occur.
And you should know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation will have been in vain.Deinde fac ut post cauterizationem puluinar detur sibi sub capite.
Then afterwards a bowl should be placed under the patient's head.And the cautery instrument for children should be fine, according to their size.
Then treat it with the remaining ointment until it heals.Si autem non consenuit post octo uigilias, et superueniunt aliae ulcerationes, et non curantur per omnes medicas suas, utpote infantes in hac parte corporis:
But if after eight watchings, other ulcerations develop and do not heal despite all the remedies, especially in children, where this occurs in that part of the body:and let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound heals.Et sit mensura cauterii subtilis secundum mensuram eorum: et si consenuit os cum cauterio, non facias aliam operationem, sed curaris per unguentum, quod tibi fecerunt apothecarii.
And the cautery instrument should be fine according to their size; and if you reach bone with the cautery, do not perform another operation but treat it with ointment as the apothecaries have made for you.And you must give him nourishment throughout the time of his cure, so that it softens his belly: so that his intestine does not come out at the wound or be expelled through it.
Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then administer a bandage made skillfully and hold it on him for another forty days.Et si uenerit ad te infirmus cuius non est os apertum neque ulceratio, sed est peritis dolor super ventrem eius, et non potest exire de lecto suo propter dolorem:
For when he uses this treatment, he is healed by a complete healing.
When, however, ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen and are incipient, and one sees that they add nothing, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let what is burnt from then on be like the third of it.
Then cure him, with that which we have said; and let nothing be added.Et si postea accidat aliter, cura aliter.
And if afterwards it happens otherwise, treat it differently. And some of the first ones have already said to cauterize a rupture with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it is marked with encaustic, and there is put a line which is through the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line at the bottom.Et postea faciunt fere ut omnia cauteria quae sunt super linee inferioare, quod non sit super linea superiore. And then they make almost all the cauteries which are above the lower line, so that it is not over the upper line. And place your hand in the middle with the nail cautery.Et depone per omnem Rupturam et per omnes partes eius.
But the first cautery is easier and better.Et postea ponatur linea super lateres omnes ut antea, quomodo fuit faciendum in principio. And then put a line over all the sides as before, how it was to be done at first.§ On the way of cauterizing for pains because of a fall, or a blow.Et si Ruptura sit in parte lateris, et non sit propter casum aut percussionem, sed propter uentriculi et peritis plerumque morbos:
And if the rupture is in the side-part, and it is not because of a fall or a blow, but because of maladies of the belly and intestines more often: Head XLVIII.Et si Ruptura sit per dislocationem et per morbos uentriculi et peritis, et per casum aut percussionem, cura ut supra diximus cum incisione.
When pain occurs in some members from a fall, or a blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and does not yield to treatment with medicines: then one must cauterize it with the punctured cautery.
And let the cautery of each member be a cautery according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its power, and the location of its torsion and pain from it.Et sit cauterium ut sit inter omnes partes eius: nam si super illum facietur incisia ad inferius et ad latera, erunt dolores in omni parte, et in toto membru, et non confert curare omnia dolores cum medicinis.
If it is healed by the first cautery, it is good.
If not: then repeat the cautery on the same spot.
Because according to the custom of these pains, they move from one member to another that is close to it.
Therefore you must follow them with the cautery until the patient is healed.
¶ On the method of cauterizing for Leprosy.Si lepra sit in oculis, non oportet ut excindas sed cauterizes.
Chapter 49.
But lepers are sometimes treated by cauterization with a very strong iron.
And especially of the kind of leprosy which is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile; so when you see it, consider using cauterization.
If then the leprosy is incipient and you have treated it as we said before, and it neither goes down nor stays, but you fear for the life of the patient because the corruption has seized his whole complexion; then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and a second below that towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two over the two temples, and one behind on the back of the neck.
And lightly touch with the cautery your hand until it makes a slight mark on the bone and the skin is drawn up; so that the expiration of the gross vapors may be driven out from it, and cauterize also over the spleen itself according to what went before.
But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient and appears manifestly; then you must cauterize with these cauteries which we said were to be used on the head, and a cautery on the end of his nose, and two cauteries on the two jaws, and two cauteries on the two shoulders, and six cauteries on the six shoulder-blades, and a large one on the buttocks at the hip, and one over it in the armpit: and two over the hips: namely, over each hip with one, and two over the knees: one over each knee, and two over the shoulders, and two over the elbows, and two over the tender parts of his chest; and cauterize him on every joint out of the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet; and cauterize on every ankle-bone of his feet, and the knuckles of his hands.
And beware of the nerves which are over the ankle-bones lest you burn them.Sed postea quandoque ueluti primum cauterizares, tu ne cauterizes, donec primum carnes concrescant: et ueluti concrescent, tunc de novo cauterizes, donec concrescat: et sic de novo quousque concrescat, quod possit pati se cauteria, quae super eum fierent. And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery over the bone of the breast and another one over the bone of the stomach and another one over the liver.
And you should know that the more you add to the cautery, it is a greater remedy, and the more it confers.
And you should know that a weak person does not find pain in cauterization, as healthy people do; because his body is already numbed.
And it is necessary that the cauteries are of size and smallness according to the members and joints; according to what has preceded from the species of tools.
Chapter 50.
When a member stupes and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters but does not heal, then the stupified member is to be cauterized with cauteries according to the magnitude of the member or its smallness.
And let your cautery go a little deep into the thickness of the skin.Quod si facias aliter, non debes mirari, si sanguis superabit et venam confringat.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes it is cauterized for a kind of numbness that happens to the hand and foot at the joints of the spine where the nerves move that limb, and the numbness is removed.
But he must not do it himself unless he is wise in anatomy of the parts and the exit of nerves that move the body.
Of the way of cauterizing in Albaras.
Chapter 51.
When one ages Albaras, and does not use in it anything of the skills of medicine: then he should cauterize over it with a deep cautery, for a little according to the quantity of thickness of the skin, until the white is removed and its color changed.
Then treat it with wheat flour and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon blood, and blood of a swallow; from each there should be one part: mix all these things together, and spread them on a cloth, and attach them to the place, until it is healed.
Of the way of cauterizing in Cancer.Antiquari etiam in cancro ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, aut pedi, cum cauterio plano: postea linant super illum panem, et olem, et sal, et vinum: et faciant super eum unguentum medicinale, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaerant loco donec remoueatur cancro.
Chapter 52.
When the cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery in its circuit, just as it revolves.Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento medicinali cum suco herbae saturei, et oleo rosa, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaerant loco donec sanetur.
Then treat it with medicinal ointment with the juice of saturei herb and rose oil and pigeon blood and swallow's blood; from each there shall be one part: mix all these things together, and spread them on a cloth and attach them to the place until it is healed.The wise have said, however, that it should be cauterized with a final cautery in its center.¶ De modo cauterizandi in Morbus, qui dictur morbus pedis apud medicines.
Of the way of cauterizing in a disease which is called by physicians a foot disease.I do not think that one should be cauterized, however, because I am afraid it will be ulcerated; and indeed I have seen this several times.Et quandoque non adhaeret cauterio: sed linatur super eum panem et olem et salem et vinum, donec remoueatur malitia, et super eum unguentum cum oleo rosa, et cum sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis, et cum farina herbae saturei, et misceantur haec omnia, et liniuntur super pannum, et adhaerant loco: donec sanetur. And it is better that it should be cauterized with a circular incision around it, as we said before, or with many cauteries. § On the method of cauterization according to Adubela.
Chapter 53.
When one has an Adubela and it is delayed in ripening, either because of the surplus which causes it or because of the age of the patient when he is decrepit with little blood, or because of the time, and you want to hasten the ripening of the Adubela, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by pricking.
Then leave it alone.Et post dies plures, si non maturuerit, de novo eandem circumferens cum circulo cauteriza, et sic iterum demittere.
And she will hasten with the ripening.
But if you wish to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery of this shape.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelu, until it penetrates the skin, and let the cautery be from that which follows weak, so that the course of pure may be alleviated.
Then heal it until it is cured.
¶ Of the way of cauterizing in the corrosive evil. Chapter LIIII.
A corroder is not except a corruption in a walking member, and it corrodes itself, as fire eats dry wood.
If you see a corroder in a place that will bear cautery with fire, then heat many cauteries, small and large claws according to what will suit the place where it is corroder.
Then cauterize it from every part until you eradicate all the corruption and none of it remains completely.Et custodi placeat donec sanetur. Then leave it for three days, and apply ground sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas until all scars and corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If you see then that after three days healthy flesh is born from the wound, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery over what remains of the corrupted areas.
And scrape and treat it with an acute medicine whenever necessary.
For indeed, the flesh rises up from the place of cautery.
However, cautery with fire is a swift action; and I have already mentioned cauterization of that with an acute medicine in division: so take it there when you need it.
On the method of cauterizing warts and verrucas. Chapter 45.
This disease often occurs on the lower parts of the feet; and it is a coarse, infiltrated thing that injures the foot.Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio. And the cautery itself is according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.Namque qui facit cauterium cum igne, igni accendendo super locum cauterizandum excitat eum ad uigoram calidam: et postea cum frigescet, ponit medicamenta super eum quae eradicent omnem corruptelam.
For he who performs cautery with fire kindles fire over the cauterized area to heat it to a red-hot temperature; and afterward, when it has cooled off, he puts remedies on it that will eradicate all corruption.And as much as is with fire, so that the cautery concavus similar to a feather of a chicken: which is done from iron, according to the quantity that contains the claw from every part, and is subtle of the edges.Et sit subtilium marginum: quod si quaeritigeneret de locis vicinis, et non possit, ponat super eum aquam calidam, in qua contineatur sal, cum oleo: et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.
Then put it over the fire until it is hot. Then, move the cautery round the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it for three days, until you see pus forming. Then cover the wound with a plaster made from mallows bruised with salt; and let this remain on it all night. For it will be eradicated by its roots.Et postea, depone super eum unctum cum oleo et vinagre in parte, qua est clauus: et dimitte hunc unctum super ipsum per tres dies.
Then anoint the place with ointment of generative flesh, until it is healed.
If they are not converted, and occur often on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet; then you should apply cautery with hot water to them: and take a pipe made from brass, or iron, or from goose feather; and place it over the nail, or wart.
Then pour into the pipe a little hot water; hold your hand and with it roll it about a little, so that the rim of the pipe may be impressed on the root of the nail, and the hot water may find its way to the bottom, to the root of the nail: and let the sick person wait a little over the bite of the hot water.
Then leave it, for the nail will be eradicated with its roots.Et si fiant in pedibus inter solas et artus: depone super eam unctionem argenti vivificati: et reuolue eam per tres dies, donec eradicetur radice.
Thus do with them one after another until you have come upon all those of them that are in the body.
Then heal them when they have been uprooted by that ointment which engenders flesh.
Of the manner of cauterizing in a tremor.
Chapter 56.
When it happens that any one has a tremor from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or some other [ailment]: then he ought to be cauterized with four cauteries, or five, upon the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra a cautery; also upon his breast a cautery, and over his stomach a cautery.
For the tremor is quieted by the olive-oil cautery, and speedily the health of the patient from coldness returns. Of the manner of cauterizing Al-Batri.
Chapter 57.
Sometimes there are expelled from the body evil Albathirs, that is to say, pustules, which are caused by foul matter.And these it behoves you first of all to open with a cautery; and when they have been opened, to lay upon them an ointment made with vinegar, in order that their matter may come out: then take care of them with that which engenders flesh, after they have been cleansed.
It is therefore necessary at the first appearance of them to cauterize every head of a pustule with a thin cautery of myrrh wood, whose end has been heated with fire; then when they are cauterized, you must wash them with vinegar and water, until their matter is cleansed.
Or with the root of Long Pepper.
Or with a lentil cautery. And when they are cauterized with a cautery of the bean-plant, in the beginning of their coming out; and do not increase: and the superfluity is broken up making them, and healing takes place from them.
However, it ought to be done after a bleeding.And if the cautery does not work, make a mixture of rose-water in which you will put the powder of the bean-plant and rose-oil, and with this wash them: and they will heal at once.And if there is any difficulty in cauterizing or washing, then it must be done by means of a needle, or with a small knife.
Of the manner of cauterizing in an arterial bleeding from a wound.
Chapter 58. CHAPTER LVIII. It often happens that there is a flow of blood from an artery which has been cut at an external wound, or in making an incision into an ulcer, or in cauterizing a limb, and similar places ; and it becomes difficult to stop it.
When therefore it happens to anyone that this occurs, then quickly bring your hand to the opening of the artery and place over it your index finger; and press tightly until the flow of blood is stopped under your finger so that nothing issues out from it.Postea tene digitum tuum in eo loco, usquequod tempus sit, donec fluxus sanguinis desicat et coagitatur: nam non debet remittere stringendo, donec non sit coagulatio sub digito tuo. Afterwards hold your finger in that place until there is time for the flow of blood to dry and coagulate; for it must not be loosed from being pressed until there is a coagulation under your finger.Then put into the fire cauterizing instruments, small olive-wood splinters, many of them and large in number: and blow upon them until they are fiercely heated.Postea tollendo digitum tuum de super orificium arteriae, statim applica super eum cauteria oliuaria ignita: et tene super eo, donec coaguletur sanguis, et fiant albi.
Then taking one of them, small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery is torn, apply the cautery quickly over the vein after you have withdrawn your finger quickly; and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.Si tamen per accidens alicui accidit ita, ut non possit capere digitum suum ad orificium arteriae, quod incisa est, sed debet eum remittere a stringendo et relaxare, tunc trahat se in aliquid faciendo, donec sanguis fluat per totum corpus, et moratur ita: nam non debet statuo per accidens uel per causam alicuius.
If when you have taken away the instrument with which you have stopped the hole of the artery and put out the cautery, you should then take another cautery that is quickly ready from among those that are prepared in the fire. You must not cease doing this one after another until the blood is stanched.
And beware lest you burn the nerve that is there, and another evil accident happen to the invalid. And you should know that when blood flows from an artery it is not possible to stanch it, especially if the artery is large unless with one of the four modes.
Or by cautery as we have said.
Or by extraction when it has not been extracted. For when it is extracted its extremities are contracted and the blood is stanched.Et si non possit aliter fieri, ad faciendum extractio est necesse teli in arteriam introducere.
For when it is extracted its extremities are contracted and the blood is stanched.Et si non possit aliter fieri, ad faciendum extractio est necesse teli in arteriam introducere. Or if this cannot be done then it is necessary to introduce a needle into the artery for the purpose of extraction.Or it should be bound with a strong ligature thread.Et si non possit aliter fieri, sanguinem debet tolerare, donec venae sectiones per se confringantur, et mortem suscipiant.
Or they may be placed over the medicine itself, which is to cut off the blood, and tied with a decent ligature.
But he who performs the operation of this incision with a ligature, and compression with a bandage, or by application of caustics and similar substances, does not in fact completely cure him, except rarely.
But if this happens to anyone without the presence of a doctor and medicine, then he should begin by placing his index finger over the opening of the vein, as we have described, and tightly constrict it, until the blood is cut off from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.Postea remittatur constrictio, et puluinus autem adhaerens manet: tumque incipiat praecidere arteriolae, donec sanguis ex ea fluat.
Then the constriction is released and the bandage left in place; then he should begin to cut the small arteries, until blood flows from them. And the finger must not be removed but always wet with very cold water over the top of it, until the blood congeals and swells and is cut off.Si postea sanguis renuat, et uenat per eam: tunc incipiat iterum ligare arterias cum puluinari constrictione, donec sanguis obsessus sit, et abscindatur. If the blood afterwards returns and flows through it, then he should begin again to tie the arteries with a bandage until the blood is cut off. And in the meantime let him consider what he needs from cauterization or medicine.Si autem non possit perferre, neque sanguis renuat: tunc dissecatur illa parte, et lymphe abscindatur cum uena.
But if he cannot endure it, and the blood does not return, then that part is cut open, and the lymph is cut off with the vein.End of First Part.
The Second Part of Albucatis's Surgical Book On incision, piercing and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar things.Quilibet medicus per se scit de incisione et perforatione: quare non ad longum est verbum.
Every doctor knows about incision and piercing; therefore there is no need for a long explanation.We have already said in the First Chapter that every disease which needs cauterization or medicine with burning caustic, and the occasions of it, its causes, and the instruments of it, and the forms of cauteries.Et quod libet de his omnes medicus scit per se, et potest praecipere illos. And whatever he wishes to know about them every doctor knows by himself and can prescribe them.And I have placed there chapters from the head to the foot.Quod si quid alicui dubitet de his, perlegat capitula illa, et inveniat rem edendam: quare non teneo me ad amplius verbum.
And I will proceed in this chapter in that same way: so that the seeker may find what he is seeking. And before I begin it, you should learn, O sons, that in this chapter there is the same fear as that which was in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of that it is necessary that there be even greater precaution in it, since in the operation which is in this chapter there often occurs a discharge with blood, with which life stands at the opening of the vein, or incision over an ulcer, or opening of an exit wound, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which trembling and fear are joined, and in many of them death occurs.
And I warn you that this not happen to you in which there is hesitation, for sometimes men's modes of being fall upon you with their modes of infirmity.
For there are some who become angry with their illness, and death is light for him because of the vehemence of what he finds from his illness and the length of its malevolence.Et est alius qui cum egreditur de domo sua ad operationem suam et redit ad eandem, quae perstat cum uigilia, ubi pernoctat in vestibus uestibus, quia debet exuere vestimenta sua et lavare se et epungere: et uenit ad eandem cum uigilia, et facit sibi in domo operationem et curat se.
And there is another who goes out of his house to his work and returns to the same one, which stands with a watch, where he spends the night in the clothes of the watch, because he must take off his own clothes and wash himself and bandage himself; and he comes to the same one with a watch, and he makes for himself in his house an operation and treats himself.And with illness there is fear that indicates death.
And there are some who give their own medicine, and enrich you with it, hoping for health; but their illness is lethal.Et ex eis sunt qui faciunt clysteres, et sicut uiderint tibi apud uenam, ita faciunt: neque perniciem faciunt tibi, sed sperant te in sanitatem redeuntem. You therefore ought not to agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is like that.
And let your caution be more than your greed and your avarice.
And you must not presume to accept anything from him unless after certain knowledge which verifies it with you that to which a praiseworthy succession comes.
And use for the cure of all your sick people prognosis and indication of that to which it may be convenient for salvation.
For in that is for you a helper in acquiring fame and glory, memory and praise.
May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding, and not take from you guidance and inspiration; for that is in his hand.
And indeed I arranged this Chapter distinguishing by Chapters, according to what precedes in the Chapter on cautery, from the neck until the feet; so that you may be relieved of what you wish for from it, and what you need.
Of the cure of Water which is collected in the heads of boys.
Chapter 1.¶ Si ergo puer cum aqua in capite ad uos accesserit, facitis eum intrare domum uestram et stetit intra domum: et si post illud diuersitas quaedam in capite eius appaererit, quod est in capite eius, sed non est in capite, sed est in vertice eius.
If then a boy with water in his head comes to you, let him enter your house and stand inside the house; and if after that some change whatever appears in his head, what is in his head, but not in his head, but is in the vertex of his head.Know that this sickness happens often to boys at birth: or when the midwife grips the boy's head without gentleness.
And also it happens even from a hidden cause which is not known.¶ Si ergo uis istae curari, ueniat ad te medicus, qui cognoscere possit ex iis signis qualis sit causam eius: et post hanc uerificationem et cognitionem, faciat eum intrare termas.
If then you wish this to be cured, let the physician come to you who can know from these signs what the cause of it is; and after this verification and knowledge, let him go into a bath-house.And indeed I have not seen this sickness in any other than boys: and towards every one whom I have seen suffer from it death has hastened; because of that therefore it seemed to me good to dismiss an operation in it.
And I indeed saw from among them a boy whose head was filled with water, and his head swelled every day, until he could not sit upon himself, because of the size of his head; and the humidity increased, until he died.
And this indeed humidity, is either aggregated between the skin and bone: or is aggregated under the bone above the jaw.
And the operation on him, if there is humidity between skin and bone, and there is an ulcer that is small, then you must find in the middle of the head a split one inch wide: and the length of the split should be about two inches long, so that the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of spatulitis.
If therefore the humidity is more augmented, and the ulcer is greater, then put those two splits, according to this form.Et si non possit ponere duas fissuras, sit una in medio capitis cum fissura faciendi latus quasi unius modii, et percutiens intra illa duo partes ut faciat latus quasi unius modii, et percutiens intra illa duo partes ut faciat latus quasi unius modii.
And if the humidity is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the joints of the head open from every part: and water depresses when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide from you: then you must find in the middle of the head three splits, in this way.
And after the incision, extract all the humidity.Postea percuties eum intra illa quae sunt in medio capitis quasi ad caput equi donec corrant omnia humores, et postea superius ad interiora donec corrant: quoniam si non percutieris ultra modum istum, mortuus erit puer.
Then pour over it wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then loosen the ligature and dress the wound with poultices and ointments.
And don't stop binding the head tightly.
And feed the invalid dry food, little by little moistened, until he is strengthened and healed.
Another way of making an incision is to consider where there appears to be a large abscess and collection of water.
For sometimes it is found more in the back of the head or in front or on one side or the other.Et si in quolibet eorum sit, ille modus incisionis convenit ut scis.
Ascend therefore with an incision where you see a pustule and filling of water; and slit it according to what is possible for you.
And observe that you do not cut an artery, and there occurs a flow of blood, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ On the cutting of arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter 2.Et nunc de incisione arteriarum, et quomodo habentur post auras.
And now concerning the cutting of arteries and how they are found behind the ears.When a person has cataracts on his eyes or chest, and this becomes worse and medical treatment does not help, then there is only one final cure for him: cutting these two arteries.Et si accidat alicui fluxus sanguinis ad oculos et non confert curatio, et medicamenta quae superunt in oculis, et non est in illo visus: sed accidit ei sanguis claudere oculos per omnia, faciesque eius sicut facies mortuus: et si postea ille fluxus sanguinis contineatur per curas: et medicamenta quae superunt ad oculum, et non est in illo visus: sed est quasi mortuus, et sanguis in oculis manet: et facies eius sicut facies mortuus: et si ille fluxus sanguinis contineatur per curas: et medicamenta quae superunt ad oculos, et non est in illo visus: sed facies eius sicut facies mortuus.
And if a person has a blood flow to his eyes and medical treatment does not help, and the medicines which remain in his eyes do not work, but there is blood closing his eyes all over, and his face is like a dead man's face; and if afterwards this blood flow is stopped by treatment, and the medicines which remain on his eyes don't work, and he has no sight, and his face is like a dead man's face: it is necessary that you cut these arteries when the sick person bends his head.Et faciat infirmus caput suum ad os equi et faciat domitor equi pedem super os equi, et tenebit domitor equi manu sua nasum equi, et sic teneat radendo, donec videat sanguinem fluxum per os equi, et faciat domitor equi pedem super nasum equi.
Then he should rub the place with a rough cloth until the arteries appear.Et postea incide radendo per duos lateres arteriarum, et non facias profundum incisionem nec leue, ne sanguis effluat: sed facias incisiones super nasum equi donec videas sanguinem fluxum super os equi, et facias domitor equi pedem super nasum equi donec videas sanguinem fluxum per ossa oculorum.
Then the sick person should tighten his neck with whatever cloth he has.Et postea domitor equi trahat pedem suum super nasum equi donec videat sanguinem fluxum per ossa oculorum: et sic faciat donec sanguis contineatur, et faciat radendo locum cum panno aspero ut apparere arteriae.
Then consider where the vein pulses.
And their locations are places which are below the ears: and they are rarely hidden, except in some men.
Then mark with a cautery on both sides: and cut both of them with a sharp spatulum on both sides, the incision going all the way to the bone: and let it go across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the spatulum below the artery, and cut it towards the upper part with an incision.
And let the length of the incision be almost two joined fingers.
For when the vein is cut, blood will flow out in a pulsating way, which rushes to the insides with frequent beating.
But if the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a quantity of space of three fingers.Et ubi pulserit uena, incide eam cum spatulo.
Then mark with a cautery, and find up to the bone.Et si uis, fac incisionem latiorem, ut sanguis egrediens possit egredi.
And if you wish, make the incision wider so that the blood flowing out can flow out. And what must be shed from the blood is 6 ounces and perhaps you will emit more or less from it.Et si pulsus non apparet in locis quibusdam utriusque, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aere quantitative tres digitorum. All of that according to what appears to you from the virute of the sick person and the filling of his artery.
Then consider the wound.
Then if something remains at the bone from the meat, then cut it away so that a hot pustule does not occur; then tie the wound with strips of linen fabric.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ On the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
CHAPTER 3.
When a person has a long-standing headache or acute catarrh due to humidities and acrimonies in the temples, or an old soda with a sharp taste, and similar conditions, and he is treated with various medical methods but it does not help, then we have found that extraction of arteries from the temples or cauterization of them, as we have related.
And the manner of operating on their extraction is that the sick person should shave the hair which is in the temples and stretch it towards the artery which is apparent in the temple.
For indeed it will be apparent to you from its pulse, and rarely hidden except in a few people or by vehemence of coldness.Et sic apposita manu ad arteriam ostenditur, et si non possit apparere, tunc experiri debet cum cauterio, donec apparat.
If it is hidden from you, then let the sick person press his head with any of his garments: then chafe the place with a rough garment.Et sic iterum apponatur ad arteriam ut apparat.
Or steam the spot with hot water until it becomes clear to you. Then take the spatule which I formed a little before. Then peel the skin with it gently until you reach the artery.
Then insert a hook into it and draw it upwards until you have extracted it from the skin and made it emerge from the tunics beneath it on every side.
But if the artery is slender, then enfold it with the tip of the hook.Deinde trahe arteriam versus superiora, donec apparuerit tibi omnem carnem ab ea separata.
Then cut from that part according to the quantity by which its extremities are elongated and contracted, and let there not be any escape of blood.
For if it is not cut and if it is not removed thoroughly, the blood will not rise. Then let there be evacuated from the blood six drachms, up to a scruple.
But if it is a large artery, then one ought to ligature it in two places with double thread, strong, silk: or from the strings of bowels, so that putrefaction does not happen to it before the healing of the wound, and there be any escape of blood.
Then cut away the superfluity which is between two ligatures.Et postea plica oportet ut facias, et obducas eam super placentem de lino, et fune silico, et uestimento lino, et facias eam in locum ueterem, ne properet ad eam putrefactio, et fluxus sanguinis.
Do that in that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a scalpel cautery up to the bone: until its ends are cut and it stays in the same position of that work.
And it is better for the operation, unless if the patient has a fever, or of hot complexion.
Because cautery is from those things which help to end moisture.Et postea trahe linchaminem, et fac ut curantur lachrymae cum aqua rosata, aut cum oleo, donec uenerunt alicuius uiris.
And then pull out the thread, and let them be treated with rose water, or with oil, until they came to a certain man's beard. So it is better for medicine.
And it behooves after the extraction of arteries, that the place be filled with old cooked wine: and put on top of it nicely made lint.Et postea fac ut curentur lachrymae cum aqua rosata, et cum oleo, donec uenerunt ad os.
And after the removal it is to be treated with dry remedies that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
If in the meantime while you are operating there occurs a flow of blood from an artery, then quickly go to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill up the place with lint; and press your hand on it until the blood is stopped.
If you have none of those things at hand, then place your finger over the spot until the blood congeals.
And wash the wound with water of violent coldness, until the keenness is allayed and it is bound up as it ought to be.
And because it is easier and lighter to withdraw the artery by cautery than by excision, it is best to use this cautery having two knives; let the keenness of both knives be equal in hardness to almug.
Nevertheless they are of much less keenness than two knives.
For if they were as sharp as two knives, there would be danger lest both knives should slip and cut the flesh with violence.
With these knives therefore there is a certain thickness which holds the heat of fire and cuts flesh with swiftness; and for this reason it is better than every other work, and lighter and easier.
And let the space between the two knives be a digit's breadth when you have marked two places with hot cautery; and lay both knives down strongly until they reach to the bone and pierce the vein at two places, so that what is between their extremes may be drawn out.
For they are not completely cured by this cautery.Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.
And this is the form of cauterization.
About the treatment of acute and persistent flowing of tears from the eyes.
Chapter IV.
When the tears are persistent and there is a flow from the vessels which are on the exterior of the skull and medicine does not bring relief to them, and you see the face of the patient turning red and feeling a crawling in his forehead, as though ants were crawling, and his eyes are exhausted, moist, so that they have already been corroded by corrosion, and his eyelids are heated by the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients prescribed treatment for them with this operation, and they called this treatment Ense.
And it is, that you instruct the patient to shave the hair which are on his forehead.Et postea facias eum bere vinum calidum ad potestatem suam, et si non possit bere totum, modicum: et si non possit bere vinum, datis ei succo apium, et si non possit bere, infusio apii in aqua calida: postea facias eum dormire.
Then make three cuts in the forehead, equal distances apart according to the length of the forehead; and let the length of each cut be about two finger widths, and that one cut be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second by a little from the movement of the lizards, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries which are in the two sides; and stretch out your hand from the continuation of the two mandibles, and let the space of all the cuts be the amount of three joined fingers: and have ready for you a piece of sponge, or many pieces of dried cloth, with which you will dry up the blood.Et postea cum his ambis secundum formulam medicinae in littera sua, et facias eum dormire aliam noctem.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, whose following shape is.
From the incision which is on the side of the temple to the second incision and strip off with it all the skin which is between the two incisions, along with the sifa, which is above the bone. Then do this also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Then take out this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a blunt-edged knife on one side, sharp on the other.
And this is its shape.Deinde fac ut sit cutis, quae est sub cultellare, super os.
And place the sharp side of it towards the flesh annexed to the skin, and its blunt side towards the bone; and push it in until it reaches the middle split; and cut away with it all the sacs which descend from the head to the eyes; except that it should continue through the incision to what appears of the skin.
Then do this in the middle split up to the other split.Fac illum iterum, per omnes partes, in quibus apparet cutis uersus os: et extrahe ipsum cum cultellare, et impelle in omnem partem: et excoria totam cutem, praeter locum, in quo non possit extendi in lineam rectam.
Do this again in all places where the skin appears towards the bone; and take it out with the knife, and push it into every part: and strip off all the skin, except that place, in which it cannot be stretched in a straight line.And after blood flows in equal quantity, squeeze the places from clotted blood. Then place in every split a bit of cooked wool, and put over them bits moistened with wine, or oil, or vinegar.Et post ea munda omnia cum ligaturebus subtiis: et extrahe ligaturas post duos uiros, vel tres uiginti horas.
And see that no hot pustule occurs.
On the third day loosen the bandage and administer a large draught with lukewarm water.
Then treat it with basilicon ointment and other remedies for wounds until it is healed.
On the cure of acute and catarrhal discharges to the eyes from the interior of the head.
CHAPTER 5.
When anyone has acute catarrh, violent and constant, and you see his eyes wasted, small, and already weakened in their sight; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and the lashes fall out from them, and there is acute pain in the depths of the head, wasting and sneezing ensue: then take from among these accidents, for those materials, and catarrhs do not come except from many veins.
And a better cure for them is this.
And it is, as you command the sick to shave his forehead.Et sapa uiride, et alvum, et uina rubra: et si non possit, faciatur potio cum uino caldo.
Then split one slit in the middle of the forehead, or another little by width, and begin with the slit from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be up to the bone; and lengthen your hand from the wrists of the temples, which move during chewing: until when it is exposed; and dry up all blood with a sponge.Et si in hoc tempore non est exanimum: uade et incide aliam fissuram per longitudinem, quae trahit ad os: donec totum sanguis excidat, et ossa videantur: nam si non exciderunt omnes, sedere apud se corruunt.
And if it is not dead at that time; go and split another slit along its length, which draws to the bone: until all blood goes out and bones are seen: for if they do not all go out, but sit in themselves, they will rot.Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with a cooked old one, or with threads from linen.Et si in ista uiride praesens non est moriens: faciatur alius incisio per longitudinem quod trahit ad os, donec excidat omne sanguis: et ossa videantur, nam si non exciderunt, sedere apud se corruunt.
Then press down from above with bandages; and soak the bandages with wine and oil so that no hot pustule occurs.Et sapa uiride: et exsuge omnia sanguinem: faciuntque omnia haec quae praeceperunt, donec mortis signum uideatur.
And when you open it and see that the cold ulcer has abated, then you must rub the jaw until flesh begins to appear on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that makes the flesh grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of rosin, prepare an ointment from them, and apply it to the place where the flesh is growing on these wounds.
¶ How to treat a wound that has fallen into the ear. Chapter VI.De cure uulceris qui cadit in os. Everything that falls into the ear is one of four species: either a mineral stone, or a stone-like substance such as iron and brass; or it comes from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a fluid, such as water, vinegar, and things similar to them; or it is an animal.
When therefore a stone or a kind of stone which does not grow in the ear falls into the ear, then open up the ear to the sun; if you see the stone, then drop something into the ear from distilled oil or sesamum.
Then you must apply an extraction and cause sneezing with some mild spice, and tickle the nostrils at the moment of sneezing, after you have placed around the ear pieces of cloth or wool, and stretched out the ear towards the upper part.
For it often comes out with this treatment.Omne quod in aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.
If it does not come out, then apply an extraction with the Indian pizigaris which are very subtle; and its form is as follows.
If it comes out with the Indian treatment, that is good.Alioquin, si non egreditur cum Gesti, et cum pizigaroli subtilibus, pone in aurem oulum cum camphora: post quod fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares, ut supra dictum est.
And if it does not come out with the Indian pizigaris and subtle hooks, put into the ear oil with camphor; then cause sneezing as above, and tickle the nostrils. And if it still does not come out, apply an extraction of it with a very subtle blind hook of a few duplications. If it still does not come out through that, then make an air pipe and insert the end of the pipe much into the hole of the ear, and tickle what is in the circle of the pipe with softened wax with oil, so that there is no windy way except the pipe; then extract it with your strong吸引力.Et si uento tuo non egreditur, extrahe cum cannula de aere et oleo. He often goes out with it naked.
But if it will not come out in this manner, take a little of the lime-tree gum or the bird-lime, by which birds are caught, and put it on the end of the probe after you have wrapped a piece of clean linen round it decently; then introduce it into the ear with ease, when you have dried the ear from moisture.
But if it does not come out after all that we have said, then hasten to split it before the hot ulcer or spasm occurs.
And the manner of opening a vein is that you apply leeches feeble at first to the head; and draw from him blood according to the measure of his strength.
Then let the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear towards you upwards; and find a small opening at the root of the ear at the fat in a depressed place; and let the split be like that of the moon till you come to the bone: then draw it out with it, as much as you can, with your instruments.
Then close the opening quickly from your side and tend it till it is healed.
But if it is something which has fallen into the ear from one of the grains, which grow and swell, then see that there is an extraction of it.Et si in aurem cadat uiscum, fac ut egredatur cum eo cotus decens, antequam rixe.
If water has fallen into the ear, see that a probe goes out with it decently before scratching. But if it does not go out to you at once, then take a very thin and fine spatule, after this shape:
And do an extraction of that species from the grains which fall into the ear; and do not do this when you think that it has already been moistened by the vapour of the ear till you put in a probe many times; then draw them out with hooks or a fine pick, or with suction as we have said; for the extraction of them is alleviated.
But when water enters into the ear, it is fitting that the sick person should sneeze with his head inclined at first; and he has already filled his ear with somewhat of cooked old food; and he is lying on that ear, in which there is water.Et si non possit egredi cum eo, quod non debet: tunc extrahe eum cum spatula subita postquam fricabis aurem eius per modum ante dictum.
If therefore it comes out through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of the finger, thin, smooth, and heat them a little with fire, and let the sick person put one of these into the hole of his ear; and spit on one foot from that side, and strike with another stone on the stone which is in the ear.
He shall not cease doing this with the stone and the stone, until all the water comes out.
And now the water comes out like this, that you take a reed or a rush and put one end into his ear; and light the other end with fire until it is burnt mostly.
Then take another rush and do this often until all the water comes out; then pull it out with a cannula as before mentioned about the stone.
But in pulling out of an animal entered into it, if it is small of body like a flea and the like, treat it as I said before.Si autem est magni corporis et ad illum similis cuiusque eorum, et si illum non potes extrahere, sed debet mori, quod intraverit cum ipso, cum ipso moritur et praeteritor est ad omnem rem.
But if it is of a large body which appears to the senses; then manage its extraction with forceps and hooks; and that is easier for all things which are held in the ear.And if it is of a large body, and it cannot be extracted, but it must die as it was entered, then let what went in with it die within, and not come out at all.
But in the extraction of worms bred in the ear when you treat it as we said before about distillation and do not benefit from your treatment; then you should look at the ear in the sun.Et cum lumine et splendore, quae est in aure, utpote si uermis generatus in aurem sit, extrahitur ipse uermis cum ea: si autem non potest extrahi: et est bonum, oportet ut moriatur intra illam.
If therefore something appears there from the intestines, then extract it with tweezers or with fine hooks.
If however nothing appears there, then take a tube, which is of this shape, narrow below and wide above; and insert the slender end into the ear according to the amount that it can bear it: then suck with strong suction.
Do this many times until all the worms come out.
If however they do not obey you to come out, then cover the tip of the tube with a piece of cloth, as I said before concerning the stone.
If however they do not come out with what we have said, then administer distilling remedies which the ancients experienced in worms; and you will find this in a treatise on distillations.Quamuis tamen omnia ista bene facias, non possum te docere, nisi quod ueremum facias ex cera: et illud ponas intrinsecus auriculam: et super eum imponas cannulam ut dixi.
Even though you do all this well, I cannot teach you unless you make a worm out of wax and put it inside the ear; and above it place the tube as I have said.And the way that you pour oil and medicine into the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
As you see make it out of silver or brass, narrow below and with a small hole, wide above.Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicted est hic.
And the way that you pour oil and medicine into the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.Let what pushes up what is in the concavity of the tube be properly made out of brass.
And if you like, take a rod and wrap the end of it with cloth wrapped decently; then pour oil or juice or what you will from these remedies into the tube, and let it be in the ear; then insert the rod from above with the cloth, and squeeze it by hand with moderate compression until that which is within is pushed out: and let that which is poured into the ear be already made warm with fire a little; and beware that what is distilled into it not be very cold, for remedies do not tolerate that.
On the treatment of an accident of auricle.
Chapter 7.
It sometimes happens that children are born from the wombs of their mothers not fully formed.
And it has also happened to some men that they have had an accident in the ear from a wound or from a growth of flesh in it.
And this accident sometimes happens in the depth of the ear-hole, which cannot be reached by touch; and sometimes it happens to the outer part of the hole, and it can be reached by touch.Quilibet ergo medicus qui curat homines a tali opilatione, debet scire de hac parte Auris: et quod ad interiorem foraminem accidit, ut dictum est, et quod ad exteriorem.
That which happens deep within the ear and is not visible is difficult to cure for the most part.
And in that which is touched by the probe, you must put the patient's ear towards the sun and look into it; then if you see an obvious membrane, open it with a thin spatulum, whose shape is as follows, one end of it having a slight breadth, part of which is pointed, and the rest of the spatulum being smooth on both sides, so that it does not harm the ear.
If there is a membrane of flesh growing in the ear passage, then hold it with a thin hook and cut it away gently and energetically until all the meat has been removed.
If there is a membrane in the depth of the ear, then take a thin rod that is smooth and heat it gently with fire; then put it into the ear passage.
If you feel the membrane with it, that is what the sick person feels as a heaviness of the ear, try to open it gently and be careful not to wound the nerves of the ear.
Then put into the ear a piece of lint according to the amount of the breadth of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure that the wound is healed.
Or take lint and soak it in rose water, and sprinkle powdered alkanet on top of it, and use it.
If you see that the ear has started to form a scab, then you must remove the lint and let it stay with another piece of lint which you have wrapped in a ointment made from rose oil until the scab is warm; then treat it until it is healed.
But if there is bleeding, then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and put it over the ear; then use the rest of the treatment that stops the flow of blood as I described above in the chapter on distillation.Si autem uides in profundo auris carnem conglutinatam: et non potes auferre illam, sed uti oleo calido factum per te: fac eum tepidum, et utere ipso.
The cure of eye-lids.
Of the cure of the eye-lids. When a lump happens to the eyelid, sometimes it is moist and sometimes dry.
You must then hold them with tweezers, or with forceps, and cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Then place powdered stibrium over the places.Et si voles cum oleo, aut cum succo de radice malva.
If they ooze blood then cauterize them with a fine lens-shaped cautery.
And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
For they often come back when something remains of their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burnt and do not return.
¶ On the cure of granulations on the eyelid of the eye.
Chapter 9.Antiquiores enim et novi medici de his granulationibus dicunt.
The older and newer doctors speak about these granulations.It often happens that in the eyelids there is something which resembles a pebble in strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called a Pebble: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid, and lower eyelid.Et si non curentur, crescunt et crescunt, donec bene vel male concidant oculum: et multotiens oculus moriatur propter illud.
And if they are not cured, they grow and grow until they strike the eye well or badly: and often the eye dies because of this.The operation on them is therefore to consider then, if there is a Pebble proceeding in that which appears in the eyelid, and move to every part, and its matter is easy.Et si non est Grando procedens alibi, sed procedit e regione oculi cum palpebra, et est prope radicem, ut sit facilis cauterizare illum cum cauterio lenticulari: quia multotiens procedunt grana in palpebris a radice.
And if it is not a Pebble proceeding elsewhere, but proceeding from the eye region with the eyelid, and is near the root, so that it is easy to cauterize it with a lens-shaped cautery: because granulations in the eyelids often proceed from the root.Therefore make a cut over that slit through its width.Et si non possit procedere per latum, sed debet procedere per longitudinem, ut procedat ultra radicem eius, qui est prope omnimodo ad oculum, quia multotiens oculus moriatur propter illum granum.
Then scrape off the scabs from every part of it with ease, until you are successful.
Then hang her up by a hook, and cut her down.
But if the cutting away of it is not prepared for you unless after you have penetrated the eyelid a little with an incision, then it will harm that weak person in some way.
If, however, the fissure is large: then bring it together with a stitch: and tend to it, until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come of it.Si autem omnia in oculis sunt sana et nulla morbus, cum omnes partes eius adtegantur:
But if all parts of the eye are healthy and there is no illness, when everything that has been separated is brought together: a ointment indeed restores it and flesh it out.Quod si quae mensura non convenit oculi eius cum alii, sed omnia bene sunt et nulla morbus in illo:
But if it is not a good fit with the other eye, but all parts are well and there is no illness in it: and if a grain has moved down into the interior of the ear past its superficial surface, then turn over the eyelid, and hang up the grain with a hook; except that you will need an incision, and press it from every part.
But if the eyelid is elongated through an incision, no harm will come of it.Et si quae pars est incisa intra eam, et scissura eius non claudatur:
But if a part within it is cut and its split is not closed: then wash the eye after the incision of the grain with brine; and tend to the place with it that flesh it out, until the sick person heals.Et si oculum non restaurat aqua salsa: tunc inuertite eum cum uirgine lintei, et cura locum cum aqua salina, donec sanetur infirmitas eius:
And if the eye is not restored with brine: then cover it with a virgin linen cloth, and tend to the place with saline water, until its illness is healed;
Chapter 10De axirnath palpebrarum et oculorum, et de curando eorum morbis.
Axirnath is the film that is generated in the upper eyelid: and it indeed happens most often to boys: and it weighs down their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot see the light of the sun because of this, since tears pour into them, and because of this you can see them always lying on their faces, and sleeping on top of them, and their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows, which have already been closed by inflammation: and indeed the prominent Axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the mode of operation of this is that he puts his sick head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare lint in it, and make from that lint a ring according to the amount that is contained by Axirnath from every part.
Then place it on top of it and press with your fingers from all sides so that the Axirnath gathers in the middle of the ring.
Then find in the middle of that moisture with a sharp instrument, slits through its width, and may the slits not be greater than those which are made in phlebotomy in the depths.
Or one must find the skin all around until one reaches the Axirnath for indeed Axirnath proceeds from the slit in many dispositions according to the shape of a white fat lump.
Therefore pull it out with the cloth which you inserted between your fingers to the outside: and you would revolve your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed; and beware lest you add in the slit that you not reach with the instrument to the eye and harm it.Et tu facies illud sicut faciunt clysteres, donec omnino axirnath exuatur: et postea lave oculo cum aqua calida, et unge eum olis et unguento.
If you cannot see the axirrha at the beginning of the fissure, then you add a little into the fissure with ease until it appears.
Then extract it as we have said.
Then immerse some bandages in vinegar and water and apply them to the wound and compress with a powdery poultice.
And some people rub salt and place it into the hollow of the fissure so that what remains from the moisture is liquefied.
Then care for it until it heals.
If however a hot pustule occurs at the site then treat it with mild poultices until it heals.
¶ Of ways of the taxmeer of the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft such that it wrinkles as it ought not.De modo axirrhae in oculis, quae fit per mortem oculorum et per putredinem: quomodo ergo curatur.
Chapter 11.De modo axirrhae in oculis, which is caused by death and rottenness of the eye: how then it is treated.Ataxmir enim oculi est ab excessu humore molli, qui est in oculis et non potest effluere per punctum: quia vero non potest per punctum effluere, rugatur et arescit.
When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond their natural course, underneath the natural hairs, and turn inward: then they harm the eye and cause various illnesses, such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and a white film, until it results in the destruction of the eye.
And indeed the eye is treated for astigmatism in four ways: Or by cauterization with fire.
Or with a sharp instrument, as has been mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.Aut cum medicina plana, que vocatur spatulam.
Or it is cured by making an incision and stitching it up.
Or through tubes, as I will say.
You should place the patient's head in your lap.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If it turns, that is good. Si autem non conuertitur, teneat eam manibus suis et conuertat ad modum quod possit.
And if not: insert the needle into that part of the eyelid where there is an eyelash, and let it pierce the eyelid from above with the thread, and let it be close to the lash itself, that is, close to the edge of the eyelid from which the lashes grow; and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it around the lash.
Then find on the inner part of the eyelid beneath the added lashes, with the incident spatumili from the larger tear duct to the smaller one.
Then pull out the thread, and put a little bit of cotton from an old cloth under the eyelid; then mark on the eyelid with encaustic, in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape should be varied according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid; for it has long been different in men.
For some require that much be cut away from the eyelid according to the amount which is softened by it. Then find with the spatumil above the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller one, and let there be a single split close to the natural lashes, as thick as a hair.
Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then excise it entirely. Then draw together with a thread of fine wool the two lips, with an awl and thread; and wipe away the blood, and cause to adhere that which hangs over the two eyebrows from the threads, with some sticking things, if you wish to make it so; but if not, do not trouble yourself.
Then leave the stitches and threads for three or four days; then care for it afterwards. And if you wish, leave the wound without a stitch, and cure it with that which dries and constricts it.
For the eyelid will be raised up at the site of the wound and its joining; but it will become better.
The ancients taught this method of curing Ataxmir.
However, there is solicitude about the patient, and it comes from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is in Ataxmir as well: And it is to make signs on the eyelid the shape which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Then raise the eyelid with three separated or clustered hooks, according to this shape which follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small tweezers, according to this shape, with equality of incision.
But if it is not possible for you to hold the hook and it does not equal that: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and the other thread near the smaller tear duct: and gather between your fingers the threads with equality.
Then raise your hand with an equal raising: and raise the skin over which the cot was placed, as we have described.Et tene utrumque lachrymale cum digitis tuo pollicis et indicis ad modum quod descripsimus, donec inciso, sicut narrauimus.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture and treat it until it is healed.
But if you cause an abscess to appear where you have made your incision or split the skin, treat that abscess with an ointment and a poultice.
And sometimes it happens that the eyelashes turn inwards too.
Of the cure of Ataxmir with dogs.
AND there is, when you convert the eyelid, and split the fissure which is within, according to what I have narrated.
Then with skill make two reeds or two slender pieces of wood: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and the breadth of them is less than the breadth of a split-stick: and you have already cut into the extreme ends of both on both sides where you hold the thread.
Then bring together both with subtlety above that which overhangs from the eyelid, and tighten both reeds on both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for several days.Postea disciagas cum cannis, et adhaeres locum laceratam cum collodion: et si necesse sit, fac utramque cannam in parte externa palpebrae adhaerens ad oculum, et aliam adhaerens ad narem et super labrum: et sic deambule cum eo usquequaque die quaedam, donec curaretur. Afterwards you will remove it with the reeds, and adhere to the torn place with collodion: and if necessary, make one reed on the outer part of the eyelid adhering to the eye, and another adhering to the nostril and above the lip: and thus walk about with it until each day, until it is cured.For the skin that is tightly stretched will die, and be blackened, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with tweezers.
Then cure it, until it heals.
When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs are not pricked.
And this is the form of two reeds which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
¶ Of the raising of hairs pricking in the eye with a needle.ET faciatur sicut narratum est.
AND it is made as has been narrated.CHAPTER 12.De eleuatione pilorum pungentium oculum cum aqua: et de signis quibus cognoscitur utrum resit vel non.
Operation in it is that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine thread of silk, smoothly.Deinde faciatur sicut antea est dictum de eleuatione pili, donec resit: et sic eleuationem et repulum fit ad libidinosam rem. Then bring together both ends of it and tie them firmly with a fine thread; and let the length of the threads be that of a palm.
Then take another fine thread and pass it beneath, and tie both ends if you wish.
Then let the sick man put his head on your lap, and have him face the sun so that the operation will be revealed; for it is a subtle or minute operation.
Then insert the awl with the thread into the root of the eyelid, and let it penetrate the eyelid speedily until you have drawn out the natural hair.
Then draw the hair up above the thread; and pass the hair through the thread - if it is one, or two, or three, but not more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair emerges from the eyelid with the thread as the natural hair does.
But if the thread is drawn and the hair does not emerge with it, then pull the thread towards the bottom along with the awl which you have made in it until the thread emerges from the upper aperture of the eyelid, and you will see it at the edge of the eye; then draw the thread and the awl, and extract both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh is born over it.
But if the hair is short, then tie to it a long hair from the natural hairs and let it be lifted with that; or leave it until it becomes longer and then lift it up.
The treatment for alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid is as follows:
Chapter 13.
When this alxatrati occurs in the eye it is called Leporina.Si autem accidit in palpebra inferiori, et non possis penetrare cum acum: trahe eam ad superiora, et fac intrare in alinxotati.
And this alxatrati is either natural or accidental.Et si accidit quod non possis penetrare cum acum nec cum alinxotati, sed uides eam in palpebra ut pilum: trahe manum tuam super eam donec egrediatur pilus cum eo: et tene filum ut non extrahas eum.
Accidental wound therefore results from solidifying a wound, or cutting, or cauterizing and suchlike.
And the way of treating it is, that you should find that solidifying, and separate its lips, and put on what is between them a poultice of flax, and tie it up until it heals.
And you ought not to use in the curing of it things which dry and constrict: for if you do so, it will return worse than it was: nay, use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek: and embrocate with water, in which althea has been boiled, linseed: and ointment of dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with one of the oils: and wrap up in it a poultice, and cure it with that.
And your treasure of curing is, to apply all ingeniousness, lest it solidify according to the form which it was at first.
And indeed this operation which we have said is not anything else but a certain rectifying of the hernia, lest it return to the form of the place according as it was altogether. ¶ Of the curing of a hernia which is made in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or drawing up above to the right and left.
Chapter 14.De curatione quae fit in palpebris superioribus et inferioribus.
This is what is truly called the Alxatrati.
And it can be natural or accidental.
Accidental wounds are caused by a cut, a crack, burning or similar.
The method of operating on it is to take a needle with a double thread and thrust it into the flesh and make it pass from the left tear duct to the right until the thread passes through both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide spatula.
If then the shape of the eyelid returns to what it should be, that is good.Et si non redeunt omnia in ordinem suum, tene palpebram superiorem ad inferos cum cerussis et applica super eam cataplasmas calidas.
And if not, hold the upper eyelid down with ceruss and apply hot poultices over it.If not, take a splint and put it in the crack and wind the eyelid around it: find two cracks on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two cracks be from the two corners of the incision so that they meet and form an angle: until when they are brought together they form this shape, and it is a Greek lambda.
Then remove that flesh by as much as its lower acute side is from that which follows the eyelid.Et si in ea uenat umor, et non potest ire per illum angulum, ponito supra eum cataplasmas calidas donec possit ire umor.
Then unite the separated parts with a thread of wool.
Then treat them with the things which we have mentioned concerning soothing medicines and poultices, until they heal.
And if there happens a cut and a wound from an accident, then it is fitting that you find the cut flat beneath the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what was said before.
Then separate between the two lips with poultice, according as we have said.Et quolibet de his quae dicimus faciendum sunt pro tua visu, et experientia, et ingenio.
And all of these things which we say must be done according to your sight and experience and skill.And the sum of what is said about the cure for a cut and wound, when it is above or below, is that you perform in them an operation according to the form of the cut and wound.
For the wound itself is of many diverse forms; and a wise artificer prepares his skill with whatever method is possible for him, until he makes it return to its natural shape or near to it, and the sick person himself, according as suits him from operation and instruments in many dispositions.Et postea oportet ut curet illam secundum quod diximus cum medicinis mollificentibus et liciniis donec conuat et crescit, et faciat se viridem.
And then it is fitting that he should treat it according as we have said with soothing medicines and poultices until it becomes solid and grows and makes itself green.¶ Of the adhesion of the eyelid of the eye to the conjunctiva or the cornea.Et si adhaesit palpebra oculi cum coniunctiva, aut cornea per diuersas causas: tunc oportet ut disciant eam discentibus liciniis et medicinis mollificantibus.
And if the eyelid adheres to the conjunctiva or the cornea through diverse causes, then it is fitting that you loosen it with poultices and soothing medicines.Chapter 15.De cura oculi cum ipse adhaesit palpebrae.
When this solidification happens to many men, in such a way that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye and hinders it from its natural operations.Et hac consolidae praesentia non potest esse pro oculis utilitas: sed si est possibile ut disciat eam discentibus liciniis et medicinis mollificantibus, et faciant eam reddi in modum naturalem vel prope eum, tunc oportet ut curetur.
And this consolidated presence cannot be for the benefit of the eyes; but if it is possible to loosen it with descending poultices and soothing medicines, and make it return to its natural shape or near to it, then it is fitting that it should be cured.You must therefore insert the tip of a probe beneath the eyelid and lift it up; or stretch it with an uncinus; then cut the adhesion with a blunt spatula, one which has not the keenness of the spatulas usually used, but is rather blunt, so that the sick person may not be disturbed by the operation, and the spatula be removed, and the eye injured by its keenness.
Then pour brine into his eye or distill on it from a sieve made with dissolved zinc and water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen thread and place on the eye wool infused with egg white; then after three days use it with solidification until he is cured.
Of the cutting of the nail and of the protuberance of flesh of the lachrymal gland.
Chapter 16.
Know that the nail is in two ways. Or it is neurous and it is like a hard sift, subtle.
Or it is not neurous, like white frozen moisture: which when it touches the iron blade, or you try to catch it with the hook, it is cut off and the hook does not stick to it.
And both kinds do not begin unless from the lachrymal gland greater, until it flows slowly, until it covers the sight and prevents movement and motion of the eye.Et tunc incipies deinde a parte interioris ungue.
And the mode of operation on it is as follows: the sick person should place his head in your lap.
Then open his eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Then pick up the lash with a hook of little curvature, and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle and thread it with horsehair or cow's hair or goat hair; let the thread be strong and the end of the needle slightly bent and fix it in the middle of the lash; then pierce the lash with the needle and tie it up with the thread and extend it upwards. Then, with the hair, scrape off the side of the lash that follows the pupil as if you were squeezing it with the hair all the way to its end.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a very fine spatula or small forceps; and leave the natural tear duct flesh so that no persistent tear flow occurs from its incision.
And sometimes the lash is extended only with a hook, or with thread, as we said above.
Then scrape off with a gentle spatula whose form is like this.
And be careful lest the spatula touch the horny tunic and produce rupture there or perforation of the pupil.
Then after the incision put into the eye something of powdered salt or a wash made from zinc and leave it until another day.
Then treat it as is proper until it heals.Et sic faciamus in oculis quilibet qui habet lachrymas. If the lash is not painful and you cannot put a needle into it or fix a hook on it, then this kind of lash is often treated with medicines and heals as I have described in detail above.
If you wish to cut it, then open the sick person's eye and take a spatula that is thin, gentle, and of low sharpness, according to this form:
Then scrape the lash from above gently with subtlety.Deinde excoria residuum lachrymale cum spatumili secuto.
What if you see that it is rare and broken, and apply to it the ratio, then distill from your hour into the eye of the vinegar made from rosemary, or of red vinegar, or of ground salt: and anoint the eye until another day.
Then repeat over it the operation, until all of it is removed.
Unless it is contrary to you in the eye: then leave it, and heal the pustule, until it heals. Then repeat the operation over it with the ratio, until it heals.
But if the protrusion of the tear gland hurts the eye greatly, it should be suspended with a hook and cut from that part of it: and not finish the incision, so that the tear ducts are not damaged.Postea cura oculum cum oleo roseo per diem et noctem, donec sanetur.
Then drop it in a tear-flask made of copper or tin until healed. Of the incision in Alguardenic and the meat grown in the eye.
Chapter 17.
Sometimes in the eyes of some men, a red meat is born, or is superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or squeezes above the eyelids; and perhaps converts the eyelids to the outside: and it resembles the ball of a rose.
And there is also operation on it, so that he puts his weak head in your lap.
Then open his eyes, and gather all that meat with suitable hooks; and hold it with a pair of forceps, or take it.Et tibi non est dubitandum de pulvere salsae et rosinae, donec cadat.
Then cut the meat first with an incision until it is finished all around with a knife.Et superposita carnis omnia subtrahe, et tene illam cum forcipe, et dehisce utraque parte, et collige, donec cadat tota, et fac eam in unum volumem; et fac iterum incisiones in carne, ut cadant partes superpositionis.
And beware the eye, lest you harm it during the operation; and let your incision be that by which you cut it, or with a spatulum as we have described in the incision of the fingernail, or with small forceps with which the asebel is gathered, according to its shape after this chapter.
When your incision is complete and the entire algardenic is removed, then fill the eye with powdered salt, or with red powder, and the like from corrosive medicines; and place over the eye a bandage of white wool so that it may be secured against hot poultices.
If anything remains of the algardenic, and hot blood prevails over you, and you fear a hot aposteme: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which soothes the aposteme.
Then repeat the operation over it until it is healed.
And likewise do with added flesh which has occurred in the eye from this kind.
However, it is necessary that you abstain from the cure of every weak eye, whether by natural way or by accidental way, operating with iron; and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that this member endures that operation.Et si quaesieris quod sit uia naturalis oculi: haec est, ut incedas per omnes partes eius cum ferro, et intromittas medicamenta corrostiva.
And if you ask what the natural way of the eye is: this is, that you go through all its parts with iron, and apply corrosive medicines.
Chapter 18.De collectione Sebel ex oculo. There are red veins which are woven over the eye and prevent the eye from seeing its work; and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
So it is necessary for you to consider first if the eye in which there is a Sebel is strong and there is no sickness in it excepting the Sebel; then collect its Sebel.
And it is good to instruct the weak man to put his head on your lap.
Then cut those veins with a hook or two according to your skill; let the hook be very fine and have a double point, in this way, or let there be two hooks going into the body on one stalk, in this way.Et postea, ut vidisti sanguinem efflusum, et uenae ad se redactas: captiuus tibi erunt.
Then after you have seen the blood flow and the veins return to themselves, let them be caught for you. Then with very fine tweezers gather up those veins with care and wipe away the blood from time to time until you see the veins drawn back from the eye and dissolved; and beware of hurting the eye with the points of the tweezers.Et postea oculus redibit in statum suum, et uidebit sicut antea.
And be your operation in the midst of the day before the sun, and you are to be steadfast in your operation indeed, so that you cut not those veins.
And when you have plucked it out, then distill into the eye either verdigris or red ochre, so that with its acuteness it may corrode what remains of the graving.
But if you are not able to draw out the whole of it at that time, then plaster the eye with that which allays the pain of the eye; and leave it for several days, until the pain of it is stayed: and let it be secured from a hot pustule: then repeat over it in the same manner again, until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps.
Of the reduction of the nose to its place.
CHAPTER XIX.
Physicians call Arissata a pipe, which they cure with a cautery, or with an acute medicine burning, according to the nature of what precedes it.
And if it is not healed, then there is no nature in it, unless you should feel upon the pustule at its birth-place, and draw out all the moisture which is within it, and the pus, until the bone is uncovered.¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.
With regard to the reduction of the nose to its place. When therefore the bone is uncovered, and you see in it a putrefaction, or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is thus:
And it is called the scraper of the head.
Let it be made out of Indian iron, and let its head be round like a pin, which has on its point the mark of a file, or the mark of an aliskilfer with a subtle point; and place it over the corrupte bone.¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum. Then revolve it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little, until you know that the putrefaction is now scraped; and do this often.¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.
Then revolve it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little, until you know that the putrefaction is now scraped; and do this often.¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum. Then restore the place with astringent drying medicines.Et nominant medici haec Fistulam, quod non potest reduci ad locum suum nisi per cauterium aut per medicine acuta: et fac illam postea cum medicina melle et theriaque.
If therefore the part is healed and flesh grows on it and the course of the sickness is cut off and it remains for forty days and does not become unhealed again and there is no suppuration and no accident befalls it, then you may know that it is already healed.
And if not, then there is no aptitude in it unless one reduces the fistula to a nasal opening according to this form.
And it is, that you may detect from the bone with iron, or with an acute medicine; and when the bone is detected, then take a drill according to this form, its extremity is of iron, triangular: and its wood is of a pyramid thinned out to its extremity, as you see.
Then put that over the bone itself; and let it be near the tear duct: and lengthen your hand a little from the eye.
Then revolve your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone and feels the weakness; through that when he finds the wind to go out from him when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with astringent and drying medicines as I have taught you.
When therefore flesh grows and the place is hardened; then the matter which was poured out to the outside returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter over the sick man.
Of the Reduction of a Protruberance in the Eye. CHAPTER 20.
When the Eye protrudes with its whole, and there is no harm or diminution in sight; then you ought to heal the sick man: then bleed him: afterwards put bleeding cups on his neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then put over the Eye a liniment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and mastic.Et si post haec non renouatur, sed permanet: tunc ponas super eum vestem quae tegit locum oculi totum, et facias, ut oculus in ea continer: donec ueniat ad aliam mensem.
Then press the eye from above onto the ointment with many pieces of wadding.
And the manner of the wadding is as follows: Take soft cloths, many in number, and fold every cloth out of these over double four times; make many out of them: then place them one on top of another according to the quantity which the eye requires: then press hard onto them with a strong bandage.
And repeat the blistering with suction without scarification.
Then remove the blisters and leave the eye bound day and night.Et in diebus uel utrique die, secundum quod tibi placet, fac de puluillis uentosas intra oculum, et stringe Oculum, sicut dictum est: fac autem omnem dies, donec puluis intra oculum non demittat, vel donec oculus placeat.
If the eye becomes soft again, then it is necessary to press hard again; then remove the bandage after a day and night as we have said. If, however, the eye has not been healed by this time, then repeat the blistering within the eye with wadding and press on the eye as already said; do this every other day until the eye is healed or until you are satisfied.
If you see that the film of the eyeball has returned, all is well and if not then repeat the ointment and wadding, and the bandage and blistering until the eye is healed.
Of the incision of the film of the eyeball:Et si ergo uides eandem tunicam dissecatam et lacrimans, accipies puluillos, et facies eorum super emplastrum multum, ut dictum est; deinde stringes oculum cum puluillis multo cum puluis intra oculum: fac hanc stringentiam duram per quattuor et viginti horas.
Chapter 21.
When the disruption takes place in the white of the eye, and a lump appears on the outside of the eyelids like the head of a grain of wheat, and the person's appearance is spoiled because of it, and he wishes to have it removed: then there is an operation for this, which I will describe. One introduces a needle into the root of the lump from below, upward toward the top.
Then introduce another needle which has a doubled thread attached to it through the part which produces tears, and make it penetrate, and leave the first needle in place according to its position.
Then cut the loop of the doubled thread, and tie it tightly around the lump all around the needle, and tighten it greatly.
Then withdraw the needle and place on the eye a piece of wool soaked in white vitriol, and leave it until the thread falls out with the lump.
Then treat the eye with this, which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes if the lump is being pressed from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye becomes very prominent, then it must be cut and made smaller.
Then it must be pierced with a very fine chisel, so that it penetrates deeply into the eye, and let the white of the eye flow and go down, and enter in at once; then tighten it until it is healed.
¶ Of the cure of Algomenon.Et quandoque faciatur granum super oculum cum rubrice et tenui cuticula: et si non possit remisi, curat eum cum aqua calida, donec cadat: et fac in oculum unctionem olei et albugini, et ponito super oculum.
Chapter 22.Et quandoque faciatur granum super oculum cum rubrice et tenui cuticula: et si non possit remisi, curat eum cum aqua calida, donec cadat: et fac in oculum unctionem olei et albugini, et ponito super oculum.
This ailment which is called Algomenon, is nothing else but an inflammation which collects in the eye like a descending water, and is not itself.Et quandoque fit granum super oculum cum rubrice et tenui cuticula: et si non possit remisi, curat eum cum aqua calida, donec cadat: et fac in oculum unctionem olei et albugini, et ponito super oculum.
And the manner of operating on it is, to make the invalid sit on a seat which has been prepared and raised.Et facito eum inclinare caput ad pedes: et tene tu manum ad oculum, donec inueyas in oculum cum spatulo subile, quod est ad ligaturam oculi.
Then take hold of his head in both your hands and move it until you see him regain consciousness and look at you.
Then it is pressed and does not come out, and the light is restored: and the sick person sees things as he used to see them; and if it does not come out below, you know that there is water in it.
If the sick person does not regain consciousness with what we have said, then make him sit between your hands. Then take a thin spatulum and feel around with it above the horny membrane a little at the edge of the junction of the cornea with the conjunctiva, until the pus comes out.
When it comes out, then drop into the eye some warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fennel and honey; then treat him with the rest of the treatment until he recovers.
¶ On the treatment of water which has entered the eye, or of a cataract.Si autem non possit evacuare per uerticem oculi suus lacrimas: et diuersas uoluntas habuerit, et non potest uisionem facere bene: sed facit rictum oculi uel uirticem, quia est in oculis aqua.
If he cannot shed tears from the corner of his eye, and has lost his vision, and can see badly, and makes a squint with his eye, because there is water in it.Chapter 23.
I am going to describe to you the types of water in division, and what is suitable for boring, by speech explaining and displaying, then accept that very thing according to health.
Then therefore you must make the sick person sit between your hands in a square position, opposite to light, near the sun: and tie his sound eye, and tighten it strongly: then with your right hand the eyelid of his eye, if the eye in which is water, is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then take with your right hand alum, if the eye is the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then put the end of the alum near to the crown by thickness of the ray in itself the whiteness of the eye appearing watery minor: then push the alum with strength: and you would revolve with it your hand, until it penetrates into the whiteness of the eye: and feel, that the alum already reached to the thing hollow.
And it is necessary, that the measure of the journey of the alum to depth, the measure of the space which is from the pupil until the end of blackness: and it is the crown of the eye.
Indeed you will see them in the very pupil's vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the membrane of the cornea.Et quia pupilla per se non habet sensum uisionis, sed per albuginem, siquidem albugines ex coelula oculi pernicies, illa quoque per se uisionem habere non potest: et propter hoc oportet ut almagda per albedinem trahatur usque ad pupillam: nam si traheris almagdam usque ad coronam, et non percutieris albuginem, non facies ulla uisione.
Then place alum until the place where there is water.
Then squeeze it below one after another.
If then the water comes down immediately, then the sick person sees that which is above him immediately, and the alum in his eye.
Then rest a little while.
If then the water comes down, then put it aside a second time, except that alum comes out.
When then it is pressed, and does not come up: then take out the alum with ease: and you roll your hand slowly.Deinde uolue illum super caput infirmi, ut possit egredi almagda in oculis. Then dissolve in water some of the clear salt of宝石：and wash with it the eye inside out.
Then put outside the eye all lint，or wool steeped in rose oil, and white egg: and bind it with that sound eye.Item ponat super caput infirmum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, ut ante dictum est: et liga oculum cum eo.
We, and those of our time, place over it ground cumin mixed with white of egg.
If the almagda does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is of man and his eye is very hard, then one must take an eye-spoon called Alberid whose form is this:
Pass through with it the conjuctiva only and not your hand to the foramen; and it is not except that you make a path to the almagda a subtle place.
Then introduce the almagda according to what we have said.
And at the end of your work a bed must be prepared properly for the sick man in a dark room where he will sleep on his back in a dark house and from all movement and coughing and his food should be that with which nature is soothed and he should not move his head to the right or left.
And the bandage be according to its arrangement until the third day. Then release it in that dark house and test his sight and let him see things.
Then return the bandage to its original arrangement until the seventh day.
And one must not do that at the time of curing or immediately after cutting but rather move it away because water rises rapidly through a wound that is facing upward.Et faciamus ligaturas per foramen usque ad diem septimum: et post septimos dies, si non obeat tibi in uisum, quia multum est de eo quod obeo.
If a hot pustule has occurred, then it is necessary that you treat the eye before the seventh day and correct it with that which soothes the pustule until it is soothed; then remove its bandage and put over his face an oral bandage by means of which his sight will be regulated during several days, while he remains in that dark room.
Then he must leave the house little by little and move about in his rooms.
And you should know that in winter the disciple is not excused from frequent bandaging; then indeed he dares to go beyond the surgery.
And indeed one of those from Al-Arah has already arrived with us who said that there was a perforation made in the Al-Arah magdan, through which water is sucked up.Et qui facit istum magdam perfore faciat eum prope oculum: et postea faciat illum per se et cum oleo et manna et cerussae et camphorae et balsamorum unctione et caryophylleis et myrrhae et theriacis et salis armeniaci.
But indeed I have not seen anyone in our land who has done that; nor have I read it in any ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.Et qui facit istum magdam perfore faciat eum prope oculum: et postea faciat illum per se et cum oleo et manna et cerussae et camphorae et balsamorum unctione et caryophylleis et myrrhae et theriacis et salis armeniaci.
And these are the forms of species from the magda, so that one who is ignorant of them may stand upon it.And he said: it must be cut open; and let him be rubbed with salt in the place where it has been cut; and then let him be bound up tightly until he passes away.
Let them be made out of their own metal; and the ends of them must be triangular with this same subtlety, and the end acute.And he said: it is necessary that there be two holes in each of them, through which air will pass from outside to inside, so that it may pass over his face, while he wears the device, until his sight has been regulated; then let him remove the device.
Forms of the magda.And he said: you must not open it except when you have a pustule on your eye; and you open it over boiling water; then take the mixture and spread it over the eye, until the pustule has been soothed; then open it again and close it up again over the eye.
¶ Of the treatment of a birthmark on the nose.And he said: you must make two holes in each of them, through which air will pass from outside to inside, while the person wears the device; and that air will pass over his face until his sight has been regulated; then let him remove the device.Et qui facit istum magdam perfore faciat eum prope oculum: et postea faciat illum per se et cum oleo et manna et cerussae et camphorae et balsamorum unctione et caryophylleis et myrrhae et theriacis et salis armeniaci.
Chapter XXIV.
Chapter XXIV. When diverse substances are added to the nose, sometimes there grow therefrom meats of a scorpion-like shape with many feet; and therefrom is a fleshy substance like a stone of dusky hue; and therefrom also grows a soft meat not of dusky hue.
Therefore, on the soft and not fraudulent and non-cancerous substance which grows from these meats, let the sick man be seated facing towards the sun, and open his nostrils, and insert the hook into those meats; then draw them out outwards and cut away whatever you have grasped with a very thin and acute spatulum on one side, until you know that all the flesh is removed.
But if anything remain of it from which separation is not possible, then scrape that with one of the thin instruments with ease until nothing remains of it.Quod si autem carnes quae nascuntur in naso essent firmiores et duriores: tunc oportet ut debilescascantur per plerumque cum aquis calidis vel luis, donec possint facilius separari.
But if the meats growing in the nose are stiffer and harder, then they should be made soft by frequent applications of hot water or a poultice until they can be separated with ease. But if blood flows profusely or there is an ulcer, then apply to it what is appropriate; or if there are malignant sores, then cauterize them quickly until the blood stops and all the meats are removed.
Then vinegar, water or wine should be poured into the nose after making an incision.Et si per dies quosdam sanguis non desisteret fluere: tunc oportet ut cauterizet nasum ut supra dictum est, donec sanguis desistat fluere.
If the nose opens and moisture runs out onto the palate then you know that it is healed.
If moisture does not penetrate as it should then you know that there is flesh born inside the upper bones of the nose to which the instrument did not reach with its incision.
Then you must insert a flaxen thread which has some thickness to it, and tie many knots in it; and place between each knot the amount of a finger, or less: and let the sick person send the one end of the thread into his nose with a stick, or with whatever he can after he has made it similar to an azer: and he must draw out his own smelly stuff, until it reaches as far as his brain, and comes out above his throat.
And many a time the Atomi boys do this same thing at school; and it is an easy matter for him who wants to.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one which goes out above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Then tie a knot in the meat with the knots which are in the thread. Do this until you know that the meats are tied up with the knots of the thread.Postea trahe filum, et omnia ex naso egredientur: et non facias aliam incisionem.
Then pull out the thread and after wiping away the blood put into the nose the liniment you have moistened with Egyptian ointment; let it remain for three days or more until all that remains of the flesh is eaten away by the ointment.
Then put a lead pipe into the end of the nose for several days until it is healed.
If however it needs something to dry it out, use that remedy.
To make a head-purging instrument with which oils and other medicines are dripped into the nose, make it out of silver or brass so that it is like a small lamp open like a seashell, and its spout similarly.
And if you wish to make the pipe closed, as though a reed,
And the hollow of this instrument for head-purging, make it hollow, exposed: and let it have a handle at its end which you can hold when you heat oil or something else in it that is flowing out.
This is the shape of the instrument. ¶ Of the cure of the nose-bleed.
Chapter 25.
Many times a boil is born at the tip of the nose and grows bigger and bigger with days until its appearance becomes foul.And it happens that it comes from some wound in the nose, or from some ulcer, or from some ulcerous growth; sometimes also from some ulcerated tooth, sometimes from the eye, sometimes from the ears, and sometimes from a boil on the forehead.And it can happen that it comes from some ulcerated sinus between the eyes.
And therefore one ought to cut off its head at the beginning of its appearance and eradicate all of it.For if you allow it to come to a boil, it is not possible to eradicate it except with difficulty.And so in the beginning you ought to cut it off by the root, and then to treat it as follows: first you should take a small pair of forceps whose tips are bent back at an angle to meet one another, and also a small pair of scissors whose points are similarly curved.Now put them both into the boil; hold them tightly, and with a sharp knife cut off its head, and then take out all of it with the forceps.
Then put cautery or burning medicine over the place where you took it out.And if you wish to apply a cautery, do so by means of some strong iron; or else take some red-hot embers and put them on the spot.Or else take some medicine that burns like an ointment made from the juice of mallows and rose leaves mixed with vinegar in which you can also add some green bronze, or a little bit of quicksilver, or honey.Now put it in the hole after taking out all the boil; let it remain until the hole is closed up by this medicine.And as soon as you have taken out the boil with the forceps, wash the wound well with water and vinegar; then apply an ointment made from rose oil and mallow juice, and a little honey and green bronze, or else some quicksilver.And if the wound in the nose is large enough to take the end of the forceps, do as follows: first put on the cautery as described above, then close up the entrance of the sinus with some strong iron.Now apply the ointment, and keep applying it until the entrance is closed up by this ointment.And if you cannot close up the entrance, take some small pieces of wool and dip them in an ointment made from rose oil or mallow juice; then put them into the entrance of the wound, and let them remain there for a short time to stop up the entrance until it is closed by itself.Now apply the ointment again, and keep applying it regularly so that it does not open up again.And if some pus still remains in the wound, and you do not wish to have it come out by itself, then take some wool which has been dipped in an ointment made from mallow juice, rose oil or quicksilver; put this in the entrance of the sinus so that it blocks the passage until it is closed up.And if this does not work well for you, take a little piece of sponge and soak it in rose oil, then put some red-hot embers on top of the wound and apply pressure with the hand; hold the sponge there tightly until it is cauterized.
If therefore the incision is delayed until it has become magnified, then consider whether it is stony, hard, of a dusky color and insensible: then do not touch it with iron; for the ulcer is cancrous.
For many a time I have seen one who cut an ulcer on himself, and great harm resulted to him who had it.
And if the ulcer is soft to the touch, not dusky colored, and you see that incision is possible in all of it, then evacuate the unhealthy matter, and cut it without fear or hesitation; and treat the place with something that dries and constricts until it is healed.
¶ Of the sewing up of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Chapter XXVI.De sutura nasi.
You should know that when there is a separation of continuity in one of these cartilage pieces, the operation has little effect, except in some people.
Therefore, when something happens to someone, you should consider whether the wound is fresh and bleeding. Then put together the lips of the wound with a stitch, then take care of it until it heals.
And if the lips of the separation of continuity are already separated and each part is healthy, then you should cut away all the skin that is exposed until it bleeds.
Then bring together the two lips with a stitch, and tighten it, and powder over it dragon blood and ground olibanum, and put on top of the powders a piece of diaphoretic plaster, and one of the other plasters that harden. Then leave it bound for two or three days.
Then loosen it, and change the medicine, and leave it until the threads come away by themselves.Et si ex his filis aliquid moriatur, et non possit per se abscidi: tunc tene eum, et trahe filum usque ad ultimum, ne remanserunt alia fila in carne. And if anything dies from these threads and cannot be cut away by itself, then hold it and pull the thread to the very end so that no other threads remain in the flesh. Then take care of it with ointment until it heals.
Now the manner of stitching is to bring together the separation of continuity, either with awls as we described in the suturing of the belly, or bring the separation together with thread as I have made you know.Et si ex uulnus est in carnibus multum, non oportet te uti cum sutura: sed potius oportet te curare eum cum unguento, donec sanetur: et postea fac ut excidatur.
On the extraction of lip bumps.
Of the extraction of the bumps on the lips. Many men are indeed troubled with hard bumps inside their lips, some smaller and some larger.Et huius modii placentium non omnes est extractio facienda sed tan[d]um eorum quae multum offendi[n]t vel quae magnam habent in[fl]am[m]ationem et dolorem: nam[que] alicui[s] place[n]t et dolere[n]t sub[i]gito[n]e s[i]t[u] et virescunt[.]
Therefore it is necessary to turn the lip over, and find over each of its bumps, and lift it up with a hook, and cut into it from every side.Et postea facias super eum ligaturam et fias in ea sal[t]e et oleo et p[ar]afina: et post multos dies remitte[s] ligaturam et finde[s] quod nodus sit m[a]gnum[.]
Then you fill the wound after cutting with powdered pepper until the blood is cut off.
Then it is cauterized with vinegar and healed with that with which there is astringency until the wounds heal.
Of the cutting of flesh born above the gums:
CHAPTER XXVIII. Many times a growth of flesh is born above the gums which the ancients call an epulis.
It is therefore necessary that you hang it up with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root and let the pus flow out or the blood.
Then put over the wound powdered pepper or other astringent powders that are drying.
If the growth returns after treatment, for it often returns, then cut it again and cauterize it; for it will not return after cautery.
Of the reason of cutting Teeth with a iron:
CHAPTER XXIX.
Sometimes they grow on the surfaces of teeth from within and without, and between the gums there are rough, foul-smelling cortices, and sometimes they become discolored and greenish, and the corruption reaches the gum through them, and the teeth become foul because of it.
It is therefore necessary that you have the patient sit between your hands and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth where there appear to you cortices like sand; until nothing remains of them, and similarly do with blackness and greenness and yellowness and other things until they are cleansed.
If then what is in them is removed at the beginning of the reason, that is good; and if not, then make a second scraping on another day, and a third, until at last the intent reaches the one you are looking at.
And know that the tooth needs scrapers of diverse forms, many figures; according to how it is prepared for your operation; because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from below is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.Et scias quod dentum quandoque indigit tritu, quandoque etiam cauterio, secundum quod apparet tibi.
And these forms of razors be prepared with you, such as you see.
Of drawing out the pain of teeth.
CHAPTER 30.
It behooveth that thou cure the tooth of its pain with every art, and tarry not in pulling it out.
There is no profit of his tooth when it is pulled out, forasmuch as it is a substance very fine: until such time as there be an occasion of pulling it out, then it behoveth the feeble man to pull it out, that he may be strengthened, and certified with thee of the aching tooth.Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.
The pain oft deceiveth the feeble man and thinketh that there is a ulceration in the tooth, and he pull it out: then doth not the pain depart until such time as the feeble tooth be pulled out.And these forms of razors be prepared with you, such as you see.
For we have seen this by the experience of phlebotomists.Et quod dictum est de rasorio, et de dentibus: idem dicitur et de alio quolibet dolore corporis humani.
When therefore you find a tooth aching of itself, then you must make incisions around the tooth with a spatular instrument having some strength, until the gum is loosened on all sides; then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps at first gently, until you shake it.
Then put into the tooth large forceps in good position, and lay the head of the patient between your knees; hold him well so that he may not move; then draw out the tooth straight, so as not to break it.
If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under the tooth on all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.Si tamen non potes egrediri facere, sed dolorem solvere tantum, tunc caput infirmi in primis positione bona subtege: deinde intromitte aliquod instrumenti, et conare facere loca per omnia quae invenies intra gingiuiam: postea agitare dentem cum forcipibus magnis intra gingiuiam usque ad radices.
If the tooth is perforated or hollowed out, then you must fill that cavity with a piece of cloth; and tie it with the end of a thin cord so as not to break when you pull on it with forceps.
You must also make many incisions around the gum all around very carefully.
And beware of breaking it, and let a part of it remain and return upon the patient from that evil which is greater than his first pain.
And beware of doing what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste and audacity in regard to extraction beyond what we have described.Et si per casum facias laciniam in gingiua, et non facias scarificationem cum spatulo: tunc postea intra illam gingiuiam, quo dens eruitur, invenies sanguinem coagulatum: quod ut soluas, oportet ut facias laciniae intra radices dentis scarificatio.
Often, great infirmities come upon men, whose more difficult parts are broken, and all or some of their roots remain, or so that they extract it with some bones of the jaw, as we have often witnessed. Then let it be healed after its extraction with wine, or vinegar and salt. If there is a flow of blood from the place (for this often happens), then grind some aloes, and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the aloes does not help.
The forceps by which the tooth is moved at first should be of long handles, with short, thick tweezers, so that when you press it on the tooth they do not double up on themselves; they should be as you see the tweezers for thick hairs, until when you squeeze them with them, they do not bend themselves or double up; of short handles, and they should be made of Indian iron, or good bronze, straight-edged; and in their edges there should be teeth, some of which enter into others, and squeeze with a decent grip.
And sometimes the ends are made like the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are of strong grip.
Of the extraction of teeth, and of the breaking out of the bones of the lower jaw.
Chapter 31.
When something remains after the breaking of a tooth, then it is necessary that you put on the place a poultice with butter for one day or two days, until the place softens; then insert into it tongs, or forceps: whose edges are like the beak of a bird called a stork.
But this is the form of the forceps.
Let their edges be made like a file, or like an alisky.Figura autem haec est eorum:
If it does not give way to you at the exit with these forceps, then you must, as above on the root, and uncover all of the flesh, and introduce the tool which is named palanca parua, whose form is this.
It is short at the end, slightly thick: and it must not be soaked, so that it does not break.
If the root then goes out through it, it is good; and if not, one must command with these other tools whose forms are these.
The form of the first is triangular at the end, in which there is a certain thickness.
The form of the triangular thin end.
It is also commanded with this tool having two branches, whose form is this. And with other tools and instruments which preceded in the treatment of teeth.
It is also a command with this tool which is like a large hook, whose form is this, of a twisted triangular end, in which there is something of thickness, so that it does not break; and it must not be soaked.Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.
And you should know that there are many tools of the teeth; and likewise other tools are not counted, and a cunning artificer, subtle in his art, finds by himself an instrument, according to what operations and illnesses indicate to him.
Because there are diseases for which the ancients did not say there was an instrument, because of the diversity of their species.
But if a bone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then examine it on itself in its place with that which suits it from the tools and forceps of which I spoke in the extraction of roots, and command with gesti, whose form is this.
Let there be something of thickness in it little by little, so that it may be bound, or held with it the bone, and not escape and slip, until the bone goes out; and restore the place with convenient medicines for it.Quamvis autem uoluntatem faciat urina, si non est ambiguita inter dentem et radicem: tunc iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis qui nominantur ligules, quae tenent dentem intra radices ut teneat in loco suo, et faciant ut non movatur nec frangatur, cuius forma est haec.
If there is a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape away the rottenness and treat it until it heals.
On the locking of prominent teeth above others
Chapter 32.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, a bad shape results from it; and especially when it happens in women, and girls, that is, the beautiful ones.
For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and is not set in place, nor can its locking be performed, nor can it be filed; then uproot it. And if it is joined with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, of which this is the shape.
It is like a small beak, and is made from hard iron, very acute at its end.
And let your cutting be over many days, because of the hardness of the tooth and so that it will not move any of the other teeth.
But if it is protruding exposed to its filing: then file it with a file of hard iron, of which the shape is thus.
Let it be all of hard iron, and its handle minute points very small, like a file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that the tooth will not be moved and fall out; then smooth it, at last scrape it with some razors.
If there is a tooth from which a part breaks off and injures the tongue; then it must be filed also, until the roughness of that breaking-off is taken away, levelled out, and not injure the tongue or spoil speech.
¶ On the twisting of teeth with gold wires.Et si dens est retortus, et emersit super alios: oportet ut adducatur ad locum suum naturalem per limaturas, donec possit serrare contra dentem, de qua loquimus superius: et si non potest serrare, cum filis auri torquetur.
Chapter 33.
When the front teeth are knocked and shaken by a blow or an accident, and the feeble person cannot hold firm over what he eats so that it does not fall out; and you have treated them with astringent remedies, but the treatment has not helped: then there is a remedy to tighten them with a gold thread. For silver turns green, and putrefies after some days, but gold is never changed.
And let the thread be mid-fine in thickness and coarseness according to the quantity that it can hold between the teeth.
And indeed the shape of the retation is that you take a thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then you weave with both ends of the thread among the shaken teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the needle to the healthy tooth on the other side.Et postea trahas tela in modum laqueationis usque ad dentem alterius partis: et sic facias per omnes dentes quos vis retare.
Then draw out the thread to its full extent, up to the point where you began; and press your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it does not move at all; and let your pressure be such that when you draw the thread, it will not slip from the roots of the teeth.
Then cut off the projecting ends of the thread with tweezers; and tie both threads together, and twist them around the teeth, so that they are concealed between the sound tooth and the movable one, without hurting the tongue; then the thread may be left in its place until it is drawn out.
If however it be cut or slip, tie them with another thread and keep it in place for the whole time.
And this is the shape of teeth, and the figure of the rotation of two sound teeth, and of two movable ones, as thou seest.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after a fall, and are retained as we have said, and remain; but this does not happen except through the skill of an artist who is wise and experienced.Et utrumque faciunt, qui saepe experientiam in his habuerunt, et qui saepe remedia ista operantur, utpote quod multum laboris et rationis quaerit.
And a suitable piece of bone is sometimes prepared, and formed into the shape of a tooth, and put in its place to strengthen the tooth, and pressed there as we have said; and it remains, and serves for a long time.
¶ Of the cutting of the ligament which occurs beneath the tongue, and hinders speech.Et quandoque fit, ut ligamen quod sub lingua est, per casum aliquem incidiatur, vel laceret: et praecipue facit hoc, cum res debita loquendo, vel comede, vel bibendo, vel ridendo, vel dormiendo.
Chapter 34.
If there is something hard and knotted there that comes from a healed wound, then insert a hook into it and explore its length until you cut the ligament and the knot is released.Et si fuisset in illo quoddam lacerum et adhaerens ad linguam: tunc incide illum per longitudinem, donec soluatur adhaerentia, vel subtrahe illum cum eleuata lingua.
If, however, there is a flow of blood, then apply pounded alum to the spot. If, however, you are overwhelmed by the blood, then cauterize the spot with a lentigo cautery appropriate to it; then treat it with the rest of your treatment until it heals. The extraction of a ranula under the tongue.
CHAPTER 35.
It sometimes happens that an abscess forms under the tongue resembling a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural functions, and perhaps even growing so large as to fill the mouth.
If therefore you see it dark-colored, or black, hard, and not finding it feeble to the touch, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it has declined toward whiteness, in which there is moisture, then throw a hook into it and cut it with a subtle spatulum and free it from every part.
If blood overcomes you in the hour of your operation, then put crushed zega on it until the blood is stanched: then return to your operation until you have taken it out with its complement.Quod si non potes omnino peruincire uterum, nisi partem facias carnis, sicut dixi tibi; quomodo ergo uides quod intrauitur in carnem, et est ad modum calli, et paulo post discedit: tunc extrae carnem circa ipsum cum coltello, donec liberes omnem partem uteri.
If you cannot at all pierce the uterus except that you make a flesh-wound as I said to you; how then do you see that it intrudes into the flesh and is like a callus, and soon after it separates: then cut out the flesh around it with a knife until you have freed every part of the uterus.Then cauterize it with vinegar and salt, and attend to it with the rest of its cure according as is suitable for it until it is healed.
¶ Of the cure of an apzemata of the two tonsils.In primo quoque die, in quo intrauitur in carnem, non tange, nec ad modum decliviationis trahat, ne si facit sanguinem uenam, quod est periculum, quia propter eam sanguinem uenanem mortuos multos uidem.
Head XXXVI.De curatione apostematis tonsillae.
Then either pierce it or it will burst by itself.Si tamen est post tonsillam in locis subglandularibus, et est dolens et pulsat:
And if it is after the tonsil in glandular places, and it hurts and pulsates:And if it is white coloured, round, and its root is slender: then one ought to cut into it.Et postea fiet resecatio radicis cum ferro ut supra.
And the operation upon it is, that you consider before his operation, if the aposteme be grown cool and quiet, or diminisheth somewhat: then let the sicke man sit in a weake manner before the Sonne, and his head lye in thy lap, and open his mouth, and let the servant take him betweene his hands, and presse his tongue downward with this instrument, which hath this forme. Let it be made of silver or brass, as thin as a knife-blade.
When therefore thou pressest it with the hooke, and the aposteme appeareth unto thee, and falleth upon thy sight: then take a crooke, and fix it in the amigdalum, and draw it out to the outside as farre as thou canst, saving that thou pull with it somewhat of the tunicks.
Then cut it with an instrument, of what forme followeth:
It is like to tweezers: howbeit the ends of it are crook'd, so that the hole of either of them is opposite to the point of the other: wherefore let it be of Indian iron, or steel, wet with alfue.Quam primum ergo incideris apostemam, et non cadat in eam tuus uisi, sed adhaererit ad tunicas, iterum preme linguam cum eo, et sublime trahe: sed cave ne frangas alicuium eorum tunicas: nam si quaeris uti instrumentis ferri, ueluti cultello, aut scalpelis, ita quod possas incide ad medullam: non est necesse.
As soone as thou hast cut the aposteme, and it fall not into thy sight, but adhereeth to the tunicks, press the tongue again with that instrument, and draw it gently forth: howbeit take heed that thou breake not any of the tunicks: for if thou wilt use iron instruments, as a knife or scalpel, that thou mayest cut to the pith, it is not needfull.But if that instrument be not present, then cut it with a spatula, of what forme followeth.
Let it be sharpe on one side, but not sharpe on the other side.Et habebis aliam laminam, cuius haec est forma:
And thou shalt have another plate, of what forme followeth:And after thou hast cut one amigdalum, cut the other according to this same manner of cutting.
Then after the cutting, let the sicke man gargarize with colde water, or with vinegar and water.Et postea per totum diem et noctem, donec sint incisiones consuntae: ut queit prostratus, nec movens caput suum.
If however blood flow should occur, gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled; or leaves of myrtle, and similar astringent substances, until the flow of blood is stanched; then tend to the wound until it heals.
And sometimes other abscesses develop in the throat other than the two tonsils.
Therefore cut into these also as I said in cutting into the two tonsils equally.Quamvis autem superius sit in gutture apostema, incide etiam superius; et si infra sit, incide etiam infra: sed non profundum ne ad os tangas.
And indeed I have already treated a woman from an abscess that had grown between her throat, which was drawing pus, few senses, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman was breathing through a restricted opening, and had already prevented her from swallowing, and drinking water: and she was already nearing death, if she had stayed for one day or two days.Quamvis autem superius sit in gutture apostema, incide etiam superius; et si infra sit, incide etiam infra: sed non profundum ne ad os tangas.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had emitted two branches until they came out over the two nostrils.Ergo postea incisa in medio apostemate, et apice: et mox intrare intra eius medullam digitum, donec exciderit ad os: et postea excidere intrinsecus totum, usque cum excidit ad os.
Therefore afterwards I cut into the middle of the abscess and the apex; and then enter inside its marrow with a finger until it came out to the bone: and then cut out completely inside, all the way up to when it came out to the bone.I therefore hurried quickly, and fixed in one of them a hook.
Then I pulled on it, and pulled off a large portion from it.Et si non possit trahere, ut debet, propugnat ad extra per uncinum: et iterum trahit in altum.
Then cut it off where you grasped from the nostril.And if it cannot be pulled as it should be, push it outward with the hook; and again pull it hard.Then cut it off where you grasped from the nostril.
Then I did to him that which had come out of the other nostril.Et iterum excidi intrinsecus, donec omnia exciderint: et iterum traxi intra eius medullam digitum usque ad os, et feci illi quod facio in alio; et mox excidere intrinsecus totum usque ad os.
Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue; after that, I fixed the hook on the abscess itself, then cut off a part of it, and not much blood flowed from it; so the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water, then accepted food.
So I did not stop cutting out of that abscess many times over a long period; and the abscess kept returning in the place which I cut, until it became very large and went away with her.
I thought it best then, and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
She therefore stood for a long time; then she walked away from my side, and I did not know what God had done to her after I left her.
Of the cutting of an abscess on the uvula.
Chapter 37.
When a cold descends to the uvula and is long and swollen it is called a perpendicular one; but if it is thick and round in its lower part, it is called a vesicle.
When you have used upon it the treatment which I have already described and yet it gives no relief; and you see that the abscess is warm, quiet and thin: then you must cut into it.
And what is rounded and not long in it, and there is blood, or of the color of the skin, or black, and does not feel anything, then you must cut off the incision.
For there is fear in him on account of his weakness.
It is necessary, therefore, when you see it according to the way I have said, from its whiteness and length, that you make the weak one sit facing the sun; and press his tongue with an instrument, of which I spoke before; then fix a hook into the gum, and pull it down; and cut it with one or two instruments which I mentioned in the incision of both tonsils.
And you must not cut from it, unless that which is added above its natural limit without addition.Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.
For if you cut from it more, you will hurt the voice and speech.Et quia in ea est timor super infirmum: oportet ergo ut facias primum incisionem in eo, ubi non est timor nisi in suo loco: nam si incidis in alio, laedes eam.
Then after the incision use what we described in the incision of the two tonsils; and dress it, until it heals.
But if you are afraid of the weakness from the incision, then you must use cunning in cauterizing it without fear or trembling.
And the manner of cauterizing is not, except with sharp water; and it is, to place the head of the sick person in your lap.Et facies ignem in oculis eius et cauterizes intra omnes lacrimas: et postea curabuntur: et in pluris diebus curabuntur.
Then press his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned.
Then take from the water which I told you in the chapter on cauterizing, and dip with it an unquenched embers not thick nor thin, and fill from it the hollow of this instrument, whose form is like this.Postea confice cum ea calcem extinctam, et ponite spissem: et postea posueritis super concauitatem eius cuiuslibet ex aceto et oleum rariorem, quae in se contineat omnes lacrimas intra se, donec curentur.
Place this end, where the medicine is to be put, in a hollow like the hollow of a spoon.
And put the instrument with medicine above the wound itself; and let the sick person lie on his side, so that the medicine may run from his mouth out of inside, that no part of it may go down into his throat, and harm him.
Then hold your hand with medicine in it.
And you at the first upon that wound with a quantity of the medicine for an hour, until you see it already blackened and settled with the biting of the medicine. And if it be not so within the space of two days, then put the medicine to it again, by little and little, as is aforesaid; and do this two or three times a day. But let them not lie in their beds, where they voided their water and other filthiness, but let the beds be changed every day at least.
And if you would have a cotyle, and wrap it over the end of the tube, and pour out the medicine into the tube with a spoon, and thrust the tube with the spoon into the wound from above, until the cotyle sticks to the wound; and so let them be left an hour or two, unless there be any great need. And then pull out the tube gently by degrees, that you tear not away the skin with it; but if there be any blood, stop it up speedily, and do not let the person move his limb, till the blood is stayed. But if there be a great deal of blood, so that they cannot be staid, then take a ligature, and tie hard above the wound, and when the blood is stayed, untie it again; but if the blood run out again, bind it up in the same manner. Do this many times, until you have what you will of the cautery of the wound; for it is not necessary that the tube should touch the bottom of the wound, but that it be hot enough to burn the edges of the wound within, which if it do, yet shall the wound heal well. But above all things see that there be no moisture or pus about the wound, but keep them clean and dry; for unless they are so, you cannot have perfect cautery. When therefore you see a wound clean and dry, then may you use the cautery with good hope of health.
Then leave it off; for itself doth dry up and fall away after three or four days. But if it be a great one, then must it be opened, either with a pair of scissors, or with a razor, and the filthiness taken away, and the wound cleansed with wine and vinegar, and salved with an ointment made of oil of roses and quicksilver, or else with oil of nut-galls and silver, and so let it be staid up, till it be well.
But if you need to repeat the medicine, do so; and after cauterization wash about the wound with a cotyle moistened with butter, and cleanse that which is about it from the medicine, with cold water. And let it be bound up, with a cloth wetted in cold water.
And from without it is to be healed with poultices and from within with gargles until it has healed.
This kind of treatment therefore is healthier than by incision and further from fear.
And sometimes a ulcer is also healed with something subtler than cautery and incision; it is healed with fume, in this way.
Take calamus and hyssop and oregano and rue and asafoetida and camomile and abrotanum and similar herbs from among these; and collect all of them, or some of them, in a pot, and let them be submerged with vinegar and boiled; and let the pot be sealed with good clay: and let there be an opening in the middle of the pot, above which is placed a hollow instrument in this way.
Let it be made of silver or bronze; and let the end, in which is the pomegranate, be introduced into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor rises to the ulcer above the tube, until the ulcer is much obscured.
Then return above it many times, until it hardens.
And beware, lest you do this treatment at the beginning of the coming of the pustule.
For it adds pus to the pustule; and you ought not to do that except at the decline of its heat.
But if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a cane, and place on its end tallow; so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned; for the tallow hinders the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is a good treatment with health.
¶ Of drawing out thorns and bones from the throat.Et si in gola inter uigilia aut sub uigilia, aut inter uiolas, aut sub uiolas, aut quibuscunque locis corporis, aut intra laringem, aut extra laringem, aut intra sinus, aut extra sinus, aut intra labia, aut extra labia, aut infra os, aut super os: invenieris spinas, uel ossa, uel calcis, uel quoscunque locis corpusculi, uel carnes excoctas: et non possis extrahere manu, aut per olla, vel per cauterium.
Chapter 38.And if in the throat between the teeth or under them, or between the ulcers or under them, or in any parts of the body, or inside the larynx, or outside it, or inside the nostrils or outside them, or inside the lips or outside them, or below the jaw, or above the jaw: you find thorns or bones, or pebbles, or any kind of small bodies, or cooked flesh; and you cannot extract them by hand, or with a pot, or with cautery.
Many a time there clings to the throat a fish-bone, a thorn, or some other object.
You must therefore extract what is visible on top of the object that falls upon being pressed with an instrument against the sole, and it is made clear to you that there is something in the throat.
And that which is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, you must do a feeble vomit before food is digested in the stomach.
Perhaps indeed an annexed object will come out through vomiting.Et quod in gutture remansit et non possit extrahi, debet fieri caeterum per instrumentum ut facias laciniam aut suturam, et sic curat urentem.
Or the weak person may swallow the stalk of a turnip or the root of lettuce, or he may swallow a piece of dry bread, or he may take a piece of dry sponge and tie it in thread, then he must swallow it.
When therefore it has reached the place where there are bones or thorns and is extracted, then it will come out. If then it does not come out with that which we said, then use a lead instrument according to this form.Et facies laciniam postea per eandem uia ubi intruitur spina.
The radius is thicker than the ulna by a small amount and has a curve at its end which allows it to be introduced into the throat with ease; and it should be held raised upwards, so that the head is raised.
And care should be taken not to touch the epiglottis, lest a cough be caused by it and he push in with it bone or spit, or the doctor himself insert his hand.
However, it is better that the patient himself should insert it because of his knowledge of the location of the object; and he should push downward or draw upward his hand with the instrument, as much as is required for him, until it comes out.
Of the extraction of the leech.
CHAPTER 39.
When the leech is applied with that which I told you concerning the division by cure with remedies, and it does not work out, then consider in the throat of the patient before the sun or facing the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I described to you.
So if your sight falls upon the leech, pull it off with a small hook or with fine tweezers properly.Sed si non possis inueniere, trahe sanguisugam manibus tuis et capite versus.
If this is not possible with them: then take a concave tube and insert it into the throat of the sick person until near the throat: then insert into the concavity of the tube red-hot iron with fire.
Do that many times: and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Then let him take a full mouthful of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and move the water around one hour after another with his hand.
For indeed the leech immediately falls when it feels water.
But if he does not go out with that which we narrated, then smoke the sick person with bedbugs, or with asa with an instrument that I narrated in the smoking of the uvula.Et postea fac illud quod antea fecimus cum aqua frigida: et si non egreditur sanguisuga, tunc mandeat infirmus olem uini uirginis, et postea fac eum qui tenet manum suam in aqua frigida.
And then do that which we did before with cold water: and if the leech does not go out, then let the sick person drink the smoke of virgin wine, and then let him who holds his hand in cold water.Do that many times, for it will indeed fall out.
And the way of the operation in the smoking is that you take an earthernware pot, in which are live coals with fire: and the pot be covered with a cover, in the middle of which there is a hole: and the end of the instrument be placed in the middle of that hole.
Then throw out the smoke, and let the sick person place his mouth over the end of the tube, and close his mouth, so that the smoke does not go out, until you know that the smoke has indeed reached the leech.Et si uult, faciat etiam fumum cum ollam, in qua sint herba uiride et asa: et postea fac illud quod antea fecimus.
Then the leech falls off immediately.
If it does not fall off, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Let the invalid bear thirst, and eat salt food, and not drink water. It is necessary therefore that he should leave this regime.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it has fallen on itself being pressed.
It is like forceps, as you see: except that there is a hooked point which is inserted into the throat.
And its end is similar to that of a bird's beak which is called a stork's beak, in which there is a roughness like that of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let go altogether.
¶ Of the opening of Abscesses, and their incision, and treatment in general.
Chapter 40.De aperizione apostematum per sectiones et curis.
There are many species of apostema, many ways, according to the recall of those that came, namely one and one in this book; and they differ in their perforation and division from two ways.
Of these one is from the species of apostema in itself, and that because it comprises from humors.
And the second mode is because of the places in which it occurs from the body.Quod si omnes species et modi apostematum, super quos agimus, pro singulis exponeremus, multum tempus ad verbum requirerent.
For if we should expound all the species and modes of apostema about which we speak for each separately, much time would be required word by word.Because apostema occurring in the head is different from apostema occurring in the anus; and apostema occurring in a fleshy place is different from apostema occurring in joints; and each has its own judgment from operation.
And some apostemas are not to be punctured unless after maturity of healing in them and its complement; and some are to be punctured while they are raw and do not mature according to the complement.Et quidam oportet ut perforentur ante maturationem saniei, et quidam post.
And some ought to be punctured before maturity of healing; and some after.Such are apostemas that are near joints.Et quidam oportet ut perforentur ante incipientes, et quidam post incipientes: sicut apostemata quae sunt in capite.
Since an apostema when it occurs near a joint, and is prolonged to be of it, until putrefaction that which is in the circumference of it perhaps are corrupted ligaments, or nerves of that joint: wherefore it is a cause nearest of contraction of that member.
Or it is an apostema upon the principal member: for if you delay to pierce it, until it come to maturity, it will hurt either that, or the principal member through it.
Or it is near the anus, then pierce therefore itself immature; and you ought not to pierce a raw apostema, not of complete digestion, except what is near the anus, lest it putrefy deep, and be prolonged into the intestines of the anus, and become a fistula, or that in its end which does not heal.Quare velis aperire immaturum: quod si fieri non potest per viam lineam, ut supra dictum est, sed per punctum solum facias apertum, ut putrefactio omnino concidat: et illic per punctum, ubi apostema fuit, erumpent fluida corporis. Wherefore you would open it immature; and if it cannot be done by the way of a line, as said above, but you make an aperture only through one point, so that putrefaction is altogether stopped: and there through the point, where the apostema was, the fluids of the body will break out.You ought to know the hour of piercing the apostema, which is come to maturity according to its complement; and it is in the cessation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and throbbing, and acuteness of the head of the apostema: and the rest of signs. And you ought to make the same piercing in the lower place of the apostema, and of greater eminence; and let the piercing be wet in the length of the body, if there are apostemas in the parts of hands and feet, and places of joints, and chords, and nerves, and arteries, and at last in all equal places, where is no reflection.Et si apostema est prope nervum uel arteriam, et non potes aperire per punctum solum, sed per lineam: facit quod nervus uel artera non sunt adstrangentes post perfusionem: nam si nervus uel artera sunt adstrangentes post perfusionem, scis certo quod non est apostema in nervum uel arteriam per punctum solum: nam si fuerit prostratum nervum uel arteriam per punctum solum, non debet esse adstrangens.
In those parts which are reflected, proceed with the incision according to that limb.
However, when the pustule is in fleshy parts, it is better to leave it intact until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said above according to the complement.
For if you pierce it before this, the flow of pus will be prolonged from it, and there is much filthiness and foulness, and perhaps its lips become hardened, and its depth.
And some pustules are pierced according to the breadth of the body at need: or according to that limb which needs it.Quare, uideamus utrum sit in loco carnoso an non: et utrum sit prope ossibus vel ad illum pertinens vel non.
And it is necessary that you administer a small incision in small pustules, and a large incision in large pustules: or many incisions according to the similarity of the magnitude of the pustule.Et quando tu aperies apostemata carnosa, videas intra corporis profunditate ut non aperias illum ad profunde per totum corpus usque ad ossa.
And when you open fleshy pustules, see within the depth of the body so as not to open it deeply throughout the entire body to the bones.And there are some pustules in which the skin should be depressed: and incised when it has already become like a cloth, and has been made in the end, which is already dead: just as that happens in many places, as in dubelet, and in buboes.Et oportet ut fias peritus de cunctis his rebus quae diximus, et facias per experientiam quod tibi placet, et facias eam quae convenit et facies in termino suum.
And among these are those which are cut with a three-angled incision.
And among these is that from which an incision is made in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like an inguinal hernia.
And among these are those in which a circular incision and a crescent-shaped incision is made, and similar to these incisions.
But that which has no head, as are superficial and soft abscesses, must be opened with a superficial or simply a flat incision.
And it is necessary, when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, that you open it so that the pus does not flow out all at once in that hour; rather, extract a part of it.
Then pack the abscess until another day.
Then extract some pus again.
Do this several times according to the progress, until it is resolved; especially if the patient is weak and feeble, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man: for the animal spirit is often resolved from the animal with the discharge of pus; and perhaps the weak patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore be very cautious about this chapter.Et oportet, si apostema est superficialis et grossus, ut facias incisionem in medio, et extrahas saniem: deinde perfora eum perforatione plana, et secando.
And it is necessary, if the abscess is superficial and large, to make an incision in the middle, and to extract the pus; then open it with a flat incision, and dry it out.And after your incision, by which you open abscesses, it is necessary to cleanse the wound: and consider.
If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply lint from linen, or old cotton.Et si magnus: fac iterum licinia in medio apostematis, et per omnia latera.
And if it is a great wound, and there are many openings of perforations, then one should insert linseed into every opening until they reach the next one.
And if you have cut off a part of the skin in the wound, or bent it over in the border: then you should fill it with old wool, or as when a cloth is woven, or rubbed with flax without moisture; and tie it up until the third day.
Then throw it out, and dress it with that which is fitting from ointment, until it is healed.
If however the flowing of blood happens in your operating, then administer cold water and vinegar after the cloth has been dipped in it; and put it over the place of the flowing of blood many times.
If however the flowing of blood continues, then you should administer medicine, and dressing, and powders which I have described in many places of this our book, and after division.Et postea quodam modo ligatura praescribere cum eo quod oportet de unguento.
If however it is in the time of winter, and the place of the wound is of many nerves: then you should pour little bits with wine, and warm oil; and put them over the places.Et postea quodam modo ligatura praescribere cum eo quod oportet de unguento.
And if it is in the summer, and the places are fleshy: then you should put the bits which have been dipped in water, and oil, or that wine and oil, and all of it cold.Et postea quodam modo ligatura praescribere cum eo quod oportet de unguento.
Until when it is the third day, as we have said, then you should loosen the wound, and clean it, and administer in its dressing that which suits it, until it is healed.Et postea quodam modo ligatura praescribere cum eo quod oportet de unguento.
This then is what is necessary from the knowledge of the curing of wounds universally.Et postea quodam modo ligatura praescribere cum eo quod oportet de unguento.
According to the half however of distinction, I have already spoken of every wound, how it is the way to its curing head-wise singularly.Et postea quodam modo ligatura praescribere cum eo quod oportet de unguento.Et postea quodam modo ligatura praescribere cum eo quod oportet de unguento.
On the incision of sores that occur on the skin of the head.
(Chapter 41)
Sores occur on the skin of the head, and are like nodules, which are contained in a sac in the tunic, as if they were the eggs of a hen.
And there are many kinds of them.Quoqum omnes habent unam naturam et omnes eorum similiter curantur, sed diversimode ad populum diversitatem.
From them are fatty ones; and from them are those that contain a moisture like mud; and from them are those that contain a moisture like a paste or poultice; and similar to these, and from them are those which are hard like stones.
And in the cutting of all of them, and in their extraction there is no fear, as long as the cutting does not cause a contradiction to the artery.
And the operation in the cutting of them is that you try it with an instrument whose form comes later, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if there is moisture within, then dry it with a superficial cut according to this form: in this way.
And begin the cut from line b to line g. When the moisture is evacuated, then peel off the skin that contains it, and leave nothing behind at all.Nam si non excutias totum illum quod est super, sed dimitteris aliquid in eo, postea faciet ulcerum et non curabit.
He often returns if something is left behind. Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is available; and if not, then in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
For that which remains in the wound will be corroded.Si autem non possit extirparis omnimode, et necessitas exigat, incide super eum cum scalpellu, et extrahe cotum: et postea imple uulnus salis, et dimitte usque ad diem alium. But if you cannot in any way extract it and necessity demands, cut into it with a scalpel, and pull out the cotum; then afterwards fill the wound with salt, and leave it until another day. Then repeat over the wound with Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if it is needed, until you are sure that nothing remains in the wound, then heal the wound with ointment until it heals.
But if the abscess contains a hard lump: then cut it dry according to this form, having an incision in the shape of a cross; and throw out hooks between the two lips of the incision, and scrape it dry from every part; and try your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it.Et quod si remanserit aliquid, tunc intra se habens cotum: extrahe cum tenacibus et uncinis: et postea siccare eam usque ad ultimam rubeam, et postea imple salem et olea, et dimitte usque ad diem alium.
And if anything remains within the cotum: then extract it with forceps and hooks; and afterwards dry it to the last ruby-red, and then fill it with salt and oil, and leave it until another day. But if it defies you, then do what I will narrate to you after this.
And likewise do for an abscess, if it is stony, from incision and the same cure, according to what we have said.Nunc autem dicamus de cotum quod venit de omni parte uulnus: quod si est in parte, ubi non possit extrahi cotum cum tenacibus, tunc conare per omnes partes ut excurias eam. Now however let us say about a cotum which comes from every part of a wound: if it is in a place where the cotum cannot be extracted with forceps, then try from all sides to scrape it dry. And an incision over an abscess that is stony is easier, because there is little blood and moisture.Quod autem est in medio uulnus et in parte tenui, illud est pernicies magna et dificile ad curandum: nam cum incides super eum, sanguis fluens trahit cotum intra se, et quod est extra cotum non potest excurias.
And sometimes there are some of these sores which are in the head in some men with whom there is no moisture whatsoever.
Or after their piercing always from the lower part of them, so that the flow of pus may be relieved towards the lower parts.
Then treat these with what is suitable for them according to their cure.Sed si in capite fuerit apostema et paulo ante uenerit de aliqua uiscerum contusionibus, curantur illicibanturque omnia ut suprascriptum est.
On cutting Strophulus nodules on the neck.
De sectione strophularum in collo.
Strophulus is the common name of this kind of disease: a certain hard and firm tumour growing on the neck, or under the armpit, or in the groin, or anywhere else. There are many causes of strophulus: sometimes it is caused by external injuries; sometimes by internal diseases, such as gout, stone, or dysentery: it is also sometimes due to a cold or to heat.
And over those that come from them in the neck, are one and many; and they generate from each other; and every Strophula of them is inside its own tunic, as it is in the nodes and pustules of the head, as we have narrated.
And the kinds of these Strophulae are many.
And from them there are stony ones; and from them there are those that contain moisture; and from them there are malignant ones which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, when you see one of them that has a good disposition to touch, whose obviousness is close to the color of the skin, and moves to every part, and is not attached with the nerves of the neck, or with the artery, or with the vein, or is deep: it is necessary to cut it off by superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line, b. to the line, g., and peel it off from every side: and extend two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need that, as we said in the pustules of the head, and extract it gradually.
And there is over caution, that one does not fall upon a vein or nerve.
And let the scalpel not be very acute; so that you do not add your hand to you with incision, or disturb the sick person, and cut what is not necessary.Et sic facies in omni Strophula.
But if you cut a vein or artery, or prevent you from the operation, then put into the wound powdered larch, or some powders that stop bleeding; and tie up the wound, and leave it, until the acuteness of the pustule ceases, and the wound softens; or it begins and wants to fester.Et sic facies in cunctis strophulis: sed si non obediunt, quae diximus sicut de apostematibus capitis, et non exspectatur usque ad remissionem acuitatis, sed iterum crescunt, et uultu per se corruere intra, aut putrefacere, cum sanguine multo, aut cum pus multis: tunc oportet te facere incisionem superficialem ab superiore parte ad inferiorem partem corporis.
And then blood is cut off from the vein. Go therefore to your operation until you are satisfied.
Then care for it.
If the whole stone is cut then you must join together the two lips of the wound and press them together at once after you see that there remains no superfluity.
But if you see that a superfluity remains because of the size of the stone, then you must attend to cutting its root and taking it out; and apply the said stitch.
And what contains moisture from the stones, pierce it with a superficial piercing so that you see its place of ripeness; and put the piercing from that which follows below the body, as we said.
Then after the piercing administer the lint with ointment and similar to these, so that it may corrode what remains of corruption until when you see that the wound is already clean; then care for it with generative ointment of flesh, until it is healed.
¶ Of a section of the epiglottis from an ulcer in the throat.
Chapter 43.
The ancients wrote this section of the epiglottis and I did not see anyone in our land who did it; and this is the writing of their speech.Nam si quando intra guttur uenerit apostema, et non possit pertingui ad faciendam potum per os: sed debet facere per tubam: nam necesse est eum pertingere per tubam, ne moratur in gutture: quia moratura et statio facit dolorem et morem.
For those who have a synechiae, the incision of the epiglottis must be made: because there is no respiration through it; therefore, because all the veins and the lung are affected.
However, for those who have a warm ulcer in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no sickness in the pharynx, it is appropriate to use the incision of the epiglottis, to avoid loss caused by pre-choking. Therefore, when we want to do it, let us cut the epiglottis under three circles of the epiglottis, or four, with a small incision in width, in that which is between two circles in proportion, so that it is an incision in the soft palate, not in the cartilage: and this is indeed a convenient place for incision because it is deprived of meat, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
If the doctor is timid, then he must extend the skin of the throat with a hook.Et cum excidit cutem, non debet remittere sed debet facere sectionem in profunde per cartes cartilaginis: et cum venit ad mediam partem uentralis cartilis, debet inclinare se ad latum gutturis, et secere ad latera, ne excisionem faciat per mediam lineam.
Then he feels for the skin as far as the canal; he should stop the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should cut the lip that we mentioned before; and it is known from the section of the canal by the phlegm which comes out of it, along with what is split and torn off, and from the cutting of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
When therefore the time for fear of swelling has passed, bring together the two lips of the skin wound, and sutured only the skin itself without the cartilage.
Then apply remedies which cause flesh to grow until it is healed.
Albucasis says:
The sum of this speech which we have narrated is not explicated except when they see that one of these abscesses has now opened in the throat of the patient; and the patient was lifted above death and wanted his breath to be cut off: they apply to dry the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe through the wound, and be saved from death; and because of this they commanded to leave the wound open until the sickness is consumed, and its wickedness is three days and almost itself; then therefore they command to sew up the wound and cure it until it is healed.
And what I myself saw was that a maid took a knife and put it into her throat and cut a piece of the lung canal.
And I was called to cure her; and I found her groaning as is the groan of the dead.Et praesens erat mihi quod non crederet in medicinas nostras, sed in medicinas gentium: et dicebat mihi quod nisi uterer pro eius curatione per meam medicinam mortua esset, et uocabat mihi quod intrare in domum suam non debebam nisi meum medicamentum.
And it was present to me that she did not believe in our medicines but in the medicines of the people; and she said to me that unless I would use my medicine for her cure she would be dead, and she called to me that I should not enter her house except with my medicine.I therefore undid the wound, and I found blood which had come out of the wound.
And I was amazed that she had not cut the vein, nor cauterized; and blood was coming out of the wound.Et inueni quod sanguis non redderet sese, sed egrediebatur: et uocaui ad eam medicum qui curat uulnera sanguinis.
And so I cured him of his wound and healed him until he was well; nothing happened to the maid except a hoarseness in her voice, and she returned after a few days to a better state of health.
And so from this I say that there is no danger in an operation on the epiglottis.
On the operation of a hernia of the gullet.
CHAPTER XLIV.
This ulcer named hernia of the gullet, is a large ulcer, according to the colour of the body: and it is much in women.Et si non curatur, non moritur de ipso, sed multum laborat mulier.
And if it is not cured, it does not kill the patient, but the woman suffers much.And it is of two kinds; for it is either natural or accidental.Naturalis namque est quod per se crescit et non facit pulsum nec dolorem: sed facit mulierem crasum in convivio. It is not in nature to have genius.
Accidente are of two kinds; one is like a knot, the other is fatty.
The other mode is like an abscess that occurs from a blood clot in an artery.
And the fear is in it, and one should not make an assumption to cut into it with iron except when it is small; and you test it and probe it with a needle.
If you find it like a fatty knot and not hanging with any of the veins, then cut into it as knots are cut; and extract from the cyst what it contains if it is in a cyst; but if not, probe thoroughly throughout it.
Then treat the wound with whatever care is appropriate until it heals.
§ On cutting on Knots.
Chapter 45. There are many kinds of knots, and I have already said everything about their kinds in the division; and one should also relate here a difference between Knot and Abscess, when there is doubt. I say then that when there is heat and fever, and violent pains until the ebullition of the surplusage is stilled and putrefaction is finished, then the fever and heat cease.Et postea cum sedatur dolores, et exitus: tunc est Knot.
When there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and they are contained by a cyst, which is their own sac, and is of the same color as the body: and it is an incaeption of them like a pea, and becomes like a bean, greater or smaller.
And they are according to two kinds: either fat, or containing moisture.
And there are many colors of moisture, according to what I said in the division. Therefore, when you approach the cure of a Node, you should first examine it with an instrument called an Intromissum, according to its shape, as will come later in the next chapter.
And the way of examining pustules and all nodes is to take this instrument and introduce it into a moist place, which you will find in the pustule; and gradually roll your fingers with it, until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.Et statim sublimes, et aspires per instrumentum: sicque reuolues digitos tuos, ut non trahas illum per cutem, sed ut illum extrahatur per cutem.
Then bring your hand up to the level of the size of the boil.
Then extract the Ingredient and examine that which comes out with its discharge.
If therefore a flowing moisture comes out, of whatever colour; then dry it up with a superficial application, according as I have said concerning the other boils.
And if no moisture comes out with the Ingredient; then know that it is a suppuration; dry therefore its surface with an application made in the form of a cross, according to the form I have shown you: and lift up the cuticle on all sides with hooks gently; and keep the case if possible over it, so as to extract it entire with its Node.
If however the case is broken during the operation and it be not possible to extract it entire, for this often happens; then extract it in pieces, until nothing remains of it.Et si fuit pustula super cutem quae non est possible extrahere totam, sed etiam disruptam esse vidisti, et non possis extrahere illum nodum cum kistis, quia disrupta est: intrahe tamen et extrahe per se nodum cum omni care.
And if it was a pustule on the skin which could not be extracted entire and you found that it had been broken: yet enter in and extract the Node itself with all its contents.For if anything remains in it whether little or much, the Node will very likely come again.
If however you are not able to get it all out; then complete the wound with some caustic powders: and bind up the wound, and put over it what sits on the boil, warm, and cure it according to the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
If therefore there is a large Node; then have two lips on it, and cure it with what flesh-colouring it has.Et si sunt in ipso pediculi, et superficies eius non habet carnem ut carnis color sit: tunc incide intra ipsum, et fac ut extrahas carnem ad mundum, et cura omnia cum reliqua curatione. If however the vein is pulsating or not pulsating then you should wait and fill the site of the incision with a poultice and leave it tight for two days or three until the wound putrefies and the blood stops bubbling up. Then return to cut what remains of the knot.
Of external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Chapter 46.
There are three forms of the instruments which are introduced into wounds.The first kind are the instruments used to stop bleeding.The second kind are those used for probing and the third kind are used to cut up and pierce.
Of these there are large ones, medium-sized ones and small ones.The large instruments are used to open a path through flesh.
Let them be made of iron, with pointed ends, so that they can pierce the wound easily.And let their edges be very sharp, so that they do not tear the flesh when they are introduced into a wound.Their tips should be made thin and flat, so that they might be able to enter a wound smoothly.
These are instruments for probing and piercing and they have three kinds.One is called a probe, that is to say, a piercer, and it has two forms.There is one kind which is round and tapers to a point at its end, and there is another kind which is flat, but also tapers to a point.
Of these there are large ones, medium-sized ones and small ones.The large instruments are used for probing large wounds, the medium-sized ones for probing medium-sized wounds and the small ones for small wounds.The round kind is used to probe round wounds, the flat kind for flat wounds.And they should be made of iron which is red hot, so that any filth which may have collected in the wound will be burned away by them.
They are suitable for treating abscesses and fistulas and boils, because they can pierce right through to the bone.And when a wound has been probed in this way, it will heal up very quickly.Ex eis autem est magnum, et medium, et paruum: magna namque perforant omnes partes corporis, medios vero partes carnosas solum: parvas vero partes carnosas et ossa.
Of these there are large instruments, medium-sized ones and small ones.The large instruments pierce right through all parts of the body; the medium-sized ones pierce only flesh; the small ones pierce both flesh and bone.And some are made round, pointed and smooth, like large needles used to sew up seats made with felt.They may be made from citrine, or brass, or iron, or silver. The best of these are those made from citrine.They should be made very thin at the point, and somewhat broader above, so that they can pierce through a wound smoothly and easily.And when one is introducing them into a wound, let him first put something smooth over their points, such as linen, so that he does not tear the flesh.Ex eis autem est magnum et medium et paruum: magna namque perforant omnes partes corporis, medios vero partes carnosas solum: parvas vero partes carnosas et ossa.
And experiments are also made with black lead, which are suitable for being experimented on by them, whose concavities are reflections, in order that they may be reflected with their own gentleness with those reflections.
And there are again three kinds of them. For from them there are long ones, from them medium-sized ones, and from them short ones, according to the quantity of the breadth of the fistula and its tightness. The shape of bandages, and they are of many kinds. For from them there are simple ones, namely those with one curve; and they are of three kinds as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
And from them there are blind bandages; and they are of three kinds.Quoniam ex eis sunt ad punctum, ad duo puncta, et ad multos punctos.
And from them there are bandages to a point, to two points, and to many points.And from them there are hooks with two curves, and they are of three kinds; and from them there are hooks with three curves, and they are of three kinds; and all these are necessary in their place.Et fiunt Experientia etiam de stibio, quod vocant Antimonium, et de natro, et de solido.
And experiments are also made with antimony, and natron, and solid (substance).And these are the shapes of knives, with which they cut and scrape nodes and pustules; and they are of three kinds, for from them there is a large one, a medium-sized one, and a small one.Et fiunt Experientia etiam de salis nitri, et de sale armeniaco: quod vocant sublimum, qui est utilissimus in urentibus et ulciscibus, et in lue venerea.
Their extremities, by which the section is made, are acute; the other extremities are not acute, and are not so placed but that with them there comes a swelling in the excoriation of nodules upon the fear of the cutting of a vein or nerve; and that through it the infirm may be healed, and find some little relief from the burning which he finds upon the excoriation of an ulcer.
These are Magda, and are of three species.
They are made of air, and are like the radium with which alcohol is made; and in its broad end there is concealed a point of spatumil, and in it runs to the inward and to the outward when you will, as you see.
The form of spatumils which are concealed between the fingers upon the perforation of ulcers; and they are not perceived by the infirm; and they are of three species, great, middle, and small.
The forms of ventosars with which the flow of blood is cut off; and they are of three species, great, middle, and small.
Let them be made of air or citron-wood, round, somewhat long, as you see; and let them be to subtility.Et sint trium modorum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.
And let these species of ventosars be with you, great and small, that you may cut off blood with speed in necessity, and then when medicine is not present to you.Et si placet ut facias Ventosam ad subtilitatem per se, fac e citrino: et si non placeat ut addas ei aere, sed per citrinum sola sit facta.
However, you shall not use them for stopping bleeding anywhere in the body and you shall not use them except on fleshy parts such as those of the leg, thigh, arm, breast, belly, groin, and similar places, which are fleshy and moist.
And sometimes from them are made other small instruments similar to the husks of beans, according to their shape; with which blood is stopped when it flows from a phlebotomy wound or incision of a vein or artery; and sometimes from them are made round ones according to this shape:
§ Of the care of men's breasts which resemble women's breasts.
CHAPTER XLVII.
Sometimes the breasts of some men become swollen after sleeping (that is, when they begin to perspire in sleep) until they resemble women's breasts; and they remain badly disfigured.Et si quidam dormit super mammillam suam aut supra aliam partem carnosam corporis sui usque ad quadrantes quosdam dies vel noctes, et postea resunt apostemosae: quomodo enim somnus graviter inplicatur super partes carnosas corporis sui, ita eorum corpora suppurant et apostemosunt.
He who avoids this should cut from just below the nipple in a moon-shaped incision according to the shape of the lines - b and g. Then scrape off all the fat.
Then fill the wound with medicine for healing.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches and treat it until it is healed.
But if it hangs down toward the bottom and becomes soft because of its size, as happens to women, then two moon-shaped incisions should be made on both its upper sides, each joined with the other at their edges so that there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to the shape of the lines b and g. Then scrape away the skin between the two lips and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitches and powders, which are necessary for treatment, until it is healed.
But if you do not complete the incision which it is necessary for you to make because of the restlessness of the patient or because of the flow of blood: then you should fill the wound with a cotton pad saturated with corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ On the piercing of an abscess that happens under the nipple.
Chapter 48. These abscesses that happen under the nipple are of a hard species of Strophulus, which contains cysts and out of which there are those who contain moisture.Quo modo autem debemus procedere ad curam eorum?
Those, then, which contain humours should be opened by a lunar incision, according to the following figure, from line b to line g. When everything in the abscess has been evacuated from pus, fill it with old lint and leave it until another day.
Then the lint is removed, and the wound is treated with a suitable ointment until it heals.
If the abscess resembles a node of the Strophulus, cut over it as we have said when speaking of the incision for the Strophulus.
If, however, the wound is enlarged so as to expel pus, then administer cautery upon it as we have said above.
§ Of the incision for an abscess caused by an artery and a vein.
Chapter 49.De sectione lunari in carnibus uis et pannis.
When an artery is severed and the skin over it becomes hardened, an abscess often results from this; and likewise with a vein, that an abscess and swelling may result from it.
And the signs by which we recognize that an abscess and a swelling are due to an artery or a vein, are these: because when there is an abscess due to an artery, it is long and collected deep in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a kind of pulsation.
And that which is due to a vein, is round on the surface of the body.
And it is a mistake to lance such an abscess; this is particularly true of one under the armpit, or the groin, or the neck, and in many parts of the body; it is very serious.
Hence it behooves that such should be treated with the knife; and this also is true of those at the ends of them, or on the head.
Hence if there is an opening due to an artery in the skin as a result of an abscess, make a longitudinal cut in the skin over this.Et super illud quod est in cute per Venas, oportet finde in cutis sectione in latitudinis modo: et fac ut ex ea sanguis exuitur, et postea finde per eandem sectionem, et tene per suturam.
Then open the incision with hooks, then the artery; and free it from the tunics until it is exposed.
Then insert the needle underneath it and make it penetrate as far as the other side; and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, as I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Then puncture the space between the two ligaments with a spit-stick, until all the blood which is in it has come out, and the ulcer is discharged.
Then treat with an ointment that causes pus, until the ligaments drop; then cure it with suitable ointments for it, until it is healed.Et sic curas omne apostema quod ex Arteria procedit et quod non cadit per se.
And so you will cure any ulcer which proceeds from an artery and does not drop off by itself. If the ulcer is due to a vein incision, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much of the ulcer as possible along with the skin.Postea fac ut cadat cum cutibus qui tenent eum: et si non possit cadere, incide locum unde procedit Vena, et extrahe eam usque ad profunde, et fac postea ut cadat: nam in his duobus locis oportet ut fias peritus, et experientia docet te quomodo curare debes.
Then insert the needle under the spot you held with your hand and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread on it until you extract it from the other side.
Then tie with it the wound with a good ligature; as I told you about the ligature of a vein, from its two parts with the thread's two ends. But if you fear that the thread will be extracted, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole wound at the spot of the incision of the needle; press and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry the wound in its midst until what is inside it comes out; then cut off the superfluity of the skin and leave what was tied to it.
Then place over it a little poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Then give treatment, which is done with bandages and ointments, until it heals.
Of the wound that happened from a twisting of nerves.
Chapter L.
As happened to a vein and artery, similarly it happens to nerves; that which happened to them was a blow, or happened from superfluous exertion, and suchlike; and it mostly happens to them in places of joints, or the heel, and in every place in which joints move; and it is a serious wound. Its color is like that of the rest of the body and it has many dispositions without pain, and when it is tightly pressed, it feels to the invalid as if in a swoon.
And it is not an ulcer gathered in the depths of the body, but rather under the skin, and itself moves to every part, and does not go to the front or before, nor behind to the back.
Therefore what is in them at the joints should not be probed with iron.
Indeed, perhaps a contraction will occur.
As for what is of them in the head or forehead, find the skin with your finger-nail.
If therefore it is an ulcer small, then hold it with tweezers and cut it off from its root.
And if it is large, then lift it with a hook and scrape it; then pull it off and close the wound with stitches, and treat it until it heals.
§ On the cutting of an ulcer which occurs in the belly.
CHAPTER 51. It happens to some men many times in their bellies and other parts of their bodies that there appear what they call warts, like fungi.Et haec multoties generantur et crescunt, si non excidiantur, et postea recidunt.
These are many times generated and grow if they are not cut off, and afterwards they come again; whose root is very slender, and the top of them thick, and their lips turned inward.Et quae generantur super uel am insuper, sunt per se ut fungus, et multoties crescunt, nisi excidiantur.
And they grow upon the skin or flesh, and are like a fungus in that respect, and often grow very large unless removed.Quod ergo est super uel am, cum apparuit primum, tene manu tua, et tenens ipsum, trahe eum ad radicem, donec excidatur.
And as for what is on the skin, when it first appears hold it with your hand and pulling it, draw out the root, until it is removed.And indeed I have seen a man whose belly had two warts which were in all other respects like fungi; there was no difference between them save that they were white, minute in their root, and turned inward at the lips, and were hard to the touch, and moisture always oozed from them.Tene igitur manu tua eum quod super uel am est: et tenens ipsum, trahe ad radicem, donec excidatur.Et si non potes excidere, cum ferro incide ipsum in medio, nisi facias te dolere.
I cut them therefore, and found that one weighed about 10 and a half ounces and the other about 6 ounces. The operation to be performed upon them is as follows: if they are soft and of a yellow colour, and have a thin, moist root, then cut them with a broad knife, and have cauteries ready heated.
For very often much blood flows from the wound: therefore if the blood overpowers you be ready to cauterize it.
If you see that it is weak and pale and shrink back from the cut with the knife, then take a properly made thread of lead, and tie it tightly with it: and leave it for two days in the manner we have described.
Then add something to the lead to make it tighter.
Do not cease therefore tightening the lead, as often as it imprints itself upon the tumour until it is cut through and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the root of the tumour is thick, then there is a certain fear and danger when cutting it, especially when it is in the belly.
Nevertheless it is possible to cut half of it.Et quod restarit, scisse cadat per se: quoniam humidus radicis habet potentiam et motus.
Then you cauterize it so that it does not return.
Then heal him until the wound is healed.
And beware lest you think that the ulceration which is dark coloured, of little feeling and foul looking, to be a boil; for it is indeed a cancerous ulcer; and I will come again with the remembrance of Cancer after this.
¶ Of the cure of a hernia.Caput XIV.
Chapter 14.Chapter 52.De curatis mulierum post partum uirgineis.
Of the treatment of women after childbirth with virginity.There is a hernia from many causes.De cura herniae.
Of the cure of a hernia.Or from a crack in the navel, which is above the belly; and it comes out from it a testicle or bowels, according to what happens in other ruptures.De cura herniae ex fissura in umbelico.
Or from blood that flows from a vein or an artery, according to what has been mentioned above.Of the cure of a hernia from a fissure in the navel.
Or from a hernia caused by windiness in it.De cura herniae ex ventositate.
But if it is due to a crack in the navel, and there is an exit for the hernia: then its colour is like that of the body's skin; and it is soft, without pain; and there appear various locations.Of the cure of a hernia from a fissure in the navel.Si tamen est apostema coloris et exitu similis corpori, sed non lene sed tenui: sic est, quod appellamus in Latine Fissuram.
But if it is an ulceration of a colour and exit like the body, but not soft but thin: then it is what we call in Latin a fissure.And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestines, then its location, together with what we have described above, is more serious and diverse.Of the cure of a hernia from a fissure in the navel.Si tamen est pro egressionem althubis, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uery similaris.
When therefore you press it with your fingers, it sinks down; then it returns, and perhaps a sound comes with it; and it is much magnified near the entrance of the bath, and the going in is troublesome.
But if it be on account of moisture, it is loose; then when you press it with your hand, it neither sinks down, nor does a constriction or addition take place.
If however it be on account of blood, then an apostema makes its appearance, with these signs, to blackness from the nail.
But if it be on account of suppuration of flesh, then is the apostema grave, large, hard, and is fixed according to a certain amount.Quod si est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.
But if it be on account of inflammation, then its feeling is soft.Quod si propter uentositatem, tum tactus eius est lentus: si autem est propter suppurationem flebotomiae, tunc tactus eius est durus et calidus: si uero est propter suppurationem flebotomiae utrinque, tunc apparet apostema durum, calidum, et maculosum in medio. And the operation upon it is, that you should then consider whether the protuberance of the navel be on account of blood from an artery or vein, or inflammation; then you must abstain from its cure.Et si est propter flebotomiam utrinque, tunc apparet apostema durum et maculosum in medio: et operatio super eam, ut consideres tunc, quod si eminentia umbilici sit propter sanguinem Arteriae aut Venae aut uentositatem, tum oportet te ab curatione eius abstinere.
For there is danger and fear in it, as I have told you in the chapter, where I spoke of apostemas on account of an artery or vein.Nam in illo est timor et pauor: sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi de apostematibus propter arteriam et uenam
If the protuberance of the navel be on account of intestine or hernia, then you must command the weak person to hold his breath and stand up straight.Quod si eminentia umbilici sit propter intestinum aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum et stet stans extensus
Then with a cautery make signs round about the whole navel.Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.
Then tell him to lie back in your hands on his back.
Then go around with a wide spatula all around the navel over the spot you marked with cautery.
Then stretch the pustule upward, with a large hook.
Then tie it tightly all around with strong thread or silk cord; let the knot of the ligature be slacked.
Then open the pustule extended above the ligature.Postea resupina eum et ostende mihi.
Then if you find it caught by the ligature, then pull out the ligature and put your index finger into it, and push the intestine back inside the belly; and if you find a cyst, then grasp it with a hook and cut off its superfluity.
But if on the contrary an artery or vein is found, then go around it a lot.Postea resupina eum, et ostende mihi.
Then proceed with your operation.
And take two needles and insert into them two strong threads; and insert two needles around the edge which you made around the ulcer in the form of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Then tighten the ulcer in four places above the needles: and if you wish, take out the needles, and leave the place until the flesh extends and falls off by itself; or cut it when it becomes soft and putrefies.
Then treat it with what is appropriate from ointments until it heals.
If however a knob of meat is突出out into the umbilical region as a result of moistness or humidity, then it is necessary to press down on the ulcer as we have said above.
And you shall draw out blood or moisture which you find within it.
Then treat it with what will solidify the place.Et si admodum est profundum, et non potest per se cadere: aut incide in ea parte ubi eminentia est.
On the treatment of cancer. Chapter 53.
For I could heal no one from it; nor did I see anyone else before me who has been successful with it.
And the treatment of it, when it is situated as we have said, is to cut and to treat the patient of the black choler often.
Then bloodlet from him if you find him with a marked fullness.
Then prepare the patient for preparation, in which he will be placed with an operation.
Then cut into the ulcer with hooks that suit it.
Afterwards hollow it out from every part with the skin, according to the examination, until nothing of its roots remain; and let the blood run and do not cut it off rapidly but rather squeeze the spots and wipe away all the clotted blood with your hand or with whatever instruments can be used for that.
But if the flow of clotted blood from the incision of an artery or vein presents you with a contradiction, then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
¶ Of the Treatment of Dropsy.
Chapter 42.
We have already described the types of Dropsy, and how the accumulation of water takes place; and all the signs of each type, and its treatment with remedies.
And that which is treated with iron is not anything but a type of scrofula alone; and it does not come near to iron for the type of tympanic membrane; nor for the type of hyposarca, deeply, for that is deadly.
When you have already been treated for this type of tympanic membrane with remedies and the treatment has not sufficed, then consider.
For if the patient already has weakness, or he has another infirmity with the Dropsy, such as a cough, or looseness of the bowels, and their like; then beware of treating him with iron for that is dangerous.Et si medicatus es cum ferro: et non remisit, sed contraria facit tibi: tunc saepe ad uisum est mortem.
If you see a person weak from excess of strength and there is no illness with him except dropsy: nor is he a child, nor an old man: then the method of operating on him is that you raise up the patient standing between your hands, and the assistant behind him squeezes his abdomen with his hand pushing the water down to the lower part of the body.
Then take a spatulele with bristles, in this form.
It should have two pointed parts, long, with a pointed end like a spatulele.
However, it should have some brevity so that you do not go through with it during the operation to the intestine, and harm it.
Then consider.
For if the cause of the dropsy is from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you elongate with a cut from the navel by the amount of three fingers, towards the lower parts directly above the pubic bone.
But if the cause of the dropsy is because of a sickness of the liver, then your cut should be on the left side from the navel by three fingers.Et sic debes operari, sicut dixi tibi antea de Hydropisi, nisi quod post operationem non debes fieri spatium in sectione tua ad intestina et laedas illum: sed debes operari et debes perferre usque ad extremitatem.
And if the cause is in the spleen then let there be a cut on the right side; and it is also not appropriate for the cut to be on the side above where the sick person wishes to lie so that the flow does not run into that weak spot.
Then pierce with an instrument all of the skin.
Then insert into that opening and lift up your hand with the spatula between the skin and the flesh, as if you were flaying it; and let the amount that is flayed be about the size of a fingernail, or around that.
Then pierce and scrape until the spatula reaches the hollow place; and this is the place for water.
Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument of which this is the shape.
And it is like a tube: it is made of silver or brass or bronze, smooth and bright: at the bottom of which there is a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two on one side and one on the other; and its end is cut, in the manner of the cutting of a reed, as you see; at the top of it there is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches water, then it comes out immediately over the instrument; therefore it drains off the water in the hour a medium quantity.Et quando peruenit ad locum uacuum, et ad humorem acrimoniam, tunc non potest ire super instrumentum sed uadit circa ipsum.
And when it reaches the hollow place and the sharp humor, then it cannot go over the instrument but goes around it.For if you drain from it more than is right, in an hour perhaps the sick person dies through the resolution of his animal spirit; or it happens to him syncopes which draw near death.
But drain from it according to the quantity of its strength, and according to what the dispositions of the sick person show you from the strength of his pulse, and from his goodness.Nam si tu uides que est animus in toto corpore infirmum dispersus, et non in uno loco, sed quasi totum illud exuitur corporis humore, tu aduersum facias eam, ut non omnia simul omittas: nam si tu sic facies, moritur.
Then withdraw the instrument and hold back the water.
This is because it will be held immediately by the skin which holds the orifice that is above the nose; about which I have told you, so that you pierce through it according to that mode.
Then repeat the instrument on the following day, if you see that it is tolerating it; and also withdraw a little from the water. Do this for several days without fear, and be careful to avoid mistakes: until there remains hardly any of the water.
But if you are afraid for the patient because you have left a large amount of water behind: then treat him with burial in hot sand, and profuse sweating in the bath and in the sun, and let him wait until he is thirsty; and treat him with drying remedies, until he recovers: and cauterize the stomach, liver and spleen after the removal of the water: according to what I have told you beforehand.
On the care of children who are born with their urinary orifices not yet perforated.
Chapter 55.¶ Cumque perfierit, deinde retine illum statim, donec potest: et tene super aqua rem multam in vas quod habet foramen parum ample, ita ut non possit per illud exire: et stabili eum ita, ita ut non cadat: nec facias illum ad urinam ire. When one of the children leaves his mother's womb, and the orifice of his penis is not yet perforated, or it is a narrow orifice, or in an improper place.Deinde tene super aqua rem multam: et itera ad urinam eum iterum iterumque: donec discedat ex eo qualis est sibi conveniens: et ita perfies.
You must then hold a lot of water over him; and make him urinate again and again: until he passes the urine as it should go: and thus you will have perforated it.So one ought to assist with his perforation immediately after he is born with a very thin spatulum, in this way.
Then insert a slender lead pin into the orifice and tie it; and hold him thus for three or four days.Si autem non potest tolerare ligaturam, sed exuit se eam, deinde retine aquam super eo per dies aliquot: donec possit tolerare ligaturam, et facias talem post mortem infanti.
When therefore he wants to void his urine, let him move away and let it flow.
Then bring him back in.
And if you don't put in a catheter, it is now possible that the urine which runs over the place does not allow him to close it up.
However, he whose opening is narrow is treated with a catheter, as we said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Those, however, in whom the opening is not in its proper place, are harmed.
This is because in them who are born with it the opening is at the end of the penis: therefore he cannot urinate forward until he lifts his penis by hand to the upward position. Nor is there reproduction for him, because the sperm cannot reach the womb according to its proper course; and it is a very serious disease.
And the method of operating on him is that he lies sick on his back.
Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a strong extension, and cut off the head of the penis at the place of the glans, with an awl or a sharp spit-stick, as if you were cutting a reed, so that its middle comes out like the head of the penis; and let the opening fall in the middle according to what is proper.
And beware of you during your operation from bleeding.
For often it happens that that happens.
Then close up on him with that which stops the blood, and heal the wound until he is cured.
§ Of Albucasis, which occur in the foreskin and head of the penis, and putrefaction, blackness, and adhesions.
CHAPTER 56.
These things occur often in the penis, and there is an eminent mass of evil flesh.Et multotiens ex ea venena procedit mortem inducens, nisi eradicetur: quare necesse est ut de ea remoueatur carnes, et eleuat super eam sanguis, donec corrumperitur venenum, et peribit virga: et ueniat in locum uirgae.
And one of them is malignant and another not malignant.
Therefore the non-malignant one you must lift up with a hook and cut off, until you have cleansed it entirely.
Then place over it a pad soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it afterwards with dyaphinic ointment until it is healed.
If the albarter is malignant, foul of colour, then you must apply to it a cautery after its incision and scraping.
If the albarter is under the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and a part of it is within, and a part of it outside, then you must cut out first that which is inside, until it heals; then treat that which is outside: because when you treat them both at once, the prepuce will not heal.
And now they also occur in the testes and foreskin as darkness and corruption.
Therefore you must hollow out all that has turned black already, or is about to become so, or has already rotted.
Then wash over it afterwards with honey mixed with bran from the husks of grapes and herbs sifted through a sieve.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.Quod si accidit quod est in albithero in carni, non tamen utraque parte, aut utrumque partem per se faciat exulcerationem: tunc oportet ut incidas illum primum, et curas post illum cum unguento Aegypio.
If it happens that it is in the albither and in the flesh, not yet on both sides, or that neither side makes an ulcer by itself: then cut it first and treat it afterwards with Egyptian ointment.But if blood flows, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, in this shape.
For the cautery has two uses at once: for the flow of blood and a wound when it rots.Et si accidit quod incisis non curatur, sed post illum fluere uelut rore concussus est, donec corrumperatur et mortui colorem accipiat, quia cadaveris similis est, quoniam nequaquam sanetur nisi cum cauterio.
If the head of the tool is eaten away and the whole instrument destroyed within an hour, then a tube of lead should be inserted into the penis so that the invalid can urinate through it.
However, when the foreskin adheres to the head of the tool and this adherence does not occur unless the foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not necessary over it; and sometimes the adherence occurs because of a wound or an ulcer: then you should scrape away at it with a blunt spatula until the ligament dissolves and the head of the tool is freed from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then you should scrape a little off the head of the tool and off the foreskin.
This is because the foreskin, when it is thin, perhaps is perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the tool with a thin linen cloth which has been softned in cold water so that they do not adhere again.Postea oportet ut friczes super eam cum iocunde uel ocimo, donec liberata sit ex omni parte: post haec oportet ut intromittas super praeputium aquam calidum salubrem, et linites super eam.
Afterwards you should rub it with a sponge dipped in warm water and with salt until it is completely freed all over; then you should pour warm healthy water over the foreskin and apply ointment to it. Finally, let it be treated with a styptic wine until it heals. ¶ Of cleansing infants, and of their cure when they are wounded by mistake.Quod si accidit error cum infans interfacias, et caput uiriae aderat ad praeputium: oportet ut excores prima adhaerentia cum spatulo obtuso, donec disciant: nam si exciderit caput uiriae, tunc oportet ut curas eam cum vino stiptico.
Ch. 57 Head [of the penis]If the foreskin adheres to the head of the tool and this adherence does not occur unless the foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not necessary over it; and sometimes the adherence occurs because of a wound or an ulcer: then you should scrape away at it with a blunt spatula until the ligament dissolves and the head of the tool is freed from all sides.
Circumcision is not a remedy for continence, as are other wounds; however, since it comes from our action, our will, and its use is proper to children, it is necessary that we mark in it a better action and an easier path leading to health.Quod si infans post circumcisionem uenerit adhaerentia, et praeputium aderat ad caput uiriae: oportet ut curas eam cum vino stiptico, et friczes super eam cum iocunde: nam non debes excidere de capite uiriae: sed quandoque per accidens est subliminus in praeputio, quod non curatur nisi excidendo.
I say therefore that the ancients did not tell of circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws and there is nothing except what we have acquired by experience.
That is because I have found most of the artisans and phlebotomists using purification by circumcision with a knife and tweezers; they use cauterization with a thread, and cutting with a nail.
And indeed I have already tried all these ways, and I did not find any better purification by circumcision with tweezers and binding with a thread.
Because the skin often escapes circumcision.
Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers, so perhaps it happens that the upper skin is cut and the lower layer remains; therefore, it is necessary to go to the incision again to cut the other, and then future pain.
And with purification that is done by cauterization, which is digital, that the seamstresses use; it does not secure the incision of the end of the male member because perhaps it will enter into its hole.
But with purification by cutting, perhaps the iron goes out and ruins your operation; and indeed the skin of the boy is short in nature, and often they are born so that they do not need circumcision: and I have seen it myself.
But with purification by tweezers and binding with a thread, I have found out from experience that it is good because the tweezers are proportional to the incision, therefore, because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.Quod ergo facimus cum forficibus, non debet debere mutari: quod enim mutamus in eo, quod est uelut primum faciemus.
What we do with tweezers should not be changed; because if we change it, it is as if we are doing it for the first time.When you press your hand therefore, the two sharpnesses become proportionate and they cut according to one operation in one moment: and a compression of similar figure is made, containing the skin of the foreskin from every part, with which there does not fall any error at all.Quod enim debet esse omnino per totum ab extremo ad extremum, quod non cadat error.
And the manner of operation is peculiar to each, especially the boy; for if he be one who understands a little, you will not do it unless you attach a thread to his foreskin alone and let him go until another day.
Then cause him to enjoy and rejoice in every way possible, because of what he receives from his understanding.
Then insert your hand into his foreskin and blow upon the skin and draw it up until the head of the foreskin comes out.
Then cleanse it from that which gathers there in the way of dirtiness.
Then tie up the place marked with a double thread.
Afterwards, tie up a little lower with a second ligature. Then hold with your index and thumb the place of the lower ligature firmly, and cut in between the two ligatures.
Then lift up the skin quickly and extract the head of the foreskin.
Then let the blood run out slowly (for it is better thus), and put powder over it; and over the powder a cloth which has been wetted with a beaten egg mixed with rosewater, beaten up with oil of roses. A fresh one; and leave it on him until the next day, and look after him with the rest of the cure until he is healed.
And the form of the scissors for purification is this.
Let there be two points which are blunt and let them be turned in so that no point of the branch comes out; and let the length of the two sharp parts be equal to the length of two thumb nails alike.
The mistake however falling into purification is; for it may be that all the inner skin, or a part of it escapes at the incision.And let there be two handles, and let them be bent. Hence it is proper that you extend this from your own nail before the aposteme of the site and cut it according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your nail then pull it out with a hook and cut it.
But if three days have passed and what is under the thread remains swollen, let it go until the aposteme sits warm, then peel it with ease and cut it according to how it is prepared for you; and beware of the head of the thread.
For that will not harm it.Et si quae praeterierint dies tres et non remanet inflatum sed secundum uirgam, sed tamen dolerit, tunc incide illum locum cum facie uirgae.
And if more than three days have passed and it is no longer swollen but according to the thread, yet it still hurts, then cut that site with the face of the thread.Therefore take care of it with that which consolidates a wound from powders, which we spoke of in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut from the skin above a measure, and it flows towards the higher places, that does not hurt it either.
Therefore take care of it with what we said until it heals.Et si dolerit quidam diu post apostemationem, et non potest placari cum facie uirgae nec cum ungue, sed tamen non erumpit sub uirga: tunc trahe illum locum ad se cum uncino, et incide illum usque ad os, donec sanguis fluat, et sedet calidus, et excoria illum cum facilita, et caue de capite uirgae.
And if someone hurts for a long time after aposteme, and cannot be calmed with the face of the thread or with the nail, but nevertheless does not burst under the thread: then pull that site towards you with a hook, and cut it up to the bone, until blood flows, and let it sit warm, and peel it with ease, and beware of the head of the thread.¶ On the extraction of a retained grape in the ureter.Et si praeterierint dies tres post apostemationem, et non potest remitti dolore cum facie uirgae nec cum ungue sed tamen non erumpit sub uirga: tunc trahe illum locum ad se cum uncino, ut diximus: et incide eum usque ad os donec sanguis fluat et sedet calidum.
And if more than three days have passed after aposteme, and the pain cannot be relieved with the face of the thread or with the nail but nevertheless does not burst under the thread: then pull that site towards you with a hook, as we said; and cut it up to the bone until blood flows and sits warm.Chapter LVIII.De urina sanguinolenta et quae uenena est:
On bloody and poisonous urine:The retention of urine in the ureter is caused by an obstruction made from a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or swollen flesh, and similar things to those which we spoke of by way of cure in division.Et si ueniat urina sanguinolenta et multum retentio fit, sed non potest remitti cum facie uiriae nec cum ungue: sed tamen non erumpit sub uirga, quia non est illa facta ex carne nata: sed est eius causa pus et congelatio sanguinis aut lapidem: et dolerit multum.
And if there is no relief from urination, and you see the retention of it is due to a stone which has already entered into the bladder: then he ought to be feeble above his knees, bent over his crutch.
Then let his feet be placed on his back, and let him stretch out his womb from the upper part of his back, and let him draw his breath as much as possible.
He is forced therefore with his bladder towards the rear to expel the stone; wherefore urination is relieved.
If it is not relieved with that which we have said, and the thing be obstinate on the feeble one; then you ought to administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is thus: Let it be of silver, and be slender, smooth, hollow as a feather-cane in slimness, long in likeness of the palm of one and a half: let there be a slender cannula at its head.
And the manner of exit of the bladder through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie at its end some wool, or cotton, good ligature; and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with tweezers if something excesses from the wool, true enter into the cannula with the feeble one, as though a louse.
Then smear the syringe with oil or butter, and alum egg-white; and let the feeble one sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and its urethra with oils moistened, and olive oil, and tepid water.Et adplicet eum super sedingem suam, et super crutchum seu curuam: et facit dextra sua quod tenet siringam ubi est cannula, ut intrare in uesicam et extrahat Lapidem si possibile sit: et adhaereret ad locum illa res per olea.
And apply him to his seat, and over his crutch or curvature; and let his right hand do that which holds the syringe where is the cannula, in order that it might enter into the bladder and draw out the stone if possible: and adhere to its place that thing by means of oils.Then introduce the syringe into the urethra with ease, until it reaches to the root of the urethra.
Then double it above from the navel's part.Et sic iterum facit donec perueniat ad radicem uesicae: et sic extrahit Lapidem cum siringa per cannulam in ipsum. Then push the syringe into it until it reaches the bladder; and the sick person will feel that it has reached a hollow space. And this is not done according to this order unless because the passage into which it goes is one in which there is a bend.
Then gradually extend the thread with wool.
For the urethra will follow the wool.
Then pull it out and let the patient pass urine; and repeat the operation with the syringe, and do not cease to do this until the bladder is emptied and the sick person feels relief. Of the quality of the enema with a hydropulper.
CHAPTER LIX.De uirtute Cliteris uirginei ad expellendam uel excrescentem uitrum intra uesicam et urethram, et de modo conuertendi et retrahendi eam in locum seu ordinem primum: et de remedio ad uesicam obiuiam.
For it is closed at one end.Et aliter: Cum uirga de uirgine fiunt clisteres ad expellendam uitrum intra uesicam et urethram, per quod non possunt bene exire.
And otherwise: Enemas from the hydropulper are used to expel a growth within the bladder and urethra through which it cannot pass easily. And there are three holes in it, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.In primo foramen fiunt uasa quae trahunt in uesicam medicamentum et aquas, et haec fiunt de choro: aut de lumine uaso, aut de lumine piumato, vel de lumine de auo uaso: et fiunt breuia, ne trahant multum ad intrauerendam in uesicam.
Let the hollow place in which is the thing that propels be according to the quantity of what blocks it up without addition, until when it is drawn with something, moisture is attracted: and when it is propelled, it expels along with it to a distance, just as a water clock does when it ejects naphtha, that is Greek fire in martial conflicts.
When you wish to eject moisture into the tube, insert the end of the water clock into the moisture and draw with it what propels towards the upper regions, for the moisture is drawn into the hollow of the water clock. Then insert its end into the tube as we narrated in the syringe.
Then propel the moisture with it that propels; for that moisture will at once reach the tube, so that the sick person feels it. The shape of an enema which is inserted into the tube is as follows.
Then introduce a strong thread into those foramen, as they are unwound. Then aggregate the circle, as it is aggregated to a brother: after you put in it that which you see from moisture, and oils, and waters.
Then ligature it itself in the instrument: and do with it as you did with the purse out of expression with your hand, until moisture arrives at the purse.
Of the extraction of Stone.
CHAPTER 60.De extractione lapidis. I have already spoken of the various kinds of stones, and of their treatment by medicine; I have also described the difference between a stone formed in the kidneys and bladder, and the signs of these two; I have described also the kind of stone which is found on operation with the hand, and that which results from incision. The former is generated in the bladder itself, while the latter is produced in the ureter. In describing them I have been explicit and concise.
I say therefore, that a stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in children.
And by its signs it is known that the urine which comes from the bladder is like water in its thinness; and there appears in it a white sand, and the penis rubs feebly against the urethra, and struggles with it, and often hangs down. Then it is pushed out, and comes away with the anus in many cases.Et si ego dixi quod Lapis generatur in renibus, et uesica, id est pro illis qui multotiens cadunt cum urina, quia non cadunt, nisi interiit eorum uesica pro ea; sed cadunt cum urina in eam.
And if I have said that the stone is generated in the kidneys and bladder, this is true of those who often drop with the urine; for it does not drop except when their bladder has become thin from it; but they drop with the urine into the bladder. And it is easy to cure children up to the age of fourteen years.
And it is difficult in old men.Et illum qui cadit cum urina, ex uesica non generatur: sed cadit eam in renibus: et si cadat in uesica, cadit eam, quia non potest intrare in urethram, propter magnitudinem suam: et cadit urina cum eo.
And in the young [men] it is in the middle of that which is between these; and to him whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if smaller, its cure is with the reverse of this.
And when therefore we come to the cure, it is necessary in the first place that we cleanse the sick man with an enema which shall draw out all filth that is in his intestines; for this often hinders the discovery of the stone at the examination. Let the sick man then be taken and shaken, and moved about to the lower parts, so that the stone may pass down into the bladder, or leap from its high place several times.
Let him then sit ready between your hands, and let his hands be under his buttocks, so that the whole urethra may be declined towards the lower parts.
Let him then be examined and felt from without.
If therefore you feel the stone in its place, hasten at once with an incision above it.
If it does not at all pass under your touch, then you must wipe the index finger with oil of the left hand if he is a boy; or the middle finger if he is a full-grown youth, and insert it into his anus, and examine for the stone until it lies under your finger, and gradually turn him towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press above it with your finger and drive it towards the outside to the place where you intend to make the incision; and give orders to your assistant to press the urethra with his hand, and give orders to another assistant to extend the testicles with his right hand to the upper parts, and with the other hand to move the skin which is under the testicles in that part from the place where you intend to make the incision.
Then insert the Spatulam incidens of such a form.
And find a place between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle but to the left side of the thigh; and let the incision be made above the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transversal, so that it may be wide outwardly, and inwardly narrow, according to the quantity by which it is possible for the stone to pass out.
Perhaps a finger has been compressed, which is in the anus near the incision, and will come out without difficulty.
And you should know that there is a stone which has angles and edges, so its exit is difficult because of that.
And from it there is one smooth like a gland and round; and its exit is easy.
And therefore the one who has angles and edges, add to the fissure.
What if it does not come out like that, then you must use cunning on it: either press on it with a decent gestic, whose end is like the moon, which presses on the stone and does not slip off it; or to put under it a subtle instrument, curved-end.
If you cannot get above it, then increase the opening slightly.
But if anything overcomes you from blood, cut it off with a scalpel.
If the stone is larger than one, then push first the large one towards the urethra opening.
Then cut into it.Quo facto, si non egreditur, uti debes cum vaciando per uulva ad impletum.
After that, if it does not come out, you should use vacuum through the vagina to completion.Then push a small one after that; and likewise do if there are more than two.
If the large is very great, then ignorance is to cut sections on it.Et scias quod non debes secare super illum ultra unam palmam: et facias deo gratias qui tibi dedit tale medicamentum.
And you should know that you should not cut on it beyond one palm; and do thanks to God who gave you such a medicine.Because it happens to the weak one of two things, or that he dies, or there happens to him a constant distillation of urine: because the place is not consolidated at all.
But manage its expulsion until it comes out; or use cunning in its fracture with tweezers, until you pull it out little by little.Et quod tibi placebit, fac.
And when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with thyme, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and press on it, and put over it a cloth infused with oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water, so that the hot ulcer will be sat upon.Et fac postea uti sanguine draconis in eo usque ad curatiem: et fac ea quae dixi tibi.
Then you shall keep the patient bent over his neck and not to loosen the ligature until the third day.
When therefore you unbind it, wash the place with water and plenty of oil.
Then treat it with diaphoretic ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.Et si quid de his omissum fuit, in alio loco monstratur.
If however something has been omitted, it is shown in another place.But if a hot abscess occurs in the wound and corrosion and like things, as if the blood congeals in the bladder and there is an obstacle to passing water: and this is known from the issue of blood with the water.
Then put your finger into the wound and draw out that blood.Postea uterit se liberius, et non faciat urina uel sanguis: et cognoscatur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina, et sicut uulnus emendat.
If it remains it provokes the corruption of the ureter and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water and salt; and apply any medicine that is suitable for it during its cure until it heals.
And it is necessary, at all times during the cure, that you tie up and compress the thighs, because of the medicines which are put upon the wound.
If it is a small stone, and it lies in the ureter, and is stuck there, obstructing the flow of urine; then treat it as I described before you proceed to cutting.
Very often this treatment will save you from an operation, for I have already tried it out. Get a perforator made of iron with this shape: triangular at the tip, sharp and mounted on wood.
Then take a thread and tie it round the ureter under the stone so that it does not return to the ureter.
Then thrust the piercing iron gently into the ureter until the perforator reaches the stone; and twist the perforator in the stone gradually, making its hole bigger, until you have made it penetrate from the other side.
The urine will then flow out immediately.
Then press your hand upon the remnant of the stone on the outside of the ureter.Et per stringentes ligaturas, extrahatur totus, et reuocatur ad locum curationis cum aceto et sale.
For it is broken up and comes out with the urine and the invalid is healed.Et si non possit extrahi, iterum intromittitur Perforatorium in eum locum ubi lapides, et conteritur: et iterum per stringendas ligaturas extrahitur et cum urina egreditur, quod frustrum erat.
If this treatment is not available to you for some reason, then tie a thread under the stone and another thread above it.And if he cannot be extracted, the perforator is thrust into that place where the stones are, and crushed: and again by tightening the threads he is extracted, and comes out with the urine, what was left of it. Then cut across the stone in the ureter between the two threads.Et si non potest extrahi totus, quod est possibile: tunc cum ferro perforatoris, incide locum, et dispiega per stringendam ligaturam: et cum urina egreditur.
Then extract it itself.
Afterwards loosen the ligature and clean away the congealed blood which is found in the wound.
And there is no need of the ligature of thread under the stone except to prevent its return into the wound; and another ligature above it, except that when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin may return to its place and close over the wound; and on account of this it is necessary for you, when you tie the upper thread, to draw up the skin to the upper part, in order that it may return to your completion, and close over the wound, as we have said.
Of the Extraction of a Stone from Women.
CHAPTER LXI.
A stone is seldom generated in women.
But if it should happen to any of them to have a stone, then the cure is difficult and prohibited on account of many considerations.Nam primum per vulvarem ostium non potest extrahi nisi per pluerum, et omnia viscera periculosa sunt in illo transitu: postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.
One of them is that perhaps the woman is a virgin. And second is because you do not find a woman who discloses herself to a doctor when she is chaste or from those having husbands.
Third is because you do not find a woman well knowing this art, especially the operation with hand.
And fourth is the distance from the stone place; therefore it needs deep incision and there is fear in that.
If necessity compels to that, then you must take a female doctor, well knowing: and little is found.
If however you are deprived of these, then seek a chaste doctor, subtle and experienced female obstetrician in the matter of women, or a woman who suggests a part of the art; make therefore her present, and especially to her, so that she may do all which you instruct her to after examination over the stone. At first that is, so that she may look if the woman is a virgin; then it behooves that she should insert her finger into her anus, and seek the stone.Et si illuc non possit ire, tunc faciat illum, ut intromittat in anum eius digitum, et quaerat manibus lapidem, et quod invenit ponat extra: sed neque ita debet trahere ut cum ea res sit, ut cum eo perierit.
And if she cannot go there, then let her do that, so that she may insert a finger into the anus and seek by hand for the stone, and what she finds put outside; but not so must she draw it out as with that, so that with it perishes. If therefore she finds it, pinch it under her finger, and then order the obstetrician to insert his finger into the vagina of the weak one, and seek over the stone after he puts his left hand over the pubic bone and presses it good compression. If therefore she finds the stone, then it behoves to move it gradually from the opening of the urethra to the lower parts with utmost of his power, until he reaches with it to the root of the hip.Et si non possit moveri per inframusculare ad coxam, sed uellet cum eo per os ueluum: facit ergo obstetrici ut intromittat digitum suum in uesicam eius usque ad inferios per os ueluum, et quaerat manibus sub digito suo.
Then he cuts above him at the level of the middle of the pubic bone at the root of the hip, from whatever side it is prepared for him, and feels for the stone in that part; and his finger must not be removed from the stone as he cuts under it; and let the incision at first be small.
Then he inserts a probe above that incision.
If therefore he feels the stone, then let him increase the size of the incision in proportion to the size of the stone as it comes out from it.
And you should know that there are many kinds of stones.Unus est globosus ut glans testiculi et magnus. One is spherical like a testicle and large.Out of these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one with branches.Et sunt qui faciunt in urina vires et non egreduntur nisi cum sanguine:
And there are some that cause pain in the urine and do not come out unless with blood.Know therefore the kind of stone by this means, as I tell you about it above.Et quando senserit lapidem et invenerit partem ex qua ego non possum extrahere, tunc ad illam removeat omnes ossa ueteres et super eum, et faciat ibi sectionem magnam:
And when he feels the stone and finds that it is impossible to extract it from one part of it, then he should remove all the old bones above him, and make a large incision there:and if blood overcomes you, then add powdered garlic in the spot, and hold it for an hour until the blood stops.Et si sanguis non cessat, sed ueniat ad os ex qua sanguis egreditur, et illa contremit:
If you are overwhelmed by a flow of blood and know that the blood is coming from an artery which has been cut then place powder on the site and compress it with decent ligature and do not stop it; leave the stone and do not extract it.
For perhaps the feeble woman will die.
Then attend to the wound.
When the acute flow of blood has subsided and some days have passed and the site has become putrid then return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
On cutting the water hernia.
Chapter 62.
The watery lump is not water but an accumulation of moisture under the white membrane which covers the testicle containing the ovum; and it is named a cyst. And sometimes it is within its own pouch which nature has prepared for it in the part of the ovum; and that is another ovum, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white cyst we have mentioned before; and it does not happen except rarely.Et si fit, non est in ouo, sed extra ouum.
And if it is formed, it is not within the ovum but outside of it. And indeed the generation of this cyst happens due to weakness which occurs in the testicles; therefore this matter is poured out onto them.Et si quaeratur de ramice aquosa in ouo, non est cum sanguine sed cum humoris aquosi: sed tamen generatio eiusdem est ex debillitate testiculi, et effunditur ad illum.
And occasionally it happens from a blow above the testicles.
And this moisture is having many colors. Or indeed the color of it is inclining towards citron-yellow, or it is bloody red, or it is foul, black, or it is watery white, and it is that which is most.
For if it is in the white scrotum that we said before, then the ulcer is round, somewhat long like the shape of an egg; and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on every side.
And if the moisture is in its own scrotum, then the ulcer is round with an egg-like part, and because of this man estimates that there is another egg.Et si est in testiculo, tunc est longus et tenesmus habet ad urinam.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it falls under the sense.
When therefore you wish to know the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the ulcer with a square introducer, whose shape precedes it.Et si quadratum intrare per imperationem non possit, et est quod resistat intra se et praetergat omnia, et cadat sub sensum, et tunc scis quia est aggregatio aquae inter testiculos sub sensum.
Accordingly, when you are introducing the trocar into the opening, judge the depth of that which is within.
When then you come to the cure with the iron, you must order that the sick person be bled if possible and see his body filled.
Then he should be laid on his back on a high object, and place many sheets under him.
Then sit on his left side and order the attendant to sit at his right side who should extend his scrotum to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles and to the lower part of the navel.
Then take a wide spatula and cut the skin of the testicles in the middle along their length up to near the white membrane; and the incision should be according to the straight line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the membrane, and peel it and examine it; or beware lest you cut into it: and your peeling is on the side that hangs with the egg more; and examine carefully with the peel as much as possible for you.
Then pierce the white membrane with a large hole and extract all the water.Cum ergo excoriationes fiunt per latera testiculorum et per partem inferiorem uentris, cum excoriatione quae est super rem, per totum suum longitudinem inter testiculos, et per partem superiorem eiusdem uentris, et cum parte quae suspenditur, uidesque illam tibi ad modum ouoli. Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend it to the top, and do not touch the skin encompassing the testicles: and cut the scrotum in any way that you can cut it, either entirely or partially, especially its thin side.
For if you do not search out carefully, there is no safety in the incision that water will not return.
But if it protrudes outward from its skin at the time of your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the scrotum, draw it back.
Then unite the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.Et si quid superest de cuti testiculorum: reseca eam.
And if there remains anything of the skin of the testicles: cut it away. Then treat it as other wounds until it heals.
If you find the testicle corrupt by any other blackness, then you ought to tie off the vessels which are the suspenders, fearing a flow of blood.Nam si tu non liges, et non fies cauteria in ouo: tunc peribit ouum, et peribunt testicula cum eo.
Then cut off the testicle with its suspender and extract the ovum; after that, take care of it as we said above.
If indeed water has collected in two parts, then you should know that there are two branches; therefore, cut the other part as you did the first, equally.
And if it suits you so that the operation is one, then do so; then wipe away the blood.Et ostende illi quod uiderit, et tangat et sentiat, si possit, et tantummodo uideat et sentiat: fac enim, ut possit bene sentire.
And show him that which he sees and touches and feels, if he can; but only sees and feels: for you must make him feel well.And insert into the incisions wool saturated in oil, or rose oil; and put outside another wool which you have submerged in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles, and massage his belly: and place on top double cloths, and are little sacks: and tie them on top with a ligature, which has six according to this form.
Then take two cloths and sweat them, and fill them with wool dyed red, according to this similarity; and make ends which are pressed from the cot, or with wet wool: and they are gathered with a girdle in the lumbar region of the arms; and one end takes over the anus up to the back, and the second takes to the part of the breastbone; and two ends below over the two thighs, and two ends on the other side above the two groins, and the whole girdle is gathered in the lumbar region of the arms.
And whenever it is artificially treated with a cautery in the place of the incision with iron; and it is, so that you take a thin knife, and cut the skin of the testicles; and it is heated, according to what we have described: until when it is removed white vinegar containing water; then take the cautery, according to this form.Et postea cum eo medicas ramicem, secundum quod diximus de scindendo ramicibus: et facias in ea liueream, ut diximus.
The letter A is assimilated.
Then pierce it with that needle and keep it burning until all the moisture has evaporated.
Then extend the needle with tweezers and scorch with a fine cautery, and cut it according to what is possible for you, until you have removed all of it.
And be careful that the egg does not touch the fire.
And you should know that this operation is safer and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with cutting.
If, however, it causes you difficulty at the time of cutting or cauterizing a hot ulcer or blood flow, or something else: then you should treat that which is causing you difficulty with cure as is appropriate for it, according to what has been stated above.
But if the sick person is fearful and does not hope for this operation because of its horror, then administer the piercing according to what I narrate it to be, and he will recover.
When you have established to yourself through that which we said about the meaning, that the splinter is watery: then you must make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.Et tenens manibus pedes eius, et cum lano perfora locum quod ad te uenit per illum quod apud te est ramex aquosa.
Then pierce the ulcer in its lower part with a broad spatule, and place the piercing according to the length of the body, and let it be an ample opening until all the water runs out.Et super illum ponas ligatura quod tenet per illam aperture, et trahe illum usque ad sedem eleuatam: donec currit aqua.
Then place a bandage over the spot and tie it up and let the remaining water run off; then treat the wound until it is healed.
But if there is an obstruction to the flow of water when you pierce it and this is due only to a white membrane obstructing the wound and preventing the exit of the water, then you must insert a needle into the wound or a tool like that used for draining water from hydroceles, as described earlier, or add a little something else to the treatment of the wound.
And you should know that the water returns and accumulates again after six months or so.
When it has accumulated, then it must be drained a second time and the invalid will take a few more days to recover.
¶ On the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Chapter 63.De ramice carnosa qui superuit in corporis humani parte qua libet.
You should know that in the dissection above the ramus is from fear leading to harm in many preparations.
Therefore it seems to me that letting go of it is saved from it.
And I am remembering the operation in it, and the appearance of the ulcer.
Therefore, I say that many ulcers occur in bodies from which the testes are formed: and it is caused by many causes, namely. Or from acute superfluity, or sharp, which is poured out to the testes.Aut de causa frigiditate uitia multum in eadem parte, qui perlongum tempus habet.
Or from the cause of coldness faults much in the same part, which has a long time.Or from percussion.
And the color of the ulcer is according to the color of the body, and there is no pain to it: and the ulcer is heavy.Et si sit apostema in testiculo aut in scrotum, et non possit per longum tempus esse in ea, sed debet perire, videas quod fuit causa.
And if the ulcer is in the testicle or scrotum, and it cannot be for a long time in it, but must perish, you see what the cause was.And perhaps the ulcer is stony, whose color is brown, and there is no feeling to it.Et si fuerit apostema in testiculo et est dolor in ea, et non posset esse perlongum tempus, sed debet perire: videas quod fuit causa.
And when it is from the knoting of the arteries, and their inflation: as has already been remembered by him: or from the inflation of veins.
What therefore is from them from the inflation of arteries, is known through the preparation of the ulcer, when you compress it with your fingers.Et quod est ex uenarum inflatione, et debet perire: et cognoscitur per uenam qui effluit in ea.
And you must not touch it at all.
However that which is produced from the swelling of veins should not be dispersed by compression with fingers. And now it is possible that an incision may be made over this spot and over the other flesh; and it is as though you were cutting the skin of testicles.
Then raise the testicle up and draw it out with a white ligature; and free the suspensory from the veins, and ligate the veins; and cut through the suspensory after you have freed it from every part from which it is attached.
If then the testicle is fused with those born flesh, then you should draw out the testicle and cut it. And if there is an adhesion between anything in the scrotum or in that which is between the veins, then you should free the whole adhesion and cut it with a round incision.Et postquam tu liberas ouum cum suspensorio, et uasibus, incide super illud carnem: nam non oportet ut quaeratur quid sit carnis super ouum, sed oportet ut incidas totam eam carnem in unum locum, ne resicatio carnis uel fustigatio carnis ueniat ad oua.
And after you have freed the testicle with its suspensory and veins, cut off the flesh on top of it; for there is no need to look at what the flesh on top of the testicle is, but you should cut off all that flesh in one place so that the cutting or slashing of the flesh does not come to the testicles.But if there is a birth of flesh at the site of the adhesion behind it, then you must cut through all of it and draw out the testicle as we have said. When then your operation is complete, fill the wound with wool dipped in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.And when the testicle has healed you may return to your work.
¶ Of the cure of Warts which are with Warts.
Head LXIIII.¶ De cure Ramicis qui sunt cum Vite.
A wart is an inlaid ulcer, similar to a wart, with the softening of the testicles; and it occurs difficult over the weak movement and exercise, and walking.Et faciunt se debiles et stuterosos per ambulationem.
And in the cure of this disease there is fear on account of that which preceded it.
But we ought to say that an operation ought to be performed on her according to what was done by the first. I say therefore, that it is necessary for you to cause the patient to sit upon an elevated seat.
Then make a transversal cut with a broad and acute spatulum across the scrotum until the sacs are exposed.
Then scrape off all parts, as we have told you in extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.Et cum spatulo exscindas cutem omnino, usque ad os pubis et super os ilium.
Then cut it off with a spatula beyond the ilium to the sides and above the head of the testicle, until you have completely removed it; and make sure he does not feel any pain. Then cut it off in the middle with a straight section according to the length of the body, and draw out what is collected from filthy corrupt moisture.Et fac ut sedet super sedem eleuatam: et habeto uasa quae sunt apud os pubis, usque dum sint ad extremitatem eiusdem sellae: et trahe illa ad se cum spatulo, et extrahe ea a cutibus.
Then let him sit upon an elevated seat; and hold the sacs which are by the pubic bone until they reach the end of the seat; and draw them towards you with a spatula and draw them out from beneath the skin. Then cure the wound with the cure for other wounds, in which there is the generation of pus, so that the sacs which nourish one testicle may fall away.
For it is not a bad thing through this.Et si post haec fit dolore, et ueniat ad extremitatem: et sentiat dolorem in omni parte corporis: et non possit dormire propter dolorem: fac ut accendat tummio uim queque dies iterum et iterum, donec cadant uasa quae sunt infra testiculum.
If it happens that the testicles are attached to all of the scrotum, then they should be removed along with the scrotum so that the testicles do not lack nourishment due to the incision and waste away or become inflamed and are not able to mature.
On the treatment of intestinal worms Chapter 65
That is why the intestines descend from that rupture down to one of the testicles.Et quare in vico intestinali, non faciunt clysteres.
And this rupture is either from a wound, or from its extension.
And these two types occur for many reasons. Or from a blow. Or from a fall.Aut ex vicio intrinseco, ut putriditas & infiammatio. Or from an intrinsic vice, as in putrefaction & inflammation.Or from noise.Aut ex passionibus animi, ut timore, laetitia, amore, dolere, &c. Or by elevation of the thing heavy, and similar.
And a sign when it is from extension, is lifeless.
It is what happens gradually in a long time and does not happen suddenly: and it is an ulcer equal to the verso deep; therefore, that sifach compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it when it is from a section of the sifach, because it makes the pain happen suddenly from the beginning of itself; and it is an ulcer different, appearing under the skin and close; and that is due to the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sipach.Et si post dolorem uel post signum ex sectione sifachi apparet apostema uersum profundum, propterea quia non est exitus, sed comprimit intestinum: et quilibet ex his signo est indicio sectionis eius.
And if after the pain or after the sign from the section of the sipach there is an ulcer that appears verso deep, because there is no exit, but it compresses the intestine; and each of these signs is an indication of its section.And sometimes it comes out with the intestine a zirbum: and this is called intestinal ramex, and zirbia; and sometimes it happens with windiness.Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zimbulem: et est indicio peritonis inflata, si ego non erubescens et subcutaneo uel subcutaneo apparet, quia ego sum peritonis inflammata, et non ex intestinorum inflammatione, ut aperiens suppurat.
And sometimes feces flow into the intestine and are retained there, and this is harmful to the patient, because it causes pain beforehand, especially when pressure is applied.
And in the cure of this disease there is danger from the iron; therefore it behooves that the case be handled with caution.
And the manner of the operation is, to command the patient to bring back the intestine by his hand into the hollow of his body, if it resists return.
Then he shall lie down on his back between your hands and you shall raise up his legs.
Then you shall extend the skin which follows the skin to the upper parts, and cut through all the skin of the testes lengthwise.
Then fix hooks at both lips of the slit according to what you need in order to open the slit with them; and let the slit be according to quantity, so that an egg may come out from it.
Then peel the scrotum and what is under the skin of the testes until when it is stripped of its white covering, hard from every part; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testis, in that which is between the white covering, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second covering, and complete with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Then move with your right hand towards the interior of the skin of the testes; and with this extend the white covering upward with your left hand, and raise the egg with the white covering toward the part of the slit; and command the minister to raise the egg upward; and you loosen the adhesion which is behind by completing the solution.
And seek with your fingers lest there be anything there of the intestine in the hard white covering.
If, however, you find something there, then push it back into the abdomen below.
Then take a needle with a thick thread made from ten threads; and insert it at the last covering, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testes which follows the slit; then cut off the ends which project out of the thread until there are four threads.
Then cut some of them over some with a figure that is in the way of a cross: and bind with them the alsifach, of which we said, because it is under the skin of the testicle with a strong ligament, until it cannot send any of the fluids, which nourish them to them anything: so that a warm ulcer does not occur from there.
And put again the second ligament outside the first ligament, distant from it by two fingers.
And after these two ligaments let a length of the alsifach remain under the skin of the testicles equal to the magnitude of a finger; and cut off the rest according to its roundness, and take away from it an egg.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles a section from which blood and pus flow, as we have related in what precedes.Et postea ponatur in medio inter haec duo ligamenta resectum testis cum suo tunica, et dispunatur inter illa ligatura, quae sint extra cutem: et superponatur altero testis similiter.
Then apply a pad soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the bandage that we described.
And sometimes the white cautery which we mentioned is used after the incision of it out of fear of blood flow.
For this happens many times.
And leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then warm water should be poured on it and put over it what we mentioned until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with remaining treatment of wounds until it is cured.
Of bleeding nettle.
Chapter 166.
IN this nettle I have not seen anyone dare to use the cure with iron over it.Et si faciatur ad modum quod diximus, non uitur ferri ad finem quandam.
And if it is made as we said, it will not take iron to a certain extent.The first ones indeed said that which is done as we described for nettle which is with grape vine.Et si uelletur in uino, et applicetur super eam, et embrocetur cum oleo oliva, per III dies vel IV, cadet per se.
That is, ligate the vessels after cutting over it with ease beneath; then dry in the middle, and finally take care with what opens it, until the vessels fall; and care for the wound, as we said, until it heals.
About disruption which happens in the groin.
Chapter 67.
When rupture happens in the groin as we said before, and something protrudes out and does not go down to the testicles, and if it goes down, it is little, and returns every hour; but when time is prolonged with it, fissure is added in the scrotum, until intestines descend into the scrotum.
And it happens from extension of the scrotum which is in the groin, as we said.Et si non placet ligare, sed debet uti olei: et sic curatur sicut diximus.
And if it is not desired to ligate, but one should use oil; and so the wound is treated as we said before.That is because the scrotum is extended; then it softens, and an abscess forms at the site, and protrudes out.Et si non placet uti olei, sed debet uti faturis uiris et melle: quia multum curat locum illum.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as the narrative of its predecessor.
And sometimes it is treated with iron in this way and it is so that the invalid lies on his back between your hands.
Then dry the site of rupture of pustules and protruding, cutting across the width according to the amount of three fingers.
Then squeeze the abscess and what is under the skin until when it becomes clear that the white substance that follows it is under the skin.
Then take a probe and place it over the prominent place of the abscess and press it into the depth of the abdomen.
Then pierce two prominent places above the end of the probe from the abscess and connect one with another with a suture: then extract the end of the probe.
And do not cut the abscess at all or stretch it, neither an egg nor anything else, as I made you know in the cure of intestinal worms. Then cure it with the cure of wounds.
When therefore you pierce the thread, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is healed.Et postea cura eum cum cauterio, sicut praeceperunt te.
And then cure it with a cautery as you have been instructed before.For Sisacha is contracted and the突出 place of rupture is not added.
And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to safety.
Of the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Head LXVIII.
Many times the skin of the testicles becomes soft in some men, because of which the flesh between them softens and its appearance is spoiled.Et ista mollitas testiculorum est multotiens causa libidinis.
It is necessary for him who is asked to heal this wound, that he lay the sick man on his back and cut away all the skin which has been softened over the natural skin. Then let him sew together the two lips with a seam; and if you will, he should first of all remove the superfluity of the softened skin by means of three or four stitches, and then make a firm seam.
Then cure the curing of the rest of the wounds until they are healed and the threads fall out.
¶ On castration. Albucasis: Book IV - Surgery.
Chapter LXIX.
Know that castration is forbidden by our law; and on that account I ought not to remember it in this my book; and the remembrance of it is not necessary except for two reasons.The first is, that it may be known who can and ought not to do it; and the other, that if any one has done it, he may know how he is to heal him whom he has castrated, and not kill him.
One of these reasons is that it may be known by the physician when he is asked about it; and also that he may know how to heal him on whom it has been done.
And the other reason is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our food by means of it, such as rams, horses, and similar animals.Et quod superius dixi: non est licitum de ea loqui in libro: sed bene est loqui et docere cum non curat medicus alium ad faciendum eam: nam si illum debet curare postea, qui castravit, scit quo modo debet curare.
I therefore say that castration is done in two ways. Or by attrition.
Or by fissure and section.
But in that which is done by attrition the way of operation is this: that we cause the animal to sit in hot water, until his testicles become soft and slack, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are dissolved and do not appear under the touch.
But in castration by fissure and section, you must hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.Cumque sentieris quod sunt appressi ad invicem, et non possunt fieri amplius flexibiles, tunc tibi est incipere incisionem per medium testiculum, et per totam eius length, donec pervenias usque ad eorum fundamentum, ubi est quasi adherens ad scrotum.
And this mode of castration is better than that which is done by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something in the testicles, wherefore the animal desires copulation.Sed in illa per fissuram et sectionem nihil detesticulis relatio est, sed omnia eorum exantlantur.
But in that by fissure and section nothing is left of the testicles, but all of them are taken out.Then heal the wound until it is well.Et sic est castratio fiata.
And so castration is done ¶ Of the cure of the Hermaphrodite in two ways.Primus modus utramque relationem tibi habere debet de hermaphroditis, et quomodo curari possunt: id est namque cum testiculis et ova in uno corporum genere.
Head LXX First way you must have both accounts from the Hermaphrodite, and how they can be cured; that is, when there are testicles and eggs in one body.Cum vero testiculi solum sint et non ouum, nec e contra quando ouum solum sint et non testiculi.
But when only testicles exist and not eggs, or on the contrary when only eggs exist and not testicles.The Hermaphrodite from men is according to two ways.Secundus modus est quando hermaphroditis habet testiculi et ouum in uno corpore.
Second mode is when the Hermaphrodite has testicles and eggs in one body.One of them is female, because it appears in that which follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between two testicles, a figure almost like a woman's vulva, in which are hairs: and sometimes urine runs from that which is in the skin of the testicles.Et quia et in uulua mulieris et in hermaphroditis est simul ouum et testiculi: et quia cum illo habemus relationem hermaphroditis facit utrumque, et generat filios et filias.
And in women there is one kind only, which is the clitoris, situated on top of the pubic bone just like a small man's testicles projecting outward, one of them being like a man's penis and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of the three kinds, two of them in men and one kind in women is that you must cut away the added flesh until its pressure is released.
Then cure them with the cure of other wounds.
Indeed the second kind of men, from which urine comes out, and that is located in the skin of the testicles, has no operation, nor any cure at all.
¶ On the incision of the tentige, and of the flesh protruding out in women's wounds.
CHAPTER 61.
A tentige is added over the natural organ, until it becomes dirty and its appearance becomes ugly; and sometimes it becomes magnified in some women so that it extends just like in men, and penetrates to intercourse.
You must therefore hold the overabundance of the tentige with your hand or with an hook, and cut it off; and do not go too deep in cutting, especially in the root; so that blood does not flow.Et si superfluitatem non potes tollere, sed tamen debet effugi impressio: excide ad latera carnem, donec impressio euge.
And if you cannot remove the overabundance, but yet its pressure must be released; cut off the flesh to the sides, until it is released. Then cure it with the cure of wounds, until it heals.
But the flesh that arises is the flesh which grows in the opening of the womb until it fills itself; and perhaps comes out to the outside according to the similarity of a tail, and because of this some call the first illness a tail-illness.Et ego video quod multum est in illo similitudinis caudae: et si non esset in ea similitudo testiculorum, non esset peruenio carnis ad coitum, neque ad concupiscentiam, nec esset illic dolus.
It is necessary, therefore, that we open it as we would a boil, and treat it until it heals.
On the care of the ratite membrane which is not perforated.
Chapter 72.
The ratite membrane is such that it is not perforated in a woman or there is a small hole.Quam cum aperitis, si uideritis quod foramen est parvum, ut possit puluere alratico seruii, puluiem illum inhaerenti in forame.
When you open it, if you see that the hole is small so that the membrane can be served with ratite powder, then use that powder on the hole. And it is either natural or accidental.Si uulua alratica naturalis est, ueniunt ad eam primum menses post partum: sed si accidentalis est, cum puluere alratico seruii post diem secundum curabitur, donec discessit puluus et sanguis ex ulcera.
If the ratite membrane is natural, the first months after childbirth come to it; but if accidental, it is treated with ratite powder after the second day, until the powder and blood depart from the ulcer.Accidental it is from the disease which preceded: and indeed it comes about either from added flesh, or from a ulcer, or from a pimple, and happens either in the depths of the matrix, or on its sides, or on its upper side, or on its lower side; and prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation.Et quod in ea est sanguis et puluus, si non curatur cum puluere alratico, conuertitur in ulserem mortuam: sed si seruitur cum puluere alratico, discessit puluus et sanguis ex ea.
And what is in it of blood and powder, if not treated with ratite powder, turns into a dead ulcer; but if treated with ratite powder, the powder and blood depart from it.And its knowledge is made by the aspect of the obstetrician, if an obstruction is apparent nearby.Si uulua alratica est naturalis et non aperitur, impedimento illi est in partu: sed si aperitur, impeditio discessit per foramen illius.
If it is not apparent then seek for it with your fingers or with a stick.
But if the hair is fine and is close to the two lips then quickly and pull it out.
And it is so that you put on top of the two lips some powder.
Then put the fingers of your two hands together and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread out.
Then stretch the two lips firmly until the fine hair is torn and the pubic hair is exposed.
Then take wool, soak it in oil, and put it on the spot, and let the woman do this every day so that the spot does not harden by being rubbed by another person.
But if the hair is coarse and thick then it is necessary to cut it with a wide spatulum like a myrtle leaf.Et si mulier non potest aperire labia suas, quoniam multum doluit: tunc oportet ut ducas eam ad termas, et facias illic de sيفach subtili.
If however the swelling is of new growth in the flesh then suspend it with hooks and cut into it: and have present remedies which check the flow of blood without biting such as the gum of the acacia tree, dragon's blood and thistle milk mixed with white vitriol.
Then insert a large lead pipe so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it there for several days; and administer linseed oil, then cure the rest with the usual cure until it heals.
And sometimes a growth in the flesh of other flesh is born: it is therefore necessary that they be cut according to this mode: as long as there is no cancerous ulcer for if there is a cancerous ulcer in the matrix, there will absolutely be opposition with iron.
¶ On the cure of hemorrhoids, Athelail and red beet are good for the warts of women.
Chapter 73.
Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of the veins, until a great deal of blood flows out of them continually.Et per eorum naturam debent esse in medio inter ueterem et rectum, sed non semper in eo statu manent.
When therefore hemorrhoids are hardened, they become thorns; and I have already spoken of their kinds and signs, and here I will speak of the remedies for them, and of those that have none.
I therefore say that there is no cure with iron for hemorrhoids which are within the matrix and do not appear to the sense.
But those of them which are in the opening of the matrix, upon which falls the sense, are they that are cured.
It is therefore necessary to admit the woman into a cold house.Et facias eam sedere super sella frigida, et facias eam bibere aquas frigidas.
Then extend the hemorrhoids with tweezers or with rough cloth, and cut them off from their roots.Si autem cadant in domum calidam, et in sella calida sedet, et aquas calidas bibit: non debet extendi athehelil cum forficibus nec cum panno aspero, nec incidi eorum radices.
Then powder over them at the site of the blood flow from an incision without biting: as with acacia, dragon's blood, and myrrh, and similar to these.
Then he drives his feet against the wall for one hour.
Afterwards lay her in cold water.
If the blood flow continues then have her sit in a decoction of sumach and皮and gall nuts and similar things.
Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make an ointment with it over his back. Postea induto eam vestibus laxis, et fac ut dormiat.
Then dress her in loose clothing and have her sleep. If the blood flows with it that is good; and if not, apply leeches to his back and breasts without scarification.Et postea confice unctionem cum oleo, et galbano, et melle, et stibide, et fac ut fricet dorsum suum cum eo: et ubi coagulat sanguis, tum scissura.
Take then a piece of wool and soak it in the juice of taraxacum, or the juice of arugula, or the juice of wild thyme, i.e., aglanther, Pontic wine, and apply it to the wound.
When then the boil is quiet, then treat the place with ointment, until it is healed.
But barth is red like heads of garlic and has an astringent appearance.
You should therefore cut away what appears on it, according to what I said about the lilies evenly; and treat it until it is healed.
On perforation of the uterus which occurs in the womb.
Chapter 74.De perfornatione uteri, qua ex utero exuitur foetus.
Many species of boils occur in the womb, like cancer, and a stone boil, and ulcers, and adubelati, that is, herpes, aisthmus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadia, and lilies, and a warm boil.And these are the names of the boils which are in the womb:
And indeed I have already spoken of all these diseases and their kinds and their signs and their cures in the book; it is necessary for me to say in this treatise about a hot boil which occurs in the womb when it is from boils which collect pus, and you should know how its opening is made with an iron.Et si in matrix apostema calidum non perit, sed pernicit omnia quae sub eo sunt, et uenena uirtutem suam omnia perdunt; nam si ferri in eum uigintiquinque partes diuidatur, et super eum deponitur ut uiridem faciat, uel post aliquot dies uel post quindecim uel aliquando iterum post quindecim dies, non perit sed uenena uirtutem suam pernit.
And if a hot boil in the womb does not die out but destroys everything underneath it, and its poisons lose their strength; for if iron is divided into twenty-five parts, and applied over it to make it green, either after several days or again after fifteen days, it does not die out, but its poisons lose their strength.You must therefore consider.
Then if the pain of the boil at its onset is acute with beating, and flame, and fever; and you see it red: if there falls on it a feeling, then you should not hasten with its opening; and treat it with what helps against maturation, until when the acuteness of the accidents subsides.Et si uides in apostematibus quae super uentrem sunt, et utero, eorum scilicit quae cadunt sub eo: nam sicut uides supra, sic cadit et infra per omnia loca.
Then you should make the woman sit on a seat that has two cushions, and she should recline or lean back on her back, and draw up her feet to her lower abdomen; and her hips should be spread, and she should place her arms under her knees, and tie both with a suitable ligature.
Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and apply the instrument to open the opening of the womb.
The form of which comes next in those who are after her.
And it is necessary when you wish to apply this instrument, that you insert with the rod the depth of the womb of the woman: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and harm the weak woman.
But if the instrument is more than the depth, then you must place cotton wool on top of the roof of the womb depth: so that the entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb is prohibited: and it is necessary to place the winding-sheet, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side; and to hold the instrument, and for the assistant to turn the winding-sheet until the depth of the womb is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by hand, and is smooth and soft, then you should make an incision in it at the head with a wide spatula.Et si non possit apparere exitura: sed est dura et rigida: tunc oportet ut sedam uel apodem facias ad pedes mulieris: et facias, quod stet in pedibus suis: et perges inter pedem, et facies linchinam ad caput eius: et alites de latere suo.
When therefore the matter is discharged, then it is necessary to put on the wound a piece of linen dipped in rose oil; or in green oil, in which there is some astringent quality; and put on the linen and extract the incision deeply into the matrix.
And put outside over the matrix, and over the comb clean wool dipped in water, in which have been boiled pease.
Then let it be cured after two days with ointment which is fit for it, until it is healed.
And whenever the matrix and wound are washed, so that they are cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which has been boiled the root of lily, or long aristolochia; then return to the ointment.
If the wound was hidden inside in the matrix, then it is necessary that you abstain from curing it with iron, rather cure it with what we have said above, in division.Quamvis autem matrix ueniat ad latus alium, et absque ulla curatione, cum ferro vel aliis medicinis, debet curari donec sanetur: sed quandoquaque lavatur, praestet quaedam medicamentum quod diximus.
A treatise on midwifery, how to treat a child born with its body in an unnatural position.
Chapter 76.
The obstetrician must first of all be aware of the natural position of childbirth.
From these signs you can tell that when you see a woman pushing from below and desiring to breathe the air above her, and being encouraged over her in relation to childbirth, and the exit of the embryo is hastened: then you know that this childbirth is according to nature, and its exit is over his head, and the afterbirth with it, or suspended or hanging by the umbilical cord.Et si habebit hanc figuram, quod super caput eius est, et secundina cum eo, uti diximus: nam si post partum uel post primum exitum eius, non possit aliter egredi de matre, nisi quod medicamentum de manibus Obstetricis tenens, ad super caput infundat per canalem narium: scias quod iste partus est contra naturam. And if it has this position, that it is above its head, and the afterbirth with it, as we have said: for if after childbirth or after the first exit of it, it cannot otherwise exit from the mother unless the obstetrician holding the medicine in his hand infuses it over her head through the nostril canal; then you know that this childbirth is against nature. When therefore you see these signs, then it is appropriate to compress its belly so that the child descends quickly.
Whoever is beyond this birth, is unnatural and unpraiseworthy.
For sometimes the foetus goes out on its feet and out comes its body before its head and its feet and its hands together, or one of its feet; or out goes its head and its hands; or out goes its navel: and perhaps it is turned over on to its neck and similar unnatural figures.
It is necessary therefore that the obstetrician be wise and subtle in all these things, and beware of error and deception; and I will show every figure out of them, and how it is disposed in them, and what is signified by it, and what will be done to him who stands on it.
When the foetus goes out on its head by its natural egress and it causes pain to her and makes her delivery difficult, then let her sit down on a seat, or let women hold her; and let the vapour of the bath enter her womb with cooked fennel and with moist oils.And if there is any difficulty in delivering the head, let them do this: they shall take a linen cloth and soak it in the water of a warm bath, and wring it out, and lay it on the head; then shall they apply to the head the band of an iron ring which has been heated over coals.
Then let the obstetrician thrust between his fingers a small spathe of parlour-grass and find with it the navel and cut it with her nail until she feels something moist within; and press the womb of the woman until the foetus goes down.
If it does not go down, then the woman should be cleansed with a mucilaginous preparation of fennel, mixed with sesame oil.And when it has gone down, let her sit in the bath; and if she cannot be delivered while sitting, then let her lie on her back.
Then tell her to squeeze after the enema and make her sneeze with pepper, and hold her jaw and nose for an hour at once.
For the foetus will come out right away.
If, when it comes out, two hands of the foetus come out first, you must pull them back slowly and easily.
If it does not yield on the entry, then put the woman above a seat and lift up her feet upward; then strike the seat against the ground; and hold the woman so that she doesn't fall over from the striking.
If the hands do not come out and the fetus dies; then cut them in and bring out what is left of the fetus; and tie up its hand with cloth, and bring it out in the same way; for it will come out.
The delivery of a child upon its feet.
When the fetus comes out upon its feet, then it is necessary to push them upward; afterwards turn the fetus over little by little: then equalize it.¶ Exitus infans super pedes suo.
Then take one of its feet and stretch it out gradually.
When they come out to the thighs, then tell her to squeeze and make her sneeze with pepper; it will come out if God wills.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then bring the fetus back little by little, until you put him according to his natural form.¶ Exitus infans super pedes suo.
For he will come out then with an easy exit.
If it is prevented with all that we have said; then take mucilage of alder-bark, and oil of sesame-seed, and gum dissolved: and beat the whole in a mortar with a good beating; afterwards anoint with it the womb of the woman, and the under part of her belly.
Then make her sit in tepid water until she gets the chills.¶ Exitus infans super pedes suo.
When you see that her lows are already warmed, then make a suppository of myrrh for her.¶ Exitus infans super pedes suo.
When therefore she holds one hour, then cause her to sit upon a seat.
Then cause her to sneeze: and press her jaw and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with easy compression.
For the fetus will come out immediately.
The delivery of the fetus is on the knees and hands.
When it comes out in this form, then she will insert her hands little by little.
Then the woman is laid down on her neck, and let her feet hang down to the bottom: and she lies on a bed, and bends her hands.
Then press above her belly gradually.
Then draw out what is under her feet from the sheets, until she is ready in the lower part.
If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them with a violent motion.Et si tamen non egreditur, deinde resupine fac eam iacere in puluini, et resupinetur super collum suum: et presset alius uentrem eius et pedes eius compressione vehementi, donec egrediat foetus.
Then press what is above the hypogastric region little by little until the fetus ascends upward.
Then insert his hands and adjust the fetus little by little; and order the woman to compress it until the fetus comes out.
The exit of the fetus hanging widthwise from the hands.
Let him use his hand for reduction.
If he cannot reduce it, then lift up the woman and make her walk around.Et postea iterum recumbere.
If she cannot walk, then let her lie on the bed; and strike her thighs with a vigorous blow.Et postea iterum recumbere.
Then apply the liniment which you have prepared from mucilages.Et fricta cum eo, linteo puluere.
If she experiences uterine contractions, then let her sit on a seat.Et concute crura eius concussione uehementi: et praecipito mulieri, ut ne quaestio uelationis non deserat.
And strike her thighs with a vigorous blow; and order the woman not to relax at all.Then try to reduce it with your hand, and adjust the fetus according to its natural shape; and make the woman sneeze, and order her to compress herself until it comes out.Si autem non potest egredi, tunc eleua eam super crucem: et praecipe ut non relaxet in aliquo.
If it cannot come out, then lift her up on a cross; and order her not to relax in any way.The exit of the fetus over its neck, with its hands spread out, and its face turned towards the back of its mother.Et postea recumbere: et intromittat manus suam in ostium illaqueet pedes foetus.
Then lie down; and insert his hand into the orifice and grip the feet of the fetus.The midwife should hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it, and adjust it with ease.Et postea eleuat ostium uteri, et praecipe mulieri, ut relaxet: et stude in reductione pedum foetus, donec egrediatur.
And then lift up the uterus, and order the woman to relax; and try to reduce the feet of the fetus until it comes out.When it is equalized, then place on its navel that which we mentioned above from oil and mucilages.Et postea recubuit super latus suum: et ostendens ostium illaqueans pedes foetus, fac ut relaxet.
Then she lies on her side; and showing the orifice gripping the feet of the fetus, let her relax.Then order her to move little by little.Et postea stude in reductione pedum foeti: et facit ut relaxet, donec egrediatur foetus.
When you have done this, then let her sit on a chair and order her to lean to the right side.
Then order her to press down: and make her sneeze with the snuff.
The exit of the prepared fetus on the side.
When it comes down to the opening of the womb in this way with the afterbirth, then split the afterbirth with your nail until it is evacuated from moisture.
If therefore it hangs on the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not held back, and die.
Then push the fetus back inwards until you put it as it should be: and order the woman to press herself several times: for he will come out with a light exit.And if you see any of its limbs hanging out, cut them off.
The exit of twins or many fetuses.If therefore there be twins joined together by their chest and navel, then separate them from one another; because it is not lawful to kill a living soul for the sake of another.And put aside the one that comes first, and take care to bring forth the other one safely, if possible.
Know that twins are often born: and sometimes three or four are born.If you see two heads in the womb united together, cut them asunder; because it is not lawful for two to be born together.And put aside the one that comes first, and take care to bring forth the other safely, if possible.
However, this is strange and rarely happens.
However, five is something outside of nature, and they do not live completely: and the afterbirth contains them both, although they are multiplied; and they are separated by a membrane that separates between them, tied to each one's navel.And when they are brought forth it is necessary to cut off the navel.
And sometimes they come out as one comes out by a natural exit, easily: and they come out by an unpraiseworthy exit, as we have narrated.Now let us speak about the exit of a fetus that is dead or nearly dead in the womb. If some of them are difficult at childbirth, and they come to that which we said from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have narrated: and let the midwife be subtle, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and adapt according to every figure with it that which is prepared for her from the leading sense towards health.And if there is any difficulty in the exit of the fetus, cut it into pieces to bring it out, so that it dies not in the womb.
Sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and now it has been verified with me, that a woman having an abortion gave birth to seven, and another to fifteen, all of them formed.
Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore all this ought to be in the science of Midwifery.Et quia multi non possunt intelligere Latinum, sed tantum Arabicum: propterea feci Latinam versionem, et Arabicam cum ea. It is possible that this could pass on to it something similar to itself; therefore it should be opposed to it with what is appropriate.
On the removal of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus as I have said in the division concerning medicine and it does not emerge and you are compelled to use surgery with the hand, then you should think about the following: si sit intra placentalem et non potest egredi, extrahito placentalem cum foetu.
If it is within the placenta and cannot emerge, remove the placenta with the fetus. If then the woman is of sound strength and has not any of the conditions from which there might be fear of loss over her, then let the woman recline on a bed, on her back, and have her head inclined lower and her legs raised up, and let the midwife hold her by two parts, or let her be tied to the bed so that her body is not drawn out as the fetus is extracted.
Then moisten the bone with oils moistened with marshmallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed. Then the midwife should lubricate her hand with these oils and mucilages, and then insert it into the mother's vagina with ease.
Then she should seek out the position of the hooks from the fetus, and the appropriate positions for this.
Therefore consider then , if the fetus is ready to descend over its head: then fix the hooks into its eyes, or into its neck, or into its mouth, or onto its palate, or under its beard, or onto its sternum, or in places near the ribs, and under the hyoid bone.
But if however it is descending over its feet then into its breastbone and the middle of its ribs.Et si parum est laxum, ut non possit cum facilitate per vaginam descendere, subveniat Obstetrix manibus suis: et sic illum extrahendo.
And you must hold the hook with your right hand and put its curve between the fingers of the left hand; and you must bring it forward with ease, and fix the hook into some one of those places which we mentioned, until it reaches the empty object.
Then let it be extended by equal contraction, and not just in a straight line, but moving to every part so that its exit is eased; just as is done with a tooth in the extraction of it.
And one must soften the extension in what is between them.
If a part is being held back from it then the Obstetrician must anoint some fingers with oil and insert them on that side to turn around what is being held back.Et cum digito uterque manum teneat, et per omnes partes intromittant, donec rem moueat, et faciat eam, ut in locum suum redierit.
If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then the hooks are changed to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
If therefore a hand goes out before the others, and it is not possible to bring it back, on account of its constriction: then one must wind a bandage over it.
Then draw it out until the whole comes out; cut it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow; and so you must do with the other hand and the two feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or there is a constriction upon it as it comes out, or there is water collected in its head; then one must thrust between its fingers the S-shaped hook called "Spathumile," and open up its head with it, and draw out the water: or he should burst it open with the instrument which is called "Almisac"; of whose form mention comes with the forms of other instruments in the chapter which comes after this.
Likewise let him do if the fetus is of a large head; then one must cut it with an instrument called "misdak," as we have said above.
Then draw the bones with pincers.
But if the head comes out and is constricted at the furcula; then it should be opened up until the humidity which is in the chest is poured out.Quod si apud claviculam coartatur, et non possit egredi: tunc findatur sicut diximus.
If however it does not yield and does not come out, then cut off the head, as much as you can.
If however there is an ulcer under the belly, or dropsy, then one must pierce it so that moisture can flow out of it.
But if the fetus is above its feet, then the delivery will be easy and the passage through the cervix will be gentle.
But if it is stuck at the belly or chest, then you must pull it out with a cloth that you have wrapped over your hand, and press on the belly or chest until what is inside flows out.Si autem non exituet per os matricis, sed per inguina: tunc oportet ut trahas eum per inguinam, et findes inguinam: donec exit quod est in eo, et ueniat ad locum seu ad naturam suam.
But if only the head is delivered and other parts remain inside, then the Obstetrician must insert her left hand: and press on the belly until what is inside flows out and comes to its proper place.If however the arms are removed but the head returns again, then the Obstetrician must push it up with her right hand, and press on the chest: If however the neck of the uterus is open then insert her hand into the uterus, and seek out the head with it, and pull it up with her fingers until it reaches the neck of the uterus: then she should insert a hook in the head, or two hooks, and pull it up with them.Si autem caput est obtusus, et non uadit ad os matricis: tunc oportet ut findes eum super manum tuam, donec currat quod in eo est, ut uadere possit ad os matricis.
If the bone of the pelvis is constricted because of a hot ulcer that has occurred there, then one should not work on it; on the contrary, one should then apply poultices of moist things and fatty substances, and apply plasters, and sit in baths which soften and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to turn it over; then what we said about the live fetus should be administered.
If that is not possible, then it should be cut a little and extracted.
And one must not leave any of the afterbirth inside at all.
When you have finished your operation, then administer what we said about hot ulcers which occur in the pelvis.
If there is bleeding, then let him go down into astringent baths and administer the rest of the cure.Quod si fluxus sanguinis non cesset, sed persistat, ut ante diximus: tunc oportet ut incidas in aliquo loco aliter, et trahas ad illum locum, et trahas iterum in locum prius inciso.
If the bleeding does not stop but persists as before: then one should cut elsewhere, and pull towards that place, and pull again to the first cut place. And indeed I have seen a woman in whose womb a dead fetus was; afterwards she became pregnant by another man, and then another dead fetus died too.
It happened to her a long time after an ulcer in her navel, and it swelled up until it opened, and she began to emit pus.Cum ergo viderunt medicus et levita istum fluxum sanguinis non cessare: comeiunt ad eum homines boni dicentes ut non dimitteret aliquid ex secundina intus; sed ille dimisit totum.
When the physician and the levite saw this bleeding not stop: good men came to him saying that he should not leave anything of the afterbirth inside; but he left it all. I was then called for her cure, and treated her for a long time: but the wound did not heal.Et intus in utero suo habebat foetidam materiam quae non poterat emittere: et mortua est ex eo.
And she had a putrid material inside her womb which she could not emit; and she died because of it. I placed therefore on it some strong atractive poultices, and the bone came out of place.
Then she passed a few days, and another bone came out.Et cum esset quasi in fine mortis, posui super os quod exierat emplastra atractive fortiter, et traxi eum ad locum priorem, et ligavi eum: et contremit omnino uterque os.
I wondered about it, since there is no bone in the belly.
So I thought that they were bones of a dead fetus.
So I examined the wound and pulled out many bones while the woman was in a better state; and she has lived like this for a long time, and only a little pus comes out of it now.
And I did not wonder at this because there is knowledge about it and a remedy for it administered by a skilled physician with his hand from the cure.
CHAPTER 20 On the forms of instruments necessary to extract a fetus
[77] HEAD OF THE INSTRUMENTS NECESSARY FOR EXTRACTING A FETUS.
Here below is the form of the constrictor, by which books are measured; it has two equal cords at both ends of two pieces of wood.Et forma altior est ad modum crucis latinae, quod non est necessarium in omni instrumentorum specie.
But the upper part is like a Latin cross, which is not necessary in every species of instrument.However, this vertigo must be thinner than the constrictor, and it should be made out of ivory or boxwood.Et post haec, forma est utramque parva et magna: et si non possit fieri ex uno ligno, aut ex uiso, aut ex ebano, utrumque faciatur ex uisum.
After that, there are two forms, one small and one large; and if they cannot be made out of a single piece of boxwood or ivory, then let them both be made from boxwood.And the thickness of each piece of wood is almost two fingers; and the thickness of both is about a finger, and their length is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood which are already glued to them, whose length is a palm and more than half; and the breadth of both is almost two fingers, or less.Et quilibet additamentum est quasi digitus, et latitudo eius quasi digitus: et sunt in medio duorum lignorum, quae praesentantur ad modum crucis in quibuscunque, utraque extremitate.
And these two ingredients are inserted into the mother's mouth so that when you open them they will release two vertigoes.
Form of vertigo, how it opens the uterus:
Other form is like that one, but more subtle and lighter:
Be made of ebony wood or boxwood according to the likeness of tweezers.
However at its end there should be two additaments as you see here above; and the length of every additament from them is almost a palm; and the breadth of both is two fingers.
When then you wish to open the uterus with it, then have the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down, and what is between her thighs spread open.
Then insert these two joined additaments into the uterus; and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with tweezers, equally according to the quantity by which you wish to open the mouth of the uterus, until the Obstetrician does what she wants.
Form of another vertigo which the ancients said was Form Impelent with which the fetus is driven:
Almisac form by which is crushed the small head: Form of Vncini having one spine.
Form of Vncini having two spines.
Form of tweezers which have teeth like a saw with which is crushed the head of the fetus.
Form of Spatumilis having two ends to cut off the head.
Form of two Spatumils also broad.
All these instruments are exercised, and the more they are multiplied in species, and prepared by the craftsman, the swifter to their operation, and higher with men, on account of their quantity.
Do not therefore despise that instrument, lest it be prepared for thee.
For their necessity is inexcusable.
Of the Extraction of a Secondary.
CHAPTER LXXVIII.
When the afterbirth is retained at delivery, then you must tell her to retain her breath.Et sic: Cum tamen veniat in extremum necessarium, quod secundina non potest de parte evelliri: sed praecipias matre, ut apud partum retineat anhelitum suum, et faciat omnia que possit ad expellendam ei secundinam.
Then cause her to sneeze with incense : and press your hand on her mouth, and nose.Et ita teneat anhelitum suum, donec velit omnia facere ad expellendam secundinam: nam postea non potest expelli nisi per mortem.
If it comes out through this hole, that is good.
If not: then take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid; and put into it herbs that open the womb, such as savoury, rut, dill, camomile, sesame, cassia wood, and centaury. Take all these herbs, or some of them, and soak them with water, and place them over fire.
Then place a reed-stopper over the hole of the lid of the pot, and the other end into the womb; and hold it there until the steam reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze as we have said.
Indeed, the afterbirth will come out with ease.
If however it fails to come out after this treatment; then instruct the obstetrician to soak his hand in castor oil or the mucilage of marsh-mallow. Then he should insert his hand into the womb and seek for the afterbirth with it.Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitati.
When he finds it then he should take hold of it and draw it out little by little. secundina enim egredietur cum facilita.
If however it is attached deep within the womb, then he should insert his hand as we have described until he finds the afterbirth and draws it out little by little according to its natural position; indeed, it ought to be moved gently back and forth from right to left; then attention should be paid to the degree of tension.
For it then resists, and is preserved, and slips away from adhesions. Postea subditur matrix in locum seu positum.
Thereupon the womb is restored to its former position.If however the os of the womb is contracted as we have already described; then treat it with sneezing and with the pot of herbs.Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitati.
If however it fails to come out after all that we have described, then beware lest you grow weary from repeating extraction.Quod si praecipies Obstetrici ut faciat iteratas extractiones, et non possit egredi Secundinam: tunc caue ne concidat matrix: quia non bene concitat post haec iterationem.
But it is right that which goes out at the mouth of the womb, you should ligate it to the hip of the woman.
Then cleanse her with an enema of tetrapharmacum ointment.
For this will putrefy her after a few days and be dissolved and go out.
However, when it putrefies, a bad smell is raised from it to the stomach and head and harms the sick person.
Therefore fumigations appropriate for it must be administered.
Indeed some of the ancients have already experimented with a fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.Quod cum fecerunt, odor ad illum redegit et adfuit.
Here is an illustration of the instrument used for fumigating a woman with retention of secundine and menses.Figur 23 (a).
Let the vessel be made of bronze or brass; and let its broad end be placed over the fire; and let the fumigation be placed above the plums; hold it there until that fumigation is consumed; then repeat with another.Figur 24 (a).
Of the cure of a non-perforated anus.Igitur post ea omnia, quando per tres dies aut quattuor ligatur, faciunt eam vasa quaedam adficienda ad illum.
Chapter 79.Here begins the treatment of a woman with a non-perforated anus.Thereupon after all these things when she has been ligatured for three or four days, they make certain vessels to be applied to her there.
Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which a subtle pus has already affected.Quamvis autem adficiatur, illum non aperiet: ergo faciunt fustem de uitro, cuius extremitas sit ampla, et ligantes eam per ligaturas illius mulieris, ponunt super ilium et affigent ad eum, quod in ea sint excrementum.
It is necessary, therefore, for the midwife to perforate it with her finger; and if not, perforate it with a sharp spatulate instrument; and beware of the membrane, lest she touch it.Verum si non possit aperiri, uti oportet de ligatura, quod in ea sint excrementa: et fustem ponat super ilium, et affigat ad eum: et illum fustem, per quaedam dies, habeat sub illo.
Thereafter place over it wool soaked in wine and oil.Et fustem ponat super eum adficiendum ad eum: et sic faciat iterum, donec aperiatur illud, vel donec exiit pus ille.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it will become encrusted, then put a lead pipe into the hole for several days and remove it when the boy wants to move about.
And now encrustation has occurred in Ani's wound also, from the coalescing of the wound or from a pustule.
Therefore that coalesced part must be cut away; then treat it with what we have said about treatment and lead. On the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower parts of the body.
Chapter 80.
Fistulas which occur in the lower parts of the body are a swelling and coarseness which occurs near the anus, or over a space of one area; and there is one fistula, or more.De curatione fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte et in ano.
When therefore this swelling becomes hard, it is opened and from it runs a white watery moisture or thin pus.Et quod est pernicies in ipso anus, faciatur cauterio.
And when there is a fistula penetrating into the rectum itself, a cautery should be used.And sometimes there are these fistulas going inside as well.Si ergo scieris quod penetrat in interiorem partem, faciatur cauterio perniciosi loca.
And they are from these, Fistulas, when they are in a space penetrating as far as the urethra and as far as the channel of the vermin.
And they are from these, penetrating as far as the junction of the hip, and as far as the knot of the tail.
And by this, also, is known the fistula penetrating as far as the anus, even when it does not penetrate, that you should insert your index finger into the anus; and insert a fine probe into the fistula out of bronze or iron when there is no tortuousness.
If, however, there is tortuousness in it, then insert into it a probe of fine lead, or a lance out of horsehairs, until you feel the probe, or the lance, with your finger.
If you do not feel it thoroughly, nor anything issues from the orifice out of evacuation, or belching, or vermin as I have said; then know that it is not penetrating: go therefore to the cure.
And when a fistula is penetrating as far as the urethra or the channel of urine: then its indication is an outlet for urine out of it and prevention from this that the place be consolidated with remedies.
If indeed it is penetrating as far as the junction of the hip, or the socket of the hip: then its sign is that a probe may enter all the way to there if there is no tortuousness in it up to the socket; and finding pain in going around the part, and what issues from it is pus always: and that it does not heal with medicine, nor consolidate with ointment.
And for all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure indeed; and the cure for them is labour and nothingness from foolish physicians, over whom it is formed. But in that which is not penetrating and not antique, there is hope of healing with an iron probe; according to what I narrate to you, and indeed I have already proved it: and it is that the invalid lies between your hands on his back; and you elevate his legs up to above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his belly.
Then he should insert a probe of lead or brass, if there is a bend in the fistula, until he knows where it ends.
If however you feel that it is weak around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel with your finger that the probe has already passed through the hole, apart from what you feel between your finger and the probe or flesh: then indeed you will know for certain that it is passing through; so do not trouble it, because its cure is not possible, as we have said.
They have nevertheless said that the flesh is cured in some men by a caustic fire subtile according to the size of the fistula, as we have already said, and you should insert it into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Then repeat this twice or thrice until you know that all the added flesh which is like a bird's feather-pipe has been burnt away.
Then treat it with soft bandages soaked in butter until the burnt flesh comes away; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
If it is cured, so much the better.Si autem non est curata, intra quod diximus: deinde cura illam cum aqua et lino, et terga fac eius: et si non poteris facere eam teneram per seipsam, fac terga eius et trahe eam ad te.
If it is not cured, then proceed as we have said; then treat it with water and flax, and make bandages for it; and if you cannot make it soft by itself, make bandages for it and draw it towards you.And if not, then it will never be cured with any other cure.
And if the probe comes out and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or skin between it and the probe; and you see the fistula following the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and scrape away with the probe as far as the probe reaches until the cutting has reached where the end of the probe is, and the probe is released and falls out.
Then cleanse these strained meats which are like the feathers of a bird, so that nothing remains in them.
If however the blood beats you and dissolves between you and the operation you are doing, then it is better to cut away those meats quickly with a sharp instrument, or to cauterize them with fire or with a caustic medicine.
For the cautery with fire brings about good results by the burning of those added meats and the stopping of the blood flow and drying up of the moistness.Cum igitur in primis incoepit sanguis esse sedatus, deinde cum igni cauterizat: postea ad animam reuertatur, et ad vivum rursus per uigoram calidam redit.
Then treat it with unwashed flannel in butter, or crushed cabbage, until the area discharges pus and the burnt flesh comes out into the pus.
Then treat the wound with ointments which generate hard flesh: and these are medicines in which there is astringency and drying.
For when they are restored, then it is healed: and you need not fear repetition. But if the Fistula has already penetrated to the depths of the anus and is elongated from the superfluity of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and probe with it.Et si sentieris aliquid durum sub digitum tuo, sicut grana frumenti: et non fuisset illa Fistula, sed alibi fuerit in corpore:
If then you feel a pulsation and there is between you and her a veil of skin or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then no operation can be performed on it except through the way of trust and hope.
Which is, because it is administered in it one of three ways: either that you cauterize it, as we have said: or incise it, until you reach its concavity, so that it may be possible for you to introduce a poultice and effect a cure from close at hand.
And do not go very deep with the incision, so that you do not cut the tendon which contains the anus, and the result of the operation be harmful to the invalid without his consent. Then treat it with what we have said. Perhaps it will then heal: or you will lengthen that veil and clean it after you have dried it up close to the anus, as we have said, either with a tent, or with some other sharp instrument.
Then cleanse the raw flesh which is in the incision, until you can reach it with your finger.
Then try to heal the whole wound with the incision, and the upper orifice where it is healed: and a fistula will remain open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the invalid.
And sometimes the fistula is like this: and it is, when you introduce a tent into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus, around its surface with skin and rim of the anus: then take a tent with a perforated end, which is like an aleskef needle, that is, a preparation of goat hide, in this form.
And insert into it an unwoven thread out of five threads, and around it.Et si non possit tollere tentum de Fistula: accipe fustem ad tentum qui est adpositus super eam: et trahe tentum usque in manum tuam: et intromitte in eam tentum alium utrumque ad modum, donec possis per eam intravertere licinium.
Then introduce the probe with thread into the fistula until it reaches its concavity.
If it is therefore penetrating inward at the edge of the anus near to the interior then draw out the thread from that opening; in such a way as you put your finger into the anus and pull out the end of the thread, and tie together its two ends; and press both [ends], and leave them for one or two days. And the more the thread pierces into the flesh, press it well until those flesh pieces which are between the two ends of the thread come together and fall away: then care for the wound until it is healed.
For there is no means for you to make this on account of the leg-bone so as not to cut into it.
Then do with it as we have said until it is healed.
The shape of the narrow-spined spathe with which the fistula is split, whose curve is very acute and the other part is not acute, so as not to cut that which does not need to be cut, as you see.Quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.
The suture of hemorrhoids from which blood runs out through the cutting of them and the cure of fissures.
Chapter 81.De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.
There are two kinds of hemorrhoids.Primus est secundum qualitatem sanguinis, idest rubris et virentibus: alius vero secundum qualitatem carnis, idest albis.
The first is according to the quality of blood, that is, red and green; the other, according to the quality of flesh, that is, white.For they are either within the anus, like pieces of coal or plums, or they are themselves like grains of grapes.Quod si intra anum sint, quae uirtute alicuius medicamenti per urinem exierint: illum tamen medicamentum non habemus, sed facimus incisiónem cum spatula, et suturam postea.
And if they are within the anus and come out by virtue of some medicine, yet we do not have that medicine, but we make an incision with a spatula, and then the suture afterwards. And from them there are small ones and great ones; blood always runs from them, and it is one or many.Et qualitas carnis est utrique eorum, sed non totus ille color, qui ex sanguine est: nam ex uiride, si quando non habet uiridem, est albida et rugosa, ut uides.
And they are outside the anus and at its extremities.
However, those which are outside the anus are for the most part few in moisture, from which flows a yellowish water or little blood with constant flow: and they are according to the colour of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is, as you shall order the patient to let it out: and it is pressed out, until the anus is opened, and they appear to you.
Therefore also suspend them with hooks; or hold them with your nail.
Then cut them off at their roots.
But if they do not hold in the hooks on account of their moisture and softness, then grasp them with a rough cloth, or with a piece of lamb's wool, and draw them out with your fingers.
Then cut them, and sprinkle on some hot powders after the cutting that they may stay in place as a cautery.
Or cauterize them according to what has preceded in the chapter on cauterization.Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.
Then cure them with the remaining cure until they are healed.And they are outside the anus and at its extremities.
If the anus does not yield to evacuation, then enema the patient with a small-toothed enema, so that he may be relieved by it of what is in the anus, and that it may yield to evacuation quickly when he forces himself.And if this does not help, put some oil into the anus, as much as a small walnut, with a syringe made from the horn of a cow or a goat; and let him lie on his back for a whole day until it is evacuated.
If, however, the warts are external to the anus, then their nature is slight and easy; and it is as if you were to grasp them with your nail, or grasp them with a hook and cut them.And if they do not yield to being held by hooks on account of their moisture and softness, then grasp them with a rough cloth or a piece of lamb's wool and draw them out with your fingers.Then cut them, and sprinkle some hot powders upon them after cutting that they may stay in place as a cautery.Or cauterize them according to what has preceded in the chapter on cauterization.And they are outside the anus and at its extremities.Then cure them with the remaining cure until they are healed.If, however, the anus does not yield to evacuation, then enema the patient with a small-toothed enema, so that he may be relieved by it of what is in the anus, and that it may yield to evacuation quickly when he forces himself.And if this does not help, put some oil into the anus, as much as a small walnut, with a syringe made from the horn of a cow or a goat; and let him lie on his back for a whole day until it is evacuated.If, however, the warts are internal to the anus, then their nature is difficult and intricate: and it is as if you were to take a sharp lance, and with its point, pierce the anus, and press hard until you reach the warts; and cut them off there, and draw them out.And be careful lest you pierce the bowel; but when you have reached the warts and have cut them off there, pull them out.And if they are numerous, then cut them in this way one by one.If, however, you cannot reach them with a lance, then take a sharp knife, and with its point, cut around the anus, and make an incision into the flesh of the warts as far as you can reach; and cut off their roots there.And if they are not numerous, then it is sufficient for you to cut them off in this way one by one, until they are all excised.
Then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And who shuns incision with iron, then you must administer their suture in this way.
Take the unwrapped thread and insert it into the needle.
Then pull the thread up to the top and make it go through with the needle at the root of it on the other side; and wind the two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be widthwise: and tie the thread tightly.
Then knot the thread and take out the needle.Deinde fac ut reseruentur, donec consunt.
Do this with all of the threads, and leave one; do not tie it to itself so that the superfluous blood will run out of it.
Then place over the wound a cloth infused with rose oil or cerote, and place it over the anus; and give instructions to the patient to rest.
Then let him go until he falls down.Et qui non posset de se sustinere per dolorem, et moreretur per dolorem, ille debet mori.
When therefore the athelils fall off, heal them with ointments and other healing remedies until they are healed.
On the treatment of fissures
For they often occur from the drying up of faeces and natural contraction.
When therefore they become old and medicine avails not on them, then one ought to rub them with points of Spatulis, or with your nail, until they become moist, and the upper cortex is taken away from them which hinders their being consolidated.
Then heal them according to what is fitting, until they are consolidated.Et sciatis quod si fiant fessae, et non possunt durare in situ suo: oportet ut ducantur ad loca calida, aut tepidaria, et curentur, donec redeant in normam suam.
But if they do not knit, then repeat the application of the cautery with greater force than before until there is much bleeding, and afterwards dress the wound until it is healed.
10. The treatment of wounds of the arm, both of those who are right handed and left handed, of Athelil, and of bees.
Then treat it as follows: and if you wish cauterize it according to what was said before, in its chapter.
From a wart there is one protuberance that is small, rough, hollowed out, and round above the surface of the body.
And they often occur on the hands of boys.
Its treatment is to stretch out the wart and cut it, or tie it with a silk thread until it falls off.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was said before, with fire or with a sharp medicine; and so warts are eradicated whether they are inverted or not, with an instrument that I will describe. An ant is also a small hollow protuberance, coarse and above the surface of the body, going very deep; and when it meets with cold, one feels in it a sensation like that of an ant's bite, and it affects the whole body: and it most often occurs on the hands.
And its treatment is to take a reed made of a goose feather or a strong vulture's feather; and place the reed over the ant until it encloses the ant within the circle of the reed.
Then roll your hand with the reed until you have removed what is around the ant; and then put it into the depth of the flesh, and you will eradicate the ant from its root.And if there are several ants next to one another, cut in between them with a sharp instrument until they separate, for if one ant remains you cannot remove the others. And if you wish, do this with an air or iron tube according to this form.
Let the upper part of the tube draw by its upper surface, a loose slanting line, so as to ease the pressure on the finger and its turning.Et quod ad faciendum est ut sit in medio cannulae et ambitu eius uacuatum, ut non obstat postea ad inuersionem digitus in eam.
And if you wish to cauterize an ant according to what has been said before about cauterization by Athaliel in the chapter on cauteries.
On the forms of instruments which are administered for clysma in diseases of the anus and for relaxing the belly and for colic.
CHAPTER LXXXIII.
A clyster may be made of silver or of brass or of tin or of copper.
And sometimes these instruments are small and sometimes large according to those in whom they are administered.
Therefore that which is administered for curing children or small people should be small and also the clysma for those whose anus is weak or painful.Et illud quod administratur in curatione ueterum, sit magnum: nam cum pueris administrantur, multum adflictione eorum crescit.
Large enema.
Small enema.
The cane or upper end on which the gut is tied should be large according to this manner and it should have a knob so that it can be bound just as you see it, and its lower tip which goes into the anus should be closed and smooth and very slender, made with great care; and on one side there should be two holes and on the other side one hole.
And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rods and not too thick; and there should be a gut in which they place medications from a sheep's bladder or from a lamb's skin, which is made according to the form of a small asafetida root whose length is one palm.
When therefore the gut is placed within it, tie it at its head between the two knots with a strong constriction.Et intra in anus facias uter perforari ad eam partem ubi est foramen singulum per unum solum foramen: et sic intra per omnia foramina: ita quod possit intrare et extrahere faciliter in eadem parte.
Then enema with it.
And this is the form of the circle as depicted here, and of the holes. The quality of enema with it is to fill the syringe or the tube with medicine which has been warmed according to the amount tolerated by the patient: and beware that it is not very hot, or very cold.
Then the patient is laid on his back, and he elevateds his legs to the upper part: and put under him a matress, that is, a skin on which men lie, or a sheet.
Then lubricate the end of the syringe with oil, or with white lead, or with mucilage of fenugreek, or similar.Et resupinetur super lumbos infernos, et intraret in eum clisteris sub capite suo: et retineat pro hora, vel pluris.
And he is laid on his lower back, and the enema is inserted under his head: and he holds for an hour or more. Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Then the assistant takes the syringe with both hands at the same time, and squeezes it with force until all that is in the syringe is evacuated into the intestine. Then withdraw the syringe, and let the patient elevate his legs to the wall.Et sic agatur cum eo de diebus pluris: et non de diebus pluris, nisi quilibet medicus viderit convenire. If medicine forces him to vomit, then he should hold as much as he can.
And if he sleeps with her the whole night, it is more dangerous for his life.
If you are using enemas to treat a swollen belly, and he rushes to evacuate his bowels, then give him repeated enemas until he is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful sores in the anus, then use a very thin and mild enema, such as is used on children.
And this should be the shape of the enema for a small child.
§ On the treatment of head wounds without fracture of bone.
Chapter 84.De vulneribus oculi cum fractura ossis.
I have spoken before of the treatment of wounds as it is set out in books; and now I will describe here a cure for them by hand and with remedies according to the supplement.
Therefore I say that wounds are distinguished according to the cause of the wound and according to its location.
The objects which cause wounds are often as if a stone were thrown, or a sword or dagger used to cut, or a lance or wood used to strike, or an arrow and similar objects.
Wounds which are according to the parts of the body are as if a wound were on the head or neck or chest or abdomen or spleen and similar members.Et quae fiunt super caput, sint sicut contusio, aut fractura ossis: et similibus ex eis.
And I am describing the cures of certain wounds in order to put forward that reasoning and rule for other wounds.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because an account of the composite ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say then:
When there has been a simple wound in the head and no bone is broken, then consider whether it was from the throw of a stone or something similar, and it has broken only the skin; and it is a large wound and you fear an adverse outcome because of a hot abscess, then quickly phlebotomize the head at once and do not delay it; and draw off blood from it according to its strength. If nothing is preventing phlebotomy, especially if there is little blood coming out of the wound.
And let there be bloodletting from the opposite part of the wound.
And he must avoid fullness from drinking and eating coarse foods.
But if something is prohibited by the bleeding, then it will be reduced from food, nor should one draw near to flesh nor wine.
And if there is a hot ulcer on the wound, then put on cotton soaked in rose oil only, or with wine that has astringency in it.
But if you are free from a hot ulcer, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood and the air has not yet changed it, powder which I will narrate in a little while; and if the air has already changed it, then put over it some ointments until it heals.
But if the wound is large, or is from the incision of a sword, and similar: and its lips are not brought together by threads, then bring them together with sewing, according to that which I will narrate concerning wounds of the belly about their sewing.
But if the wound has been revealed from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it except in a small bandage: then cut it open.Et sit uulnus uterinus, quod est extra osseum per uiridem, et non intra eum: et facias ad eam puluers, et unguenta, sicut ego narrabo post paulum.
Then treat the wound with medicines and restore tough flesh in its place, and prescribe to the invalid foods which are bulky, such as meat and cooked wheat, until it becomes like porridge, and similar things.
If you find that the flesh is putrefying and not adhering to the bone, then cut away all the putrefied flesh, throw it out, and then treat the wound.
If there is an artery or vein from which blood flows, and it cannot be cut away by medicines, then ligate the artery.
If you find that it has not been cut, then close it with a ligature or clamp it shut with a pin.
If necessity demands and this is not possible, then cauterize it so that the flow of blood is cut off.
A Recipe for Powder of Flesh.Take equal parts of pepper, white hellebore and salt, add a little rose oil if you will; then grind these up together in a mortar.
Take one part of incense, two parts of dragon's blood and three parts of unslaked lime; pound all together, strain it through a fine cloth and fill the wound with it, and tie it up firmly till it adheres well to the wound and congeals with the blood.
Then press it together on top with woolen strips, and let it alone so that it does not become loose while it remains there, lest it should come off.
For the medicine will not be eradicated from it until it has healed.
Then take care of them with the rest of the treatment, until they heal.
About wounds of the neck.
Chapter 175.
But if a wound happens to the neck, then there is no difference between its treatment and that of a simple head wound.
But if a nerve or an artery of the neck is cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it except to prevent its treatment with what causes violent constriction, like vinegar, and rosemary, and similar things.Et si arteria est uulnata, tunc debet esse deuoratio magna, et resuturatio, nec curat subligeat intra quod est nervus, sed in parte externa; sicut curat capitis uulnera.
Since they harm nerves and contract them.
And do not apply anything at all that is cold to a wound; for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is connected with the brain which is exalted above other members, and let that by which it is being healed be gently applied, as though an ointment made with lime lota several times infused with sweet water, or with rose-oil, and thuthia, when it is also washed with sweet water; and the other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer a suture; or keep its lips together with threads.
Then heal it until it is cured.Et quicquid est super uulnus, cum sutura curaturo omnino teneas: et quilibet nervus, qui in loco illo est, percutias, et non contendas ei: sed si quae res ad uulnum pertinet, percuties eam.
And whatever is above the wound, you should keep it held with a suture while healing; and each nerve which is in that place, prick it, and do not contend against it; but if anything appertaining to the wound is pricked, prick it.If indeed the wound is deep, or there occurs in its lower part a sinus in which pus has already collected, then pierce it in a more depressed place.
If indeed an artery is cut in the wound, and its blood flow continues; then separate it, or cut off its flow: or cauterize it if necessity drives you to do so.Quod uero est super, quod uulnus, et quod habet pus cum sanguine, et est profuso, et uisum est ad uulnum, cum puluillis contuses labia eius, donec facias percutiem in magis profundis eius locis: nam si percuties eum in superficiali loco, non curabitur.
If the vertebrae of the throat have already been split, or all of them, and the windpipe has been saved: then gather together the lips of the skin with a stitch above the cane of the throat, and do not touch the throat, but bring it back to its natural shape.
Then tighten it with a decent ligature, and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments containing astringent and drying agents until it heals.
If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then probe it: if there are pieces of bone in it, extract them all, or as many as you can; and what cannot be prepared, leave it until the wound putrefies, separates, and its discharge stops.Si autem uulnus non fecit impressionem in osso, sed in spondylis mellae, et putredine in spondylis gutturis: tunc extrahe mellea omnia cum putredine, ut putredinem disciant spondyles: et si quid in spondylis manet, perquire ut videas an exeo est.
If the wound has not made an impression on the bone, but on the soft vertebrae and putrefaction in the vertebrae of the throat: then extract all the soft matter with the putrefaction, so that the vertebrae are cleansed: and if anything remains in the vertebrae, probe it to see whether there is any exit.If the wound is recent, then sprinkle powder over it, as I described above.
If a bone is seen in the wound and there is a fistula: then treat it as I described in its chapter.Si autem uidetur spondylos mellae, et non uidetur os, sed putredine in spondylis gutturis: tunc extrahe mellea et putredinem, et pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui, et cura eam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.
[86] Of wounds in the groin.
If therefore there issues a puff of wind from the wound, when the sick man breathes, then know that the wound is mortal.Et si in medio est uulnus lanceae, et non egreditur ex eo sanguis, sed uelut hinnit, et si uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.
If there is no depth to the wound and it is still fresh with its own blood, do not put any powder on it from the first hour, nor compress it so that the blood does not pool inside it and return to the heart, thus killing the sick man; rather, apply an astringent ointment in it and let it work for two days.
But if you do not have the ointment at hand, then put a piece of dry cloth into the wound opening so as to suck up what flows out of it from the moisture; and let the sick man sleep on the wound so that what collects in it runs out.
But if three or more days have already passed since the wound and there has not yet happened to the sick man any spasm, nor bad trembling of the heart, nor constriction in his breathing, and you see its other signs are good: then know that the wound is sound.
Care for it therefore with bandages and other care until it is healed.
But if its healing is held up and it opens always, then know that it has become a fistula.Postea facis ei unguentum, ut praecepimus, donec sanet.
Thereafter you make the ointment for it as we have prescribed, until it is healed. So care for it from its head.
And if the wound is from a cut of sword or dagger and it is single in its surface on breast or back, then care for it with what precedes it out of sewing, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.Quod uero excidit ex illa parte quae ad os est: tunc fac primum suturam, donec sanguis stet et non fluat: sed postea soluto linteo tangas eam partem quae est apud os, et non in ea parte qua est ad dorsum.
But if it went out of that part which is to the bone: then do a sewing first, until blood stands still and does not flow; but afterwards, loose linen touching that part which is at the breast, and not in that part which is to the back. But if it already made an impression on the bone, and came off in splinters: then examine the wound, and hasten to take out those splinters, if they are separated.Quo autem modo facietis extrahenda illa frusta, quae separata sunt, etiam si non est cum ea puluere, sed solido sanguine velut croco: ut postea ponatur super eam unguentum uiri, et fieri ad modum, sicut praecedentibus, donec sanetur: nam in ea parte qua est ad osse, et quae habet frusta: facis primum uncturas super eam de oleo et galbano, donec fluant illi, qui sunt inter illa frusta, et disgregentur, et postea ponas super eam unguntis uiri.
If however they are not separated, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for their extraction will be alleviating.
As to other accidents of wounds in other parts of the body, the rule in treatment is that which we have already stated.
Of wounds of the abdomen and the protrusion of the intestines and their discharge.
CHAPTER 77.
The rupture which occurs in the abdomen is great, or medium, or small.
From a large rupture therefore sometimes the intestines will protrude, or a number of them.
Wherefore their re-insertion and their suturing are more violent and difficult.
And a small rupture is also caused in another way.
Therefore it follows that their re-insertion is more difficult if you do not hasten at once to return them to their place; for they are puffed up, opened and swollen, wherefore their insertion is difficult.Et uulnus inflatum non potest fieri ut introiat se ad locum suum: et quia fit illa inflatio in vico in quo est ruptura, totus venter inflatur.
And a swollen wound cannot be made to return to its place; and because that swelling is caused in the part in which the rupture is, the whole abdomen is swollen.That is why then a medium rupture is better than others; for with it the intestines are not so difficult of re-insertion as they are in these two kinds.
Know that the suturing of wounds is according to four ways.Utrumque enim fit per lineam et ex utraque parte: aut in medio quoddam puncto inter se iunguntur, et ad duas partes discribuntur.
For both are done across the line and from either side; or they join each other in a certain point in the middle, and are divided into two parts.Two common sutures agree in the suturing of the abdomen, and in the suturing of other wounds of the body: and two other sutures properly communicate with other wounds.Et sunt duo genera de his quae per lineam.
And there are two kinds of these that are across the line.However they are more proper with the suturing of the abdomen; and I will tell you one at a time, with explanation and declaration.Quare fit illa per liniam in uentro, cum ex duobus latis punctum quoddam prope inter se iungitur, quod non facit ut intestinum intrare possit locum suum: et postea inflatum est, et aperitur, et non potest introiri ad locum suum. I say therefore that when a wound is small and some intestinal matter comes out of it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it, then that is due to one of two ways.
Either because of the smallness of the disruption as we said Or because there is a swelling in the intestine due to cold air.
When then it is so, you should heat it by dipping a sponge or a damp cloth in warm water only.Et ponas super vulnera, et tenes, donec calore calefiat: postea resorbito.
Or you may boil squinanth, and cypress, and spike-lily, and embrocate with it the intestine until the inflammation is resolved.
Sometimes this wine which has astringency is better than plain water for resolving inflammation.
When therefore you see the inflammation resolved, then moisten the intestine with the water in which the alder or the mulberry was boiled.
For by this the entrance of it will be soothed with a small thing.
But if its return is not cured after this treatment, then find a little in the rupture with an instrument with which they cut off hemorrhoids.Et excidit intestinum et omne quod habet intrinsecus, et faciat introitum ad posteriora.
And he cut out the intestine and all that is inside it, and made an entrance into the posterior. And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than after the cutting, and there is no compulsion to cut after necessity and the defect of the instrument.Nam post sectio, quandoque facit urina rictus et lacerationem cum illo: et non debet ad sectum iterare.
For after cutting, sometimes it makes the urethra rupture and laceration with it; and he must not return to cut. Let one part of it be tortuous and acute, and the other part not acute, and let its slender end not be with subtlety like a spatula, rather be a little obtuse; and it is that which resembles chaff, as you see it.
When therefore the wound is enlarged and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its own place if possible, because it is better.Et faciat introducere intestinum ad loca quae debet: et non debet super illum iterare, sed facit ut sit uulnus cum intestino, sicut debet.
When indeed the rupture is large at the lower part of the belly, then you ought to cause the sick person to lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
And if it is at the upper part of the belly, then put his head and breast higher than his lower parts.
And likewise if the rupture is on one of the two parts of the belly, then always have your intent and consideration in this, that the part where the wound is be higher than the other part.
And so you ought to administer it in great wounds, and in middle-sized wounds.
But in small wounds let it be according as it is prepared for you. Nam si illam ponas altiorem quam debet esse, periculum est magis, ut inflatur uenter et crescant flatus.
Then have a trustworthy assistant hold the wound in his hand and press its lips together.
Then expose to him who follows one stitch after another; this is the mode of common stitching, one by one.
And it is to take a needle or as many needles according to the quantity of the size of the wound.
Then leave from the end of the wound a quantity of the little finger, that is to say, of the doctor; and fix a needle with thread in both ends of the skin, with two ends of the sinew which are under the skin, until you make it penetrate on the other side, and you have already drawn together the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the sinew: and they become four orders.
Then tighten with a double thread around the needle several times from both sides at once until they are drawn together the two lips of the wound decently.
Then leave off the thickness of the finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterwards draw it with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
You do not therefore cease doing this with all that are necessary until you complete the binding of the whole wound.
And let the needles be of medium thickness between that which is very fine and that which is coarse; for those needles which are very fine pass very quickly through the flesh; and those which are coarse are difficult to enter into the skin: wherefore they ought to be medium in subtlety, and not too coarse.
And it is not fitting that the needle be fixed in two places near each other in the end of the skin; so that the flesh may not be cut through quickly, and the wound opened before its healing, and that they may not be drawn out with the stitching also, so that the wound may not be prevented from healing.
Then cut the ends of the needles, so that they may not hurt the invalid during his sleep; and lay some small pieces of cloth from all sides which hold the ends of the needles, and leave them until you know that the wound is healed.
And this kind of suture with awls is more convenient for small wounds.
Because one, or two, or about that number of awls suffice in the suturing of these.
The second common suture is so that you bring together with the suturing of four ends: two ends of skin and two ends of silk in place of one, with an awl in which there is thread unraveled equal in thinness and thickness.
Then when you have pierced with the awl these four ends, return the awl from the part from which you began in order that the thread fall retarded from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture be as the suture of a cloth by which clothes are drawn together and place between every suture a quantity equal to the thickness of a little finger.
This then is the suture that men know.Et si magnus sit lacus et non possit per utramque suturam curari, et si uolueris omnes partes lacus suturare utrumque, fac sic: reseces cutem super lacum utrumque et sub lacum quoque et ad latera, ita quod una resectio sit ad extremitatem laceri.
And if the wound is large and it cannot be cured by either of the sutures, and you want to close all parts of the wound on both sides, do thus: cut the skin above and below and to the sides on both sides so that one cutting is at the end of the rupture.And with this suture I healed a wound which had happened to a man in his belly who had been wounded with a knife, and there was a greater rupture than the span of one hand: and there came out from his intestines about two spans from the middle of the intestine, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.Et cum hac sutura resecaueram carneam et conuertieram extremitates carnis ad uiscera ut esset carnis ad carnem: et resecaueram cutem super lacum et sub lacum et ad latera, ita quod una resectio esset ad extremitatem laceri.
And with this suture I cut the flesh and turned the ends of the flesh to the bowels so that it was flesh to flesh: and I cut the skin above and below and to the sides, so that one cutting was at the end of the rupture.Therefore after it had stood twenty-four hours I returned his intestine into its place.Et post iiij horas post quod ille homunculo resecauerat carnem et resecauit cutem utramque super lacum et sub lacum ita quod una resectio esset ad extremitatem laceri, et fuit sutura carnis in eadem quantitate sicut antea.
And after four hours after the little man had cut the flesh and cut the skin above and below so that one cutting was at the end of the rupture and the suture of the flesh was in the same quantity as before.The wound was consolidated in a space that was about fifteen days: and I cured it, and he healed: and he lived after that for many years, turned to his dispositions.
And the physicians judged that he could not be healed.
And by a miracle it was, that I did not heal that with ointment.
Because I was in a place where the ointment could not be found, nor any medicine.
I put therefore upon the wound old cloth moistened twice a day, and I continued to wash it with honey water, until it was healed.
But I will tell of two kinds of proper stitching according to the account of speech.Prima species suturae est in carnibus solidis et non tenues.
And it is, that you begin with an acute stitching: and you insert the needle from the outward to the inward part.Hoc faciendo non debes solvere uulnus ut inesse possit, sed debes intrauertire acum per carnem usque ad interiorem partem.
When therefore the needle pierces into the skin, and into that which goes under it according to the length and breadth of the whole body: let the end of the thread remain on the side where you inserted the needle, and make the needle pass through to the other end from the inward part towards the outward in the other end.Secundo itaque vertice ad extremitatem primam trahes ut intrinsecus et forniceter euntem; tertio vertice ad extremitatem secundam.
With the second end to the first end draw from within and without that goes under; with the third end to the second end.When therefore you have made it pass through, then let it pass through likewise in this same end from the outward part to the inward: and leave the end of the thread which is on that side, and make the needle pass through to the other end from the inward part towards the outward: and make it pass with your penetration as you make it pass into the other end, which is on the side, until it passes all through.Hoc facis donec sutura omnimodo per totum uulnus trahatur usque ad extremitatem aliam.
Do this until the stitching is altogether through all the wound from end to end.Then begin also from that same side and pull it with its end, which is from the thread on the other side, and draw out the needle from the skin where it pierced in.Faciant ergo medicos ut faciant suturam pro parte carnis, quae est ad extremitatem aliam, et ut trahat se cum sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in latere eorum.
Then bring it back into that skin and its end-piece, which is on the other side, with this end-piece mirach; and draw it out of the skin which is from its part, and make that one-and-a-half, and the other: and make that after the one-and-a-half, until all the outward according to that example.
And the sum of this sewing is that you sew the skin of the lips as they are lip-skins; so that you sew their end-piece one-and-a-half from one end of the skin: and that you leave it one-and-a-half from the other, until you have completed it.
The second kind of proper sewing, which Galen said.
This speech of his was narrated, so that he sewed it according to the similarity, as some healers are, so that they bring all parts together to their proper pair by nature; and apply the end-piece to the other end of it, and the mirach end to the other end.
And this is done according to what I narrate to you.
It is necessary that you place a needle in the end of the mirach nearest to you from the outside part, and make it penetrate to the inside in only that; and leave the two end-pieces of the sifac.And when your sewing has reached the end-piece of the skin which is towards its interior, then draw out the needle, and bring it back to sew the skin of the lip according to what I have narrated to you before; and sew it in the same way until you finish that end of the lip, and draw the two end-pieces close together.
Then turn the needle around, and make it penetrate from the outside part to the inside into the two end-pieces of the sifac, that is, on both sides.Et quando tua sutura pertingit ad extremitatem cutis quae est in interiori parte, erue acu m, et redde eam ad utramque partem, secundum quod antea tibi narravi: et fac eam ita suturam, donec perficias illam extremitatem labris.
Then turn both of them around, and also make them penetrate from the inside to the outside into the two other end-pieces of the mirach, which are on the opposite side.And when your sewing has reached the end of the lip which is towards its exterior, draw out the needle, and bring it back to sew the lip according to what I have narrated to you before; and sew it in the same way until you finish that end of the lip, and draw the two end-pieces close together.
And this mode of stitching is better than common stitching which is easy, and it is a stitch whose predecessor has been remembered.
This is therefore the speech of Galen as well.
And some have said:
Is corrected with a stomach stitch with two spikes.
That is, put the thread into both holes and start with the insertion of the needle, from that which is by you, and make it penetrate until the other side, according to their stitch who cure hides equally.
And you should know that when the disruption is in the middle of the stomach, then its stitch is more difficult than other places of the stomach.
Indeed, the judgement of the medicine of the wound, is the judgment of the rest of the wounds.
That is, when you pursue a fresh wound with its blood, before it changes it with air; and reduce the intestine, and its own, and fit it: then put over the powder ofincarnations.
And if the air has already changed the wound: then put over it some ointments, which are present to you, until they make pus; and fall threads, and heal the flesh, and mirach.
Then treat it as if it were a cure for other wounds, until it is healed.
But if medicines are not present to you, then put over it immediately, a cot of old cheese; and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
And if you fear that the wound will communicate to the principal members in injury, then it is necessary that you soak a soft linen in tempered warm oil, or in rose oil; and put it in the circuit of places which are between the groin, and under the armpits.Et si uulnus superueniat, et non potest sutari: tunc ponas super eum ligaturam, donec facias pacatum in quoque loco: sed quando pacatibantur loca: tunc remoues, ne creuent.
If he feels pain, or puncture wounds, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens) then give him an enema with astringent wine, black and tepid: especially if the putrefaction has already reached into the intestine, and has become a penetrating exit wound all the way to its cavity.
And you should know that what is from the large intestine has an easier cure; and what is from them is from the fine, a more difficult cure.
However, the intestine which is named the jejunum does not accept a cure from a wound that happens in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, what is from veins, and the magnitude of them, and because of the subtlety of its body, and proximity to the nature of nerves.
If however what proceeds from the wound is pus, and you pursue it recently: bring it back according to your reducing, as you reduce intestines equally.Et si punctionem facere non possis, et dubitas de illo quod est in intestino, ne quaesieris aliam punctionem faciendam in eo, sed uter stiptica quae habentur ad te, et faciat, quod debet.
If however it has passed a space for him, and is already green, or black: then one must tighten it with thread above the place which was discolored from that, so that blood flow does not occur.Et si putrefactio procedit postea de illo in intestino usque ad concauitatem eius: et facta est exitura penetrans, non debes facere punctionem illa locum per cui procedit putrefactio.
And if putrefaction proceeds afterwards in the intestine to its cavity: and has become a penetrating exit wound, you must not make puncture at that place through which putrefaction proceeds.For in pus there are veins and arteries.Et si faceres puncturas, posses facere fluxum sanguinis per illam locum ubi punctionem fecit, et possit mori homus per eam.
Then cut what is beyond that ligature, and place two ends of thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that you may ease its attraction upon you, and extraction of it towards the case of pus, and emission of pus of the wound.Et si non posses attrahere extracteurem ad casum pus illius ut debet propter subtilitatem eius: tunc debes trahere eum per ligamentos eius usque quod possit ire propter subtilitatem eius.
Remember the wound that happened in the intestine.
When there is a rupture of the intestine, and it is slight, then it is possible that in some men it be restored; therefore, because I have seen who was wounded in his belly with a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and it was an old wound, and it became a fistula, and there issued from it urine and flatulence.
Therefore I made a treatment for him, until I was not doubtful about his healing; and I did not cease to apply poultices on him, until he was healed and the place consolidated.Posuique super locum lintea: et feci ut pateres essent super eum applicati usque ad diem tertiam.
And I placed a bandage on the place, and I made that poultices be applied to him for three days.Afterwards when I saw that the place was already consolidated, I feared on account of the invalid, lest an evil accident happen to him in his belly; but that accident did not happen to him.
And he remained in better dispositions than before, eating and drinking, and having sexual intercourse, and he entered the bath, and exercised himself in his walkings.Et ego misit eum ad sua remansurum.
And I sent him away to his home.And some experienced men have already said that when there is a wound in the intestine, and it is slight, then one must tie it in the following manner.Et faciant fimbriam, et ligant eam super locum uulnus: et faciunt de ea lintea: et ponunt eam super locum uulnus: et ligant illam per omnes diemus donec consolitior fiat locus.
And you should take ants with large heads.
Then put together the two lips of the wound and place one ant on top of each lip so that their mouth is open across both lips.
When it crawls up onto them and tightens its jaws, cut off its head. It will adhere there and not loosen.
Then place another ant next to the first one, and don't stop doing this, ant after ant, according to the size of the wound.
Then pull it shut, and let it heal.
Indeed those heads will remain embedded in the intestine until the intestine is eaten and healed, and no harm will have befallen it utterly. And now it is possible for the intestine to be tied with a thin thread as well: that which was taken out of the animal's intestine, attached with it when it is put back into the wound.
And it is appropriate to take the end of this thread from the intestine and flesh it out a great deal.Et postea, cum fuit excarnatum, pone in acam, et ligatur eadem forma ut supra.
Then tie a thread of fine linen unraveled at one end.
Then insert that thread into the needle and sew with it.
Then return it to its dislocation. And this method of sewing with ants and intestines is only according to the way of trust and hope.Et sic fiunt omnia.
And so are all things. Know that a wound which is large and broad, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines: then there is no remedy except subtlety, nor is there any complete cure for it at all.Et si fiunt omnia secundum uiam, non est dubium quod uideatur bonum.
And if all things are according to the way, then there is no doubt that it will be good.
Chapter 78.Et in illo capite fiunt duo genera de cura: unum si ueniant per diuisionem, alium si per subtilationem.
And in that head there are two kinds of cure: one if they come through division, the other if through subtlety. Know that any wound or ulcer when it grows old and becomes aged, and becomes an ulcer, and always emits pus, and does not heal: then it is universally called a Fistula, and we call it a Zuchemen.Et ista nomine nomine nominamus quodlibet ulcus in membro quolibet quod non consolidatur, sed emittit pus semper et non abscinditur.
And by the name of Fistula we call whatever ulcer in any member that does not heal, but always emits pus and does not heal. And a true Fistula is a filtered knot, hard, white: with which there is no pain, and it has a concavity like the feather of a bird: and because of this some call it Risati, that is, a feather.Et propter concauitatem nominant eam quidam Fossa, id est Fossam, seu Fossa pennae auis.
And because of the concavity they call it some Fossa, that is a Pit, or the Pit of a bird's feather. And it is moist in some places, emitting pus.Et ista nomine nomine nominamus omne ulcus quod emittit pus semper et non consolidatur nec uelut curat omnino: sed est prope de finibus corporis.
And perhaps the moisture is split in some hours.
And sometimes this moisture is much, and it is little: and it is thick, and it is thin.
And I have already mentioned in the division, when I said wounds, that any ulcer which is not healed, and in which no flesh is born, is not [caused] by more than nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the fewness of blood in the body; or because of its wickedness; or because there is hard flesh between it and above its lips, preventing the birth of flesh; or because there is much filth and dirtiness; or because the ulcer in itself is putrid, and the matter that is sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for curing it; or because the corruption falling on the region is a kind of pestilence, or by nature in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where the digestion of diseases is made difficult, and the healing of pustules by nature is delayed; or because there is one bone in it, or a number of bones.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division; and it is fitting that here I should make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuqa, which is done by the way of operation with the hand.Et scito quod oportet te praeuiam operacionis bene mundare, et tota corpora tua cum aqua calida ut sit lumen super omnia: et postea faciendum tibi est peruiam illa apertam et patulam, et ut in ea uideas quae sint intra eam.
Know therefore that the Fistula happens in all parts of the body.Et cum accidit in capite, si est intra os et super os, non posset fieri per operacionem ut sit sana cum manu: sed cum accidit intra carnes et super carnes, et non inter ossa, faciendum tibi est peruiam illa apertam et patulam, et ut in ea uideos quae sint intra eam.
For from them are Fistulas which pierce to great veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews; or to the intestines, or to the ureter, or to any of the ribs; or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the joints composed by composition: as the hand and the foot; and from them are those which pierce to the nearness of the principal member, and to similars.Et cum accidit in capite, intra carnes et super carnes, peruiam faciendum tibi est ad uenas magnas quae perueniunt: nam si non possis ad eam, illa non potest sanari per operacionem.
Those who are affected by these fistulas in this manner have a difficult disease to heal and do not respond to treatment; their occupation entails hardship and ignorance.
If the fistula does not reach any depth towards those places I have mentioned and you hope for and believe in its cure and wish to learn about it, then take a probe of bronze or iron if the fistula extends straight; explore it with this.
But if there is a bend in the fistula, then explore it with a thin lead probe.Et ubi perueneris ad locum tenus, et in quo sentis dolorem, tunc scies quod ibi est mamma, quae necesse est dilui cum ferro, et tundere cum tentoria.
And when you reach the place that is most painful, then you will know that there is an abscess there which must be broken up with iron and pounded with a hammer. Since lead has the gentleness of its substance softened, and bent around the bend.Et si uenerit ad locum tenus in quo dolores non sentitur: et si perueneris ad locum quod est versus mediam partem corporis, scies quod ibi est exulceratio quaedam profunditas, quae necesse est tundere cum ferro.
And if you reach a place without pain: and if you reach the area facing the middle of the body, you will know that there is a deep ulceration there which must be pounded with iron. If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to show this with a probe.Et si peruenit ad locum versus caput aut pedem et sentis dolorem, et si speras ut possit curari: tunc scies quod ibi est mamma quaedam profunditas quaedam, qua necesse est tundere cum ferro, ut diluatur.
And if it reaches a place towards the head or foot and you feel pain and hope for its cure: then you will know that there is an abscess there which must be pounded with iron to be broken up. So, cleanse this opening from its openings.Et si peruenit ad locum quod est contrarius versus caput et pedes aut in latere quaedam parte eiusdem Fistulae, et sentis dolorem et speras ut possit curari: scies quod ibi est exulceratio quaedam profunditas quaedam, qua necesse est tundere cum ferro, ut diluatur.
And if it reaches a place opposite the head and feet or on some lateral part of the fistula, and you feel pain and hope for its cure: you will know that there is an ulceration there which must be pounded with iron to be broken up. For the moisture with which you cleanse it, seeps towards other openings and flows out from them.Et quod superest de ea closteriza uia cum tenia et uigila per noctem, donec tibi perueniat ad locum quod speras ut possit curari: et si non peruenierit ad eum sed tamen dolores remittentur, tunde illam secundum rationem curandi ulcerationes.
Then make a careful examination to discover whether it is a bone or a nerve; and whether the fistula is deep-seated or superficial; or, again, whether there is one fistula with many openings, or several separate fistulae, and locate it accurately in relation to yourself by the aid of your best light, and by questioning the sick man as to where he feels pain on pressure with your hand over the spot, and by similar signs and symptoms accompanying the abscess.
When therefore you have accurately located the true seat of the disease, proceed to treat it with confidence; and consider then whether the fistula is superficial and its opening apparent, or in a sound place remote from any joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the parts which I have mentioned to you: then open the fistula according to my directions, and take out all that is within it which filtrates and is corrupt, and all that comes from the flesh at its opening, and is like a boil; and dress the wound until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and runs straight, then you must cut it as deeply as you can.
Then cleanse it from all the corrupt flesh within it.Et si sunt ibi nerui, aut arteriae, vel uenae: ut non possit fieri secundum necessitatem, et periculum est praetereuntes, uel propinquos illos locos: et postea oportet mundificare carnes, quae crescunt in Fistula, et uti medicamentis, et ligaturis secundum rationem.
Then introduce lint smeared with strong medicines into the fistula as far as its depth permits; repeat this several times until the strong medicine has eaten away all that remains in the fistula from corruption.Deinde mundifica eam usque ad finem, donec concauitas tota uel omnino plerumque persolvitur: et postea fac ut sit apertio prolicita, et intromitte licinium, quod tibi placet, et oportet quod facias hoc aliquotiens donec concauitas tota peribit.
Then heal it with ointments that promote healthy flesh until it is healed.
If it does not heal through this, then cauterize it as we related earlier.
If the cause of the Fistula is bone and you are certain of it, then investigate it and cut into it as I have told you to do; if you are not prohibited from doing so by any vein or nerve or major limb as we have said.Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.
If you discover that the bone has something of decay and blackness in it, then scrape away at it until all its decay is removed.Then heal it with ointments that promote healthy flesh until it is healed.
Then heal it with that which causes it to be flesh until it is healed.
If it does not heal and continues to discharge as before then you will know that you have not removed all the decay.Secus tamen: si post quaestum emittat sanguinem et pus: et post haec, cum carnibus crescere incipiat: tunc restaura in ea locis quae vulnerata sunt, donec sanentur.
If it bleeds and discharges pus after being probed then you will know that the decay has not yet been removed.You should probe it again and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with your utmost strength.After this, when it begins to grow flesh, then heal in those places which have been wounded until they are healed.Then uncover it a second time and make an exquisite scraping and cleansing of it with your full strength.Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.
Then heal it.After this uncover it a second time and make an exquisite scraping and cleansing of it with your full strength.Deinde restaura ipsum.
If it heals then that is good. If not, then you will know that the decay is in a deep location of the body which you cannot reach.Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.Deinde, si necessitas imperat, fac in ea secundo cauterium, vel tertio, sicut necessitas sufficit.
If it heals then that is good. If not, then you will know that the decay is in a deep location of the body which you cannot reach.Then, if necessity demands it, perform cauterization on it a second or third time as necessity dictates.There is therefore no skill for you in this except to abandon it to nature.
If the decayed bone is small and you are able, pull it out with fine forceps that fit into that place.Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud: deinde restaura locum quod vulneratus es.
If there are many bones then draw them out with a very strong force and do not leave anything behind with your strength.
But if something is blocking you because of the moisture and there is no fear or mistake in the cut, then cut through the moist tissue, and if it is there free the bones.
But if you do not have the time to remove the bones then place something over the wound that will rot it and leave it until what is around the bone rots away from the flesh and moisture.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
And be bound to cut which you made in your operation.
If you fear place over it a linen saturated with oil of vitriols or linen saturated with Egyptian ointment, or any other viride ointments.
For when the moist tissues rot and separate from the bones, the removal of them and their draw will be easy.Et non tibi dubitet de auferendo quilibet os: sed videas primum si ueniat ad illud, qui faciat te dubitare.
If, however, the bone is a large one such as the bone of the thigh or the hip bone and similar to them, and that which is diseased in it is a large part: then scrape it with the final rasor until the blackness and disease are removed.
Then restore the wound.
If, however, that which is diseased in it is a large part, and the disease has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close it, and cut it entirely up to the place where the disease has reached: then cure it until it is consolidated.Si autem corruptio est in ossibus minutis sicut ossa manu, pedis, et similia illis, quia non possunt tolerare rasum magnam uim, tunc restaura corruptionem intrinsecus, et extrahitur intraueens ad medullam. If, however, the disease is in small bones such as the bones of the hand or foot and similar to them, because they cannot tolerate a great rasor, then restore the corruption within and extract that which has entered into the marrow.And I narrate to you a zuken, which happened to a man in his thigh: so that you put it as an example and aid over your operation.
There was a young man about thirty years old, who had pain in his thigh, because of that which moved upon him within the body, that is, from the intestines, until it reached the leg, and he had a great abscess: and there was no external cause for this.Et apostematum fuit tanquam lympha, et non fuit dolorosum, sed erat magni magnitudinis, et postea fuit sicut malum in crure suo, et putare quod uir illius esset mortuus nisi reseceretur.
And the abscess was like lympha, and it was not painful, but it was of great size, and afterwards it was like a mal in his thigh, and they thought that the man would die unless it were resected.So with him time was prolonged because of the mistake of the doctors until the abscess opened, and many materials came out along with it.Et quia non possent serrare intrinsecus, et erat malum totum intraueens ad medullam, et mortuus esset nisi reseceretur, resecauerunt ergo illum cum rasorio extrauendo omnia mala quae erant super crurem, donec uiderent medullam cruris, et serrarent, ut possit consolidare.
And a treatment for this is postponed until the leg is ulcerated and many openings are made therein; these all emit pus and the humours of the body.
And many physicians treated him for about two years, and no man who was wise in the art of medicine was found until I was called upon to see his leg; and the fluids which ran out of those openings were flowing strongly. Also the whole body of the man had withered away, and his colour was yellow.
I therefore made a probe into one of the openings, and it reached to the jaw-bone.
Then I probed all the openings; and found that they connected with each other all over the leg.Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis. And a treatment for this is postponed until the leg is ulcerated and many openings are made therein; these all emit pus and the humours of the body. And I probed one of those openings until I came to a bone; and found that it was rotted away, blackened and putrefied, and eaten through so that its marrow could be seen.
I therefore cut away what I had found, and prepared the rotten bone.
And I saw that there was nothing in the bone but this rottenness which I cut away.Et praeparaui quod essent orificia omnia clausa; et clausi eam partem cruris super os, et omnia orificia.
And I had the openings all stopped up; and I stopped up that part of the leg above the bone, and all the openings: and I had cut it away.
Then I applied to the wound restoratives which promote solidification over a long period.Et fuit ad me postea ille uir, et inueni eum valentem, et cruentatum crurum, et in toto corpore robustum: et omnia orificia clausa erant, et cruentata.
And the man came to me afterwards, and I found him strong, with a leg that was sound, and all his body robust; and all the openings were stopped up and healed.And it had not broken out again.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with remedies, and it was speedily consolidated, and healed; and this repetition of the operation and the incision upon it were not necessary except because of the debility of the patient, and the lack of endurance in him, and my fear for him on account of death: for he was threatened with evil in all hours from a superabundance of syncopateous evacuation.
He was therefore healed with a whole healing; and there came to be in the place of the bone hard flesh, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned, and he was turned into his own dispositions: and no harm at all came to him from contrariety in walking.
But if the protruding bone is already broken, then you ought to sew it according to this manner; and it is; that you take a thread, and tie it around the end of the protruding bone; and order someone else to stretch it up; and put another thread of wool thicker than the first one. Then you tie it over the flesh which is upon the bone; and stretch its end in order to draw the flesh towards below; and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to sew up tightly, so that the sewing does not harm the flesh.Et postea facies ligaturas circa extremitatem ossis: et detrahes carnem ad superiora, et super os eminens: et trahas ligamentum, ut serres carnem.
And afterwards you shall make the ligatures around the end of the bone; and draw the flesh towards above, and over the protruding bone; and draw the thread, so as to sew up the flesh. Place wood, or a board decently below the bone from beneath; for when you do this, the corrupt flesh is not prevented from being cut.Et facies sicut serras carnem super osse eminentio: et non debes linere locum sub ossibus: sed si periculum tibi videtur in corporis constitutione infirmitatis, et necessitas serendi: linere illum cum balsamis confortantibus, quos accipere possis.
And it is necessary that there be a little Locking over the rotten place, so that there may not be any rottenness in the hollow of the bone; and that it may not appear to the sight, and force the Locking to be applied elsewhere in its place. If the bone is rotten and not protruding, but continuing united with another bone, and the rottenness is in the middle or in a part of it, then uncover the flesh from all parts.
Then place a wooden splint below.
Then saw it from the first part where the rottenness is, until it touches the locking on the other side; and let the locking be according to the length of the rottenness a little way, as we have said.
If the rottenness is at the joint, cut the rotten joint, and saw the bone where it joins on the other side.Et sit Serratura ad modum crucis: et quod est super corruptum per serram, si non potest aliter fieri, frustra faciatur: sed si per serram potest fieri, bene.
If, however, there is corruption in the union of two surfaces then it can only be removed by scraping.
If the corruption is in the hand or foot then the matter is very difficult indeed.
It is right that you ask about the nature of the corruption.Si apparet quod est tamque corrumpe, quod non possit redimi: tunc debes mundi facere.
And you should scrape it and clean it according to the best arrangement that is possible for you and by any means whatsoever that can be rectified for you when it does not cause you contradiction with a Vein or Nerve.
And you should know that there are many instruments for cutting into bones according to the situation of the bones and their preparation and according to their grossness and subtlety and magnitude and smallness and hardness and rarity.Et ista instrumenta sunt multum in magnitudine, et pauca sunt in paritate: nam qui incidiunt ossa magna, necesse est ut sint magna, et qui incidiunt ossa minutam, necesse est quominus sint minutas, ut possint intrare ad locum necessarium.
And these instruments are great in magnitude and few in smallness; for those who cut into great bones must be great and those who cut into small bones must necessarily be minute so that they can enter the necessary place.Therefore it behooves you to prepare an instrument appropriate to every kind of operation.Et scias quod non debet operari per modum incisionis in ossibus subditis: sed debet operari per modum abrasionis, vel per modum cauterizacji.
And you should know that these operations indicate to you the appearance of the instrument which you will need when you have a long study with you.
And the knowledge of the ways of this art is a testimony of the ways of diseases; for then you will find by yourself that which suits him from instruments for every affliction.

§ On the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Chapter 89.
Extremities decay because of either an extrinsic or intrinsic cause.Ex causis externis: putrefaciens aer, si teneatur in loco clauso, et non fuit ventilatus.
When you have been treated for that corruption by medical remedies, and the treatment is of no avail; and you see the corruption affecting a limb which does not respond to anything: then you should cut off that limb up to where the corruption has reached, so that the sick person may be saved from death, or from the evil which is greater than the defect of the limb.
And the sign by which this is known is that the limb turns black until it is putrefied; either because fire has burnt it or because putrefaction has set in after blackening; and the putrefaction goes as far as the next joint, and spreads through the whole body.
Make haste therefore to cut it off, and the same course should be taken if the cause of the corruption is the sting of some poisonous animal, such as a scorpion, a sea-worm, an adder or similar creatures.
If therefore the corruption, or the sting is in the tip of the finger, then cut off the finger and do not leave any space for the corruption to go further into the hand.Si autem est in medio digiti: incide digitum medius inter duos articulus, et non des spacium corruptioni usque ad reliquas articulus.
And likewise if it happens on the hand, then cut it from the root of the palm, and do not leave a space for corruption, until it gets into the hollow of the arm.
And if it is sunken in, then cut the arm at the elbow at its joint. If, however, corruption has set in and you see it around the elbow, then the patient is dead.
And to do more than this in the way of cure is the limit of skill.
And likewise act with regard to the foot when corruption has set in the toe; cut it off then at one of the joints. And if it goes into the instep of the foot, cut the whole foot off.
If, however, it has ascended to the knee, then cut the leg off at its joint. Si inuit etiam, et non potest curari nisi crurem totum incidas, tunc incide totum.
If the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy for it except to cut it off and abandon the invalid to death.
And the manner of cutting off a limb, or of ligaturing it, is to tie the tendon in the lower part, which you intend to cut; and above the place, tie another tendon.
And the assistant extends one tendon towards the bottom, and another towards the top.
And you separate the flesh which is between the two tendons with a wide chisel until all the flesh is laid bare.Quod si corruptio peruenit ad medium membrum, tunc scies ligamentum superius et inferiora: et serras membrum: et lezas corium quod est intra duos ligamentos.
If the corruption reaches half way up the limb, then cut both tendons, and ligature the limb, and pare away the skin which is between the two tendons.Then it may be cut or ligatured.Quod si corruptio peruenit ad caput ossis, et non peruenit ad articulum:
And it is necessary that you put a linen cloth on from all parts and the scalpel should not touch the healthy place; and let the injury happen to the sick, and pustule become hot.
If however blood flow happens inside while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly; or put on some powder over it that stops blood flow.
Then return to your treatment until it is finished.
Then bandage the wounded member with a suitable bandage, and cure it, until it heals.Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.
And I tell you what happened to a man on his foot, the same thing happens that I am telling you.Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.
What is happening is that when he has blackness in his foot with a burn similar to fire, this rot first happened on one of his fingers until it spread to the whole foot.
The man therefore cut off part of himself after he saw that the rot was affecting his limb with its vehemence, and which he found from the pain and the burn; and he cut it off at the joint and he was cured.
And after a long time had passed for him, that same rot happened to him again on the index finger of his hand. He came to me and I tried to cure the excess with him with medicines on the hand after cleansing his body; and the excess did not return, and it began to spread to another finger until the rot spread to the hand.
He called me to cut off his hand; and I did not want to do it, hoping for the return of that excess from me; and I was also afraid for him about cutting his hand.Et cum incidisset manum illam, superfluitatem non reputauit, sed coruptio et mortis uenit ad aliam manum: et postea ad pedes.
And when he cut off that hand, the excess was not restored but the corruption and death came to the other hand and then to the feet.For the power of the medicine was greater than the occasion.
After he despaired of me, he returned to his land; and he came to me about him, for he hurried and cut off his whole hand; and he was cured.
And I did not bring this tale except that it be an aid over that which falls of this illness' kind; and that it be a sign by which it is recognized, and how it is acted upon.Et si quis inuitus est ad me de hac narratione, et non crediderit ei: post uidet factum illud per omnes homines.
And if anyone is unbelieving towards me about this tale, and does not believe it: afterwards he will see that deed through all men.
CHAPTER NINETY.Of the treatment of syphilis, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
When an ulcer occurs on some fleshy members and the space of the ulcer is prolonged until it makes a collection of pus: then it breaks, or is pierced, and what is in it comes out of the pus, and the place remains hollow as if it were a vat: and the skin which is over it is like a cloth which has been worn out: and it does not reach its end in corruption, nor presses on the jaw, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be called Sinus: and it is not called Fistula; however if the space of it is prolonged until the corruption presses upon one of these members, then it is called Fistula or zuken.Et si in quaestione quaelibet ex his membris, et non facit sanie, neque collectionem facit apostematis: sed corrumpit cutem suam, et manet quassura, et uacuum quasi sit spuriatus per totum locum: et non habet finem, donec perfora, aut rumpe, et effundatur in quo est sanie: et per totum iter eius non imprimit mortis nec corruptione: nominatur tunc Fistula.
And the cure for it is to cut away the whole skin as far as it has come loose; and especially when it has become thinned out like a membrane, and you are sure that it will not adhere to the place because of its decay.
If however you think that the skin will adhere and there will be no consequence from that last decay; and if there is thickness in the skin from the flesh, then the cure for it is with a cautery: and it is for you to consider the case of the sinus.
If it is large however, and the pus that comes from it has a foul odor; then cleanse the sinus with Egyptian medicine which is made of equal parts vinegar, oil, and zinc oxide, mixed in a vessel, and boiled over fire until the medicine turns red like honey. And let the patient take this mixture three times a day, each time a large spoonful.
Then take as much of it as you need, and dissolve it with water and honey, and cleanse the sinus with it; and tighten its opening, and let the medicine remain inside it for a period of two hours.
Then extract it with an expression, do this for days until the sinus is purified and the odor removed.Et si placeat tibi medicamen illud quod est factum de aere et mercurio: uide uti eo, quoniam proficit ad sinum mundificandum, et ad foetidum remouendum: sed non debes indurere medicamentum in Sinu multum diebus, ne per accidentem consumat carnem.
And if you prefer that medicine which is made from air and mercury, use it because it profits for purifying the sinus and removing the foul odor; but do not harden the medicine in the sinus for many days lest by accident it consume the flesh. And when you do not have this medicine at hand, cleanse with ashes of burnt wood, or ashes of holly wood; and throw these ashes into the water.
Then filter it, and cleanse with it until you are sure that the sinus is now clean.
If the patient is not tolerant of either the Egyptian medicine or water of ashes, then cleanse with water and honey to which some powdered zinc oxide has been added.
Or cleanse with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey to purify and wash; and wine makes the sinus adhere especially when it contains an excess of stypticity and dryness.
When you have done this several times and are sure that the corruption of the sinus is now removed, then cauterize it with what makes the flesh grow inside it.
And it is so that you take from the plaster of daphinicon; and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or cauterize it with certain remedies, and other ointments, of which properties I wrote in the treatise on ointments.
If the orifice of the sinus is narrow so that it cannot receive the cannula of the clyster, then widen it with a little iron; or put into it a piece of licinium wrapped in ointment egyptian, or in basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged.
And likewise if the orifice is also large, then draw together its lips with a suture; and leave in it such a quantity that the clyster may enter without addition.
And likewise if the orifice from which the pus runs is elevated to the upper parts, then dry it up in the lower place where it is, so that the pus may run out of it down below; for when pus is coarctated in the depth of the sinus, it hinders the flesh from growing there.
If it is not possible for you to dry up the sinus about its lower part according as you see; then endeavour to prepare the member by a preparation whereby the pus may run out of it with facility, according as it is prepared for you.Et postea ut facerimus Sinum cum eo quod generet carnem in ipso: et sic faciunt illud cum clisteribus qui faciunt nasci carnem in Sinus: sicut scripsit Abucasis in libro suo de cauteriis, et alibi.
And afterwards when we have made the sinus with that which makes flesh grow in it; and thus do they make it with clysters which make flesh grow in the sinus: as Abucasis wrote in his book on cauteries, and elsewhere.Endeavour not to retain anything of pus at all in it; and take remedies which are laid upon the wound, agreeing with that which you see.Et si uis quod non est bene curata: conare ut facias in ea clysterem cum oleo rosato et uino stiptico.
And spread them out on a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such quantity that it makes contact with the entire sinus.
Then with tweezers make an incision at the opening of the sinus hole, a little larger than the sinus opening.
Then spread a soft ointment on another cloth according to the quantity of the hole, and place it over the sinus, far from its opening, so that the pus exits from it; and do not remove the large cloth unless after several days at once.
The one, however, which is over the sinus opening, is the one which you move at every hour, so that what accumulates in it of pus exits; and in order that you may know whether what runs from it is a lot or a little, digested or undigested.
And when you examine the sinus itself again, consider whether its master feels pain in it or there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it or not.Et si post dies aliquos non uideatur in ea, quae facit in ea pus, aut est in ea dolus, vel in ea apostema: et dominus eius sentiat in eo dolorem: acceperisque panem lene et stragum subtegmen, et remoueres super eum positione proxima ad orificium sinu.
And when after several days you do not see in it what causes the pus, or there is no pain in it, or an abscess in it; and its master feels pain in it; take a soft cake and a linen cloth underneath, and spread the ointment over the cloth, placing it near the opening of the sinus.When, therefore, your treatment is extended thus, and you see the matter which exits at the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus is already adherent or approaching adherence; then loosen it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you loose the wound, change the cloth and renew the ointment.Quamvis ergo facias haec quae dixi tibi, et non remoueres super Sinus, nisi post dies aliquos: acceperisque panem lene et unguentum renouaueris: sic per omnes dies usque ad diem septimam vel octauam. If however it issues from the chest after a long space of time a thin pus, then do not despair of its adhesion for its recovery is at hand, for there are men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is tardy and there are those who act to the contrary.
If however it issues from the chest after many days an indigest pus, then know that the sinus will not adhere.
If then the adhesion of the sinus is tardy and its issue prolonged, let them add to the desiccating medicines true remedies, that they may be moist in their substance but dry in their virtue, as the unguent called dyafinicon when there is added to it the superfluity of oil of rose.
And from a little last addition which is for the cure, let it be taken so as to receive the unguent of dyafinicon and dissolved with oil of roses and sprinkled over it wine old equal in its substance.
Then make it up with that and use it.
And now it does the same action when there is not present to you the unguent of dyafinicon, honey, when you boil it until it thickens and you use that.Et praesertim tibi debet esse mel apium, quod est optimo genere ad haec, et debet facere eorum similia.
Or take myrrh and aloes and frankincense: rub all together, and powder it over honey while on the fire.
Then line over it a cloth and press it on the sinus; and line with honey which you have boiled until it is thick; and powder over it spices, and lay over it a cloth and press it.Et ut sit melle optimo genere apium mel, debet esse optimae qualitatis myrrh et aloea et olibanum.
And whenever it is administered in that long aristolochia and roots of star lily, and there is a lily: and flour of herb and cornflower.Et quandoque si non possit adhaereret sinus, et prolongatur res eius, facias ut debes, et exicces super eum medicamentum, sicut debet fieri de sinibus.
Use them simple, or compounded; bruise them, and sift them through a sieve itself; and powder it over honey as I have described, and use it.
If the sinus is prolonged and not cured by this treatment, then know that there is corruption in its depth; or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the cure of fistulas, according to what has been previously stated. Of the treatment of a boil and nail crushed, and the cutting off of the finger added, and the division.
Chapter 91.
A boil is an aposteme which is born under the nail of the hand or foot; and perhaps it is born in other fingers.
When therefore its matter is prolonged and neglected to be cured, and it becomes a boil with a hot boil; or it is corrupted, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts all of it, and perhaps corruption perishes into the bone, until there is a foul odor to it; and the extremity of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes dusky.
When then you treat it with that which we said in division, and its treatment does not help; then you should cut with iron all the superfluity which remains from the nail.Et facies ea sicut in incisione unguis factum est: et tunc curabis cum oleo et aqua rosata, donec corrumperit res in fundo eius, et cessa tibi ex ea res quae suppuit: et utebitur de se ipso.
Then cauterize the wound after that.
Indeed, cautery is very valuable.
If however the bone is healthy and the nail also, but the nail-bed pushes down on the flesh towards the quick, and begins to pierce it and hurt it, then you must put a thin probe under the angle of the nail which is pushing into the flesh, and lift it up; and cut away that flesh easily, and put over what remains of the flesh some caustic medicine, corrosive sublimate, until all of it is removed.
Then dress it with ointments, until it heals.
If however the corruption has already affected the bone, then you must cut out that bone and remove it; for while this diseased bone remains it will never heal.Deinde uter oleribus medicatis, donec bene curentur.
If you see rust and decay approaching the finger, then cut it off at one of its joints, in accordance with what has been said earlier about this.
Then treat it until it is healed.
But if the nail is hurt by a bruise or blow and there is acute pain in it, then the weak one should be bled first.
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula with a transverse cut from above to below.
And beware lest the cut extend to the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause intense pain to come upon him and it will be a cause of additional growth of the flesh in that place.
Then treat the spot with something that soothes pains.
However, the added finger of some men's hands is all fleshy; and in some there are bones, and in others a nail; and some of them are born at the root of the joint or the growth is in some of its joints.
He therefore who is born in some of the joints of the finger does not move; but he who is born at the joint of the finger sometimes moves.
Therefore the section of that one which is fleshy is easy.
As it is, you cut it at its root with a wide spatula.Deinde facies, quod non crescit ad carnem et ossa digiti.
The treatment of that one whose growth is at the joint of the finger is difficult.
Therefore refrain from cutting it.Sed si per accidens contingat illi dolor vehemens super locum natiuitatis, tunc incide eum cum Spatumili acuto in sectionem transuersam donec facias sanguinem fluere.
But if intense pain happens to it at the site of growth, then cut the flesh with a sharp spatula with a circular cut until you make the blood flow.As for him who is born on the finger at its last joint, then you must cut the flesh first with a round cut up to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those fitting saws for it.Ita facies, quod ossa digiti et unguis sint in uno.
Then treat him until he is cured.
The consolidation which happens to the fingers adjacent to each other, occurs frequently either from birth, that is, one is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
One must then cut away at that consolidation, until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Then place between them linen or cloth infused with rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly; and separate them, or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the spot is consolidated as it should be.
And similarly if consolidation occurs on certain fingers with the palm, then cut that consolidation according to how it is prepared and how it suits the member's shape.Et si accidat consolidatio pedi aut mani, ut antea dictum est: quia pedis et mani sint in consimili situ, sic etiam debuet consolidatio pedis et mani esse in consimili situ:
Of incisions, defects.
Chapter 92.
Veins are envelopped, thick, full of black bile, which occurs in many parts of the body; and their outcome is most often in the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk and work and carry loads.
You should therefore give the body a strong shake to get rid of the black bile.
Then bleed the patient in those places.Quo facto utarunt alii.
The treatment with iron is according to two methods.
One of them is cauterization in order to draw out the black blood.
And the other mode is to open a vein and draw it all out.
And its incision is according to this method.
Moisten the leg first with much warm water, until the clotted blood dissolves.Postea fricta in loco ipso, si possit esse, vel in aliis locis, ubi potest bene circumduci.
Then rub the spot itself, if it can be, or in other spots where it can be bound well.Then tighten the leg of the sick person from above his hip to below his knee with a bandage.
Then open the vein in one spot, or two or three ample incisions.Postea infunde olerum cum vino in uenas, et postea extrahendo olerum sanguinem, et postea infundendo vinum, donec sanguis rursus inueat locum.
Then cut the nail to below: until blood flows out in an amount that you see sufficient, and which the strength of the sick person can tolerate.
Afterwards tie it and order him to abstain from foods that produce black bile and repeat the emptying and phlebotomy when the veins are full and it hurts the sick person.
However, its elevation is according to this method.
Shave the leg of the patient if there are many hairs on it.
Then put him into the bath or pour hot water over his leg until it turns red and the veins are dilated or he exercises vigorously if there is no bath available until the limb gets warm.
Then cut the skin along the vein directly or at its end near the knee or at its lower part near the heel.Secentur quoque crura inferius, et superius, ut sanguis ex utroque fluat: si non potest mori infimus.
The legs are also cut below and above so that blood flows from both, if the very sick person cannot die.Then open the skin with hooks and scrape away the vein from all sides until it appears to sight; there is a change in its appearance, which you see from red to dark declination.
When therefore blood flows out of the skin, you see it white like a string.
Then insert under it a needle until it is elevated and comes out of the skin; hang it with a blind hook, gently.Seces tibi cutem circum uenam cum lama scariolae, donec apparuat sensui: et facias eam latus versus medium.
You cut the skin around the vein with a scalpel until it appears to sight; and you make it towards the middle side.Then cut another section near that section by three fingers.
Then scrape away the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.Si non potest mori infimus: eleuatio et eversion prolixior est per omnes Venas.
If the very sick person cannot die: the elevation and eversion is longer through all the veins.Then elevate it with needles as you did before and hang it with another hook as you did at first.Seces iterum cutem circum uenam donec apparuat sensui, et facias eam latus versus medium, sicut fecisti in primis: et secet sub ea partem cum lama scariolae prope illam, quae apparuit sensui, et excoriat per omnes partes.
Then dry another section, or several sections if you need it.
Then lift and cut the last section by the heel.
Then draw it out to the section above it.
And do this until you have drawn it from all sections above it, until when it comes out entirely; then cut it.
But if it does not yield to being drawn out and lifted up, then insert a strong needle with a double thread and ligature it and draw it out; or else insert the blade under it, and roll your hand about to every side until it comes out.
And beware lest you cut it.
For if it is cut, then indeed it is very difficult to lift it up and there enters upon the sick person great harm from it.
When therefore you have drawn it out entirely, then place over the wound wool which has been dipped in wine and rose-oil, or oil; and tend it until it is healed.
If however the vein is contracted and bent and does not lie flat as we have said before, straight, then you must find above it on every side of its bend and place of bending.
Then lift it up with hooks until you have drawn it entirely out; and beware at the cut above it that you do not cut a vein or wound [it], for it will be difficult indeed for you to lift up or draw out [it].Et oportet ut incidas super eam per omnia loca, donec ueneris ad locum tortuositatis ipsius: et intromittas eam super loca tortuositatis: et reuolueris super omnia loca in quibus est tortuosa.
Therefore conserve your prudence.
The form of the incident by which the grape is cured.
The form of the blind fold.
There is no cure for it as there is for other folds, nor has it a sharp point so that it will not pierce the vein; and it is of great thickness, but pliable: for if it were thin, it would pierce the vein with its thinness; nay, it should have superfluous thickness, as we said.
On the extraction of the vein of the leg. CHAPTER NINETY-THREE.
This vein is generated in the legs in warm countries, as in Alizegi and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, warm lands, few in tenderness, that is, in which grass nor tree is born.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is indeed from putrefaction which occurs under the skin, just as occur within bodies serpents and worms ascaris, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.Et quare generatur in cruribus praeter alios locos corporis, propter quod est multum in illa parte humores calidi, et putrefacit sub cutem: nam ubi illuc uentur humores calidi, accidit putrefactio et generatio Vncinorum, sicut generantur serpentes intra corpora.
And a sign of the occurrence of this event in the vein is that there happens in the thigh an inflammation vehemens.
Then the place is cut open.
Then the vein begins to come out from the place of that opening as though it were a root or an animal.
So when its end comes out of it, you then have to wrap on top of it a remnant of lead, whose weight is from a keil drachma up to two drachmas and tie the knot: and leave the lead hanging from the thigh.
So often when something goes out of it to the outside, wrap that in lead, and tie it.Quod si quid in eo sit quod non possit egredi, erga locum uesicationis utramque parte: oportet ut tundeas locum illum, usquequaque ad mediam lunam intra crurem, et ad mediam lunam extra crurem, ita quod cum incipiunt vasa in ea uele citra crurem, tunc ad mediam lunam intra crurem et ad mediam lunam extra crurem.
If it is prolonged long, then cut the part of it, and wrap the remnant.Et tamen non oportet te ut fendas eam ad mediam lunam intra crurem: sed te ut tendas ad mediam lunam extra crurem.
And do not cut it at the root before it goes out altogether.Et quod si in ea, quae egreditur, fuerit aliquid quod non possit egredi, erga locum uesicationis utramque parte: oportet ut tundeas locum illum, usquequaque ad mediam lunam intra crurem, et ad mediam lunam extra crurem, ita quod cum incipiunt vasa in ea uele citra crurem, tunc ad mediam lunam intra crurem et ad mediam lunam extra crurem.
For if you cut it, it is drawn in and goes into the flesh, and makes an abscess, and rot in the place, and a bad ulcer.Quod si in ea fuerit aliquid quod non possit egredi, erga locum uesicationis utramque parte: oportet ut tundeas locum illum, usquequaque ad mediam lunam intra crurem et ad mediam lunam extra crurem ita quod cum incipiunt vasa in ea uele citra crurem tunc ad mediam lunam intra crurem et ad mediam lunam extra crurem.
Therefore it should be handled gently and extracted slowly until it emerges from its end, and nothing remains in the body; And indeed the Vein emerges in some men which is five palms long and ten wide.
And now it has come to me that it came out of a man 20 palms long.
If however you come across it in the course of your treatment, then insert a ray into its orifice and pierce it with a long hole, with the body, until everything that is in it is evacuated from matter; And administer putrefaction to the site with medicines for several days. Then heal the wound with an apposma treatment.
And this Vein indeed sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself; And accidents happen to it many openings, and a branch emerges from every opening.Quam ob rem oportet quando incidiuntur perierit, ut sint curati apposmatibus profunde et soluta Vena: nam si non erunt curati profunde, sed superficialiter, in diebus aliquot recidunt.
That is why it is necessary when they are cut to be cured with deep apposma and the vein is relieved; For if they are not cured deeply but superficially, they return within a few days.Therefore heal her as we have said in the division, and with that which has been said before.
§ On cutting for Worms generated under the skin, and it is called a Bouin disease.Hic oportet, ut incidiuntur loca vermium cum lance, et profunde eruantur, donec egrediatur totus vermis.
Chapter 94.Here it is necessary that the places of worms be cut with a lance and thoroughly excavated until the whole worm emerges.Et postea eruantur loca cum luis mel rosato, et aqua calida: si tamen non possit egredi totus vermis per unum locum, sed in aliquo parte corporis manet, et recidit quassatione pedum seu manum, ut antea diximus.
And afterward the places are excavated with rosewater and hot water; If, however, the whole worm cannot emerge through one place but remains in some part of the body and returns with the quaking of hands or feet as we said before.This disease is called in a certain land among us a Bouin disease: because it often happens to cattle, and it is a small single worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.Et si incidiuntur multum profunde, et non eruantur, sed soluta Vena recidunt in diebus aliquot.
And it goes all over the body, ascending and descending; and it is demonstrated to the senses during its walking from limb to limb until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin's surface and exits.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
As happen worms and snakes, that is, roundworms and threadworms in the belly.
And it is feared for its malignancy.
Because when it goes into the body and is lifted up to the head, and reaches its destination; then perhaps it opens in him, and exits, and destroys the eye: and that happens often.
When therefore you wish to cure him and extract it, then it is not done unless during its walking about, and the appearance of itself to the senses.Et quando uelletis extrahere eum cum illa manu qua extrahitur: neque per omnia loca extrahitur, sed solum per loca quae bene concinnata sunt:
It is necessary that what is above him and what is under him be bound with a strong tie.
Then cut over him, and pull him out.
If it is deeply embedded in the flesh and you cannot get to it, then put a cautery over the spot with fire until it dies.
And greater than that which is feared, is its corruption, by means of which it corrupts the eye, as we have said. But if you see that it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind below the eyebrow with a good ligature.
Then cut above it and pull it out.
And it is necessary that the weak person be treated with cleansing of his body by means of medicines which dissolve bad putrid humors.
And let him beware of foods that cause putrefaction.
§ On the incision for the disease called Nakir.
Chapter 95.
This disease is called Nakir in our country: it is a pain which occurs in certain limbs, and then shifts from limb to limb.
And indeed I have seen this myself, just as I am telling you now.Deinde si uult, faciat sectionem de parte capiti prope oculum cum securi utrique: et si non possit in uno oculi latere, sed debet mutare ad alterum.
I was called to a sick woman with some bumps.Deinde postea faciat sectionem super oculis utrique cum securi quoque: et si non possit, sed debet mutare ad alterum.
Then afterwards let him make an incision over both eyes with a blade, and if he cannot, then he must shift to the other eye. And he exposed his arm, and I saw a small inflammation in the vein of the arm's tendon.Et ego quidem facerem super eam sectionem cum securi utrique prope oculum: et si non posset mutare ad alterum oculus, sed debet mutare ad alium locum.
And after I had waited for an hour, I saw a swelling come forward with heat, like as a worm, going up to his shoulder faster than it can be; so that it was like living silver when it runs from one place to another.
And the pain went away from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Then I sat for an hour, and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached the other arm.Et post modum, uidi eam uenire ad mediam partem corporis, et ad caput et ad oculos: et ibi stetit.
And then he told me that it was revolving through his whole body, according as I saw.Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.
I was amazed at the speed of its passing from limb to limb.Et post modum, uidi eam uenire ad mediam partem corporis, et ad caput et ad oculos: et ibi stetit.
And indeed before that I had not seen this sickness with my eyes in this way.Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.
Nevertheless I have seen many who found the pain passing from limb to limb; and I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.Et post modum, uidi eam uenire ad mediam partem corporis, et ad caput et ad oculos: et ibi stetit.Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.
And I do not think it is anything but that the woman was of those whose bodies are dry from detected broken vessels; therefore it appears to me that that windiness was changing about.Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.
And it is necessary that they do not appear in this way in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with concealed vessels.Et post modum, uidi eam uenire ad mediam partem corporis, et ad caput et ad oculos: et ibi stetit.Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.
When you wish to heal it and the patient feels that pain, then if what we have said is visible to your eye, then quickly press above it and under it, and cut above it until that constricted windiness escapes, and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then heal it by shaking the body and with that which expels windinesses and carmines them with foul pills, and pills of serapin, and similar things.
Of the extraction of arrows.
Chapter 96.Cum ueniat sagitta in carnem: et non possit extrahenda: tunc si est extra corpore, tunc trahatur extra corpore cum omni sollicitudine: et si non possit extrahi: tunc incidebunt super eam, donec possit extrahi. When an arrow comes into the flesh, and cannot be extracted: then if it is outside the body, let it be drawn out of the body with all care; and if it cannot be pulled out, then they shall cut over it until it can be pulled out.Arrows are diverse according to their species, and according to the places in which they fall out of the body.
Their diversity however is that from some there are great points, and small; hollow and blunt.Et de his quoque est diuersitas: nam aliae in carnem intrant profundius: aliae autem superficialiter.
And of these there is also a difference, for some enter the flesh more deeply, others only superficially.And of these again, some have three angles.Et aliae quoque habent cuspidem in medio: et aliae habent duo: et aliae pauca.
And some also have a point in the middle; and some have two; and some few.And of those which are tongue-like.Ita ergo sagitta extrahitur cum omni sollicitudine: et si sanguis multum egredatur, et pateras facit, tunc debet medicus stancare manum suam, donec sanguis coagulari incipiat.
Therefore the arrow is extracted with all care; and if much blood flows out, and makes blisters, then the surgeon must tire his hand until the blood begins to coagulate.And of those which have stars.Cum ergo intruetur in carnem: et non possit extrahi: tunc incidebunt locum super eam, usquequaque ad radices: et traiant eam in contrarias partes.
When therefore it enters the flesh and cannot be extracted; then they shall cut over it in the place, always to the roots; and pull it in opposite directions.But those which are according to the limbs where they fall are according to two ways.Si enim cadunt ad extremitates: tunc extrahantur cum omni sollicitudine: sed si cadunt ad mediam partem, non debet trahi in contrarias partes: sed debet incidi super eam usquequaque ad radices.
Or are parts of the limbs principal and hollow in themselves like the brain, and heart, and liver, and lungs, and kidneys, and intestines, bladder, and their likes.
When therefore a wound is found in one of these parts and you see the signs of death which I shall narrate to you later, then you ought to proceed to extract that arrow from them, for death will follow him in whom it is located, in most instances.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of a limb, then extract it and treat the wound.
For when an arrow falls on the brain and penetrates bone and comes out of the membrane which is above the brain, there are: because violent vomiting and scotomia and vertigo and redness in the eyes and inflation and redness of the tongue and spasm and confusion of the intellect and vomiting of cholera occur from it.
And perhaps blood will flow out from the nose or ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off and voice is destroyed.
And a white moisture like pus flows out from the location of the wound.
And like meaty water it flows out from it.
If therefore you see these signs, then refrain from treatment and extract the arrow if it does not come out.Et si in corde cadit sagitta, et penetrat os corum, et egreditur per uiscerum eorum quod est ad uentrem, est mortis significatio.
And if an arrow falls on the heart and penetrates rib bone and comes out through their intestine which is towards the belly, it is a sign of death.The signs however of the arrow when it falls on the heart are: that it lies close to the left breast; and it feels with it as though it were fixed in a hard thing not in an empty thing.Et sentit uertiginosum et uerebrovem, et rubedinem faciei, et spasmum membrorum, et permixtionem sensum, et uomitum cholerae, et mortificationem carnis in loco uulneris.
And perhaps an arrow is a movement similar to that of the pulse: and black blood runs from the wound.
And then follows chilliness in the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope.
Know therefore, beyond doubt, that death is at hand.
And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the escape of frothy blood from the wound; and swelling sets in where the neck joins the shoulder, and the patient's colour changes.
And he gasps for breath, and seeks cold air.
If an arrow falls into the breast-plate, then it is near the ribs; and a great sigh comes with much pain, with panting, and all the limbs shake.Et si pulsus fit in plica inter costales, est motus uertiginoso: et stat ille periculoso, pedibusque uenit apoplexia.
And if an arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested will exit through the wound from food.
And if an arrow falls into the belly and is stuck there: some feces will exit through the wound, or a hernia, or disrupted intestine.
There is therefore no hope for a cure of him, nor in removing the arrow.
If an arrow falls into the bladder and urine exits, and something passes to the exterior, and the pain is stronger in the invalid, then you shall know that it is deadly.
The rest of the members, as face, neck, throat, shoulder blade, helper, vertebrae of the back, breastbone, hip, thigh, and those similar from the members are healed according to many dispositions when an arrow does not find an artery or nerve, and it is not a poisonous arrow.
And I tell you that I have seen the existence of these arrows so that you can recognize them in relation to your cure.
This is because a man fell an arrow into the tear gland of his eye, at the root of his nose.Et non poterat egredi flectere, neque ad latera, nec ad aliam partem; sed erat uertice capiti in medio.
And he could not exit by bending, neither to the sides nor to another part; but it was on the top of his head in the middle.So I extracted it for him from under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no damage occurred to him in his eye.Et cecidit sagitta ad aliam uiraginem in lachrymali oculi eius, quod est contra eam partem, ubi prior erat.
And an arrow fell to another woman in the tear gland of her eye, which is opposite that part where the first was.And I extracted another arrow for a Jew, who had fallen to him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not get from it except its small end, with which it adhered to his wood; and it was a great arrow from the arrows of the bows of the Turks, with a blunt iron, in which there are no ears.Et erat lachrymalis oculi eius conuersa in locum quod non debet.
A Jew was cured, and no accident happened to his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and that is the one with ears.
So I cut above it between two veins: and now it was submerged in his throat.
I was careful with it until I extracted it, and the Christian was cured.
And I extracted another arrow from a man who had fallen into his belly; and we thought that he would die of it.
After he had been thirty days, and no change occurred in him from the scheme, I cut above the arrow; and I probed on it, and extracted it, and he was cured, and no accident happened to him.
And I saw a man to whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound was closed over it.
After he had been for seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen on her belly; and the wound was closed over it, and the arrow remained inside her; and no change occurred from its state, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man to whom an arrow had fallen on his face; and the wound was closed, and remained, not finding much pain for him; and many similar to these.Et si quaeritis de uulnus, quomodo fit, ut uelociter sanentur in homine multum vulnera, et multas pestes: et si quaeritis pro quo, quomodo uelociter fiunt mortui, et quomodo fiunt mortui in vita, audietis de eo.
And if you ask about the wound, how it is that wounds are quickly healed in a man, and many plagues; and if you ask for what, how quickly death is done, and how death is done in life, you will hear about it.And I extracted an arrow from one of the king's officials, which had fallen on his nose, and now it was declining a little to the right side; and the whole arrow was hidden.
I was called to his cure after the arrow fell until three days.Et intraveram in domum eius, et uidi eum in somno suo dormientem: et super caput eius posui sagittam meam, et remisi eum ad somnum meum, et dormi.
I found therefore the wound of the arrow very tight.
I examined it therefore with a fine probe, and I found no sensation; but he himself did feel the pricking and pain under his right ear.
I suspected then that this was the point of the arrow.
I plastered the place therefore with a plaster having an attractive and digestive virtue, confiding that the aposteme would come to a head, and that I should see the sign of the arrow, in order to cut over it; but it happened not as I expected, for no mark appeared showing that the arrow had been there.
I persevered therefore with the plaster over him for many days; and there happened no accident, but in the meantime the wound got well: and he remained feeble from the extraction of it for a space of some days, until one day he felt the arrow in his nostril.
And he narrated to me that.
I put therefore over that wound a sharp and corrosive medicine for many days, until it was open; and with a probe I examined it, and felt the tip of the arrow which adhered to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound by means of that sharp medicine, until the tip of the arrow appeared visibly to us; and it was about four months before I got over this.Quod autem est mirabile, quod in illo tempo non apparuit nisi una solum sagitta inter nasum et maxillam suam: sed sensit multas sagittas intra lumen corporis sui.
Now what is wonderful is that in all that time not more than one arrow appeared between his nose and his cheek; but he felt many arrows within the cavity of his body.Thereupon, when the wound got larger, and I could conveniently put forceps into it, and move it, and it did not yield to exit; then I did not cease probing it and devising means for it with various tools, until one day I began on it with properly made forceps, according as their form would permit at the end of the handle, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
The physicians indeed judge that cartilage of the nose does not get well again.Sed per gratiam Dei et medicamentorum nostrorum restaurata est.
I restored it therefore and made the wound sound and healed its disease with a full cure; and indeed nothing at all harmed him.
And I tell you the quality of the extraction of some arrows, so that you may put that rule and meaning over that which I have not said.
Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with narration, neither does that book, and a wise craftsman compares little with much, and with what is present over that which is absent, and finds new operation and new instrument at the descent of foreign things of this art when they happen.
I say therefore that arrows do not go out of the members to which they are fixed unless according to two ways.Est autem prima via ut per feriam sagitta extrahatur cum capite suo et cum omni parte sua. The first way then is that by an incision the arrow is extracted with its head and with all its parts.Or by attraction from the place from which it entered.Et ista via est optima, nisi quando sagitta intrauit in os, vel in oculum, vel in aliam partem corporis, quae non patitur incisionem: et quia illuc sagitta per traiectum sanguinem intrauit, faciunt per traiectum sanguinis extractio.
And this way is best, unless when the arrow entered into a tooth or an eye or another part of the body that does not permit incision, and because the arrow entered there by passing blood, they make extraction by passing blood there again in the opposite part.Or vice versa from the other part.Et hac via extrahitur sagitta cum capite suo et cum omni parte sua et cum omni parte sui calcis.
And by this way the arrow is extracted with its head and with all its parts and with all the part of its tip.And that which exits where it entered, either is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place; and it is drawn and exits.Et hac via extrahitur sagitta cum capite suo et cum omni parte sua et cum omni parte sui calcis.
If it does not yield to exit from the hour in which it fell, then one must leave it for some days until the flesh that is around it putrefies and its attraction and exit are alleviated.Et si non obedit ad extrahendum per attractionem, sed est in loco carnoso: et cadit intra os: et non potest exire: aut cadit intra palpebras oculi: tunc oportet illam omnino dimittere donec discescat caries in carnibus quae circumdant sagitta.
And if it does not yield to extraction by attraction but is in a fleshy place and falls within the jaw and cannot exit or falls within the eyelids, then one must leave it altogether until the rot descends into the flesh that surrounds the arrow.And likewise if it becomes fixed in bone and does not yield to exit, then one must leave it for several days as well and repeat its attraction and movement every day until it exits.Et quod si in os cadit: et intrauit carnem valde: sed non est in loco osseo: sed per atractionem oportet extrahendes eam: tunc dimitte eam aliquot diebus, donec omnino discescat caries carnis quae circumdant sagitta.
If it does not yield to you after several days, then one must bore into the bone all around with a small auger until the holes are enlarged.
Then draw it out and extract it.
But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the skull and has already pierced one of the ventricles of the brain, and certain symptoms of those I have mentioned are apparent from it: then abstain from drawing out the arrow, and leave it until after several days.
For if the arrow has pierced to the brain, death will not be prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of the bone only and has not penetrated to the brain, and he remains sick for several days, and none of those accidents happen to him: then act on your own initiative regarding drawing out the arrow and extracting it.Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.
If it does not yield to you after several days, then one must bore into the bone all around with a small auger until the holes are enlarged.But if it is stuck fast and does not yield to you on being drawn out: then apply trepanning around the arrow as I have described above: then care for the wound until he recovers.
But if the arrow is already hidden in a part of the body and concealed and hidden from the senses: then seek it with touch.Et si non obegit tibi ad exitum per dies: tunc oportet ut perfores sagittae in omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificantur sagittae.
If you feel it, then pull it with some instruments appropriate for pulling it.
If you cannot get above it, because of the tightness of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow that is deep inside, and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein: then search above it, until the wound widens, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
If there are ears by which it is held, then free the flesh attached to them on every part, with every means you can, and force it, if the flesh cannot get above the wound because of the break and twisting of the ears, until it is released.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps on all parts, until you make it come out; and with utmost subtlety, so that the arrow does not break and it becomes difficult for you to pull it out and extract it.
If you cannot get above it after one hour, then leave it for several days until what is around it decays.Et post aliquanto tempus facies iterum, et extrahes illam: et quod diximus, si non possit eadem via per qua intravit extrahi: quia illa uariabit iter suum, et per aliam via est intrat, et iterum extrahenda est per eandem, et ita facies.
Then repeat this: the wound must be cauterized if it causes a flow of blood against you. If however it causes no bleeding, then apply what we said about healing in its own chapter, and guard your strength from cutting an artery or nerve or tendon.
And use ingenuity in every way possible to avoid the arrow's strike. And let that be with ease and tranquility or slowness and strength as I have told you.
And it is necessary to do with the arrow as you draw it that it be feeble according to its shape, according to how it was at the time of the arrow's impact upon it.
Because it is more effective for the arrow to be drawn in this way.
But if that is not possible for you then do what is possible according to the figures.
The arrow however which emerges from the opposite side of the other or has already exited it to go outside, causes a swelling at its tip by pressure through the upper layer of the skin nearby, and you see it protruding: cut over it then, and the incision should be according to how much is held in it by the forceps.
Then draw it out: for it makes itself easy to come out.And if the arrow is stuck at the shoulder joint so that you cannot move it around the joint, then do not cut the skin over it, but take a needle and pierce through from one side to the other where the arrow is stuck and tie a ligature around the tip of the arrow.
But if it is stuck in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow presses into the bone and widens itself: then pull on it. If however it does not come out but remains as before, then cut off its tip with a pair of forceps and remove the end from the bone.
And if not, leave it for several days: then repeat this until it emerges.Now concerning the arrow that is lodged in the throat, draw it out, for its removal is easier than its entry.
If indeed a splinter from the arrow is still in it, then push it with that. If however it does not emerge, then cut into the throat until you find a vein or artery: tie off that vein or artery and pull out the arrow.And if something has entered the eye along with the arrow, do not draw it out by force, but treat the wound first and on another day draw out the thing which is in it.
But if indeed the splinter has fallen out, and you wish to apply force, then insert into it a hollow tool so that its hollow enters the tail of the arrow: then push on it with this. If however it will not come out by such means, then cut away all of the flesh and skin around it, and take the arrow out by its tail, and if any splinter remains, pluck it out with a pair of forceps or cut it out with a scalpel, and draw out the arrow's head.
If the arrow is concave, then push it with a tool that goes into it.
Indeed, the arrow is extracted through it.
If the arrow is venomous, then you ought to draw out all the concave flesh in which the venom is, if it's possible for you to do that.
Then care for it with what's appropriate for that.
If the arrow is falling into the breast, or belly, or throat, or side; and it's near to what you're touching with your probe, and it' possible for you to cut over it, then cut, and beware of cutting a vein, or nerve, and extract it.
Then heal the wound, if you see that, and care for it until it's well.
And this is the shape of forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let their ends be like a bird's beak, which is made of iron: when they seize upon the arrow, they do not let it go.
And there are many shapes of them, great, small, and medium, according to the quantity of the magnitude of the arrow, and smallness of it, and width of the wound, and its constriction.
Shape of the concave-pusher.
And shape of the deaf-pusher.
This is the deaf end as a ray, so that its entrance into the concave arrow may be opened, and it's pushed with it.
This end of the concave-pusher is concave like a bird' feather, so that the entrance into the arrow is opened and it's pushed with it.
Of bleeding of veins.
Chapter 97. Veins to be bled from, of which there are thirty whose custom runs through the body.
Of these, there are sixteen in the head: two pulse veins, which are behind the ears, called two herbs; and two arteries, which are on either side of the temples and apparent; and two veins which are on both tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called gaze-ers; and a vein which is prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is in the end of the nose.
And two Girdle-guides, which are on the neck.
And two Veins, that are upon the upper lip of the mouth.
And two Veins which are on the lower lip. Et duae uenae quae tendunt a vasis oculorum ad nasum.
And two Veins that go from the Eye-veins to the nose. And these are they which are called Algecirich. Et una vena quae est in medio oculi et facit angulum cum palpebra.
And one Vein that is in the middle of the eye, and makes an angle with the eyelid. And two Veins which are under the tongue.
But the Veins which are bled in the arms, there are five Veins in every arm.Et duodecim venae quae phlebotomantur a corpore, sunt cum singulis pedibus.Quod si ad illas uenas qui sciunt anatomiam pertinerit, omnia haec faciunt ad eorum curam, ut libet;
And twelve Veins are bled from the body in the feet. Now if one who knows anatomy will attend to these things as he pleases; One of them is the Cephalick, and it is upon the silister side; and the people call it the Vein of the head.
And the Dusc. Et Vena Torantica et est media inter uenas quae phlebotomantur in manibus.
And the Thoracick is between the Veins that are bled in the hands. And it is the middle Vein, and made up of a branch from the Basilick, and a branch from the Cephalick; and this the people call the Vein of the body. Et Vena Basilica, et est sub uena media, uti dixi: et est cum pariete brachii.
And it is in the groin, and is placed on the side of the body; and it is also called the Girdle Artery.
And the people call it the Womb Vein.
And the Artery of the Arm, and it is placed above the elbow; and it is that in which blood-letting is performed, and it is that which appears clearly above the wrist by a manifest swelling.
And the Little Finger Vein; and it is that between the ring finger and the little finger; and it has two branches.Et Dominus, nomine, in quo posita est uena super focile: et est illa quae apparit supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.
And there are three Veins in the thigh and leg; the first is that which appears above the wrist, by a manifest swelling.The second is between the bones of the leg: and it is called the Great Vein of the Leg, because it receives all the veins from the foot, as you will presently see; and it is placed behind the bone of the leg.The third is the Small Vein of the Leg, which receives the blood from the toes, as you will learn hereafter.
One of them is that which is below the bend of the little finger on the ulnar side; it is called the Vein of the Little Finger, and receives no veins but from the little finger only: it opens into the back of the hand, opposite to the ball of the thumb.The other is that which is under the bend of the index finger on the side of the palm; and this they call the Vein of the Index Finger: it receives two veins from the index finger, and one from the ball of the thumb.
The second is that which they call the Small Vein of the Leg, because its size is smaller than the other; it begins at the back part of the heel, and runs up along the side of the leg to the groin, in front of the bone of the leg, as you will presently see.And there are two Arteries in the leg: one runs upon the top of the foot, and is called the Dorsal Artery; and it receives many small branches from the knee, which supply the skin of the leg with blood, and ends at the great toe.The other is placed behind the bone of the leg, and is called the Calf Artery; and it also sends branches to the leg.And it has two parts: one begins at the groin, and runs along the back part of the leg; the other rises out of this, and runs down the back part of the foot towards the heel.
And there is another vein, which they call the Vein of the Heel; its place is at the back part of the heel, and it receives two veins from the back part of the foot; one from the outside of the leg, the other from the inside: and it opens into that large vein which is behind the bone of the leg.And there are also two Veins in the Leg, which they call the Perforating Veins; because they pierce through the bones of the leg, and end in the Great Vein of the Leg.There is one on each side of the leg: that on the outer side begins at the outside of the foot, and runs up along the outside of the leg to the groin; that on the inner side begins also at the inside of the foot, but runs up along the inside of the leg to the groin.And these perforating veins receive many other little branches from the bones of the leg, which supply them with blood: they are small and flat, and lie very near to one another in a line through the bone, and end both in the Great Vein of the Leg.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
¶ Of the bleeding of two veins after the ears.
But as to the bleeding of two veins which are behind the ears, it is a remedy for long-standing catarrh, and for migraine, and for sahafat, and for old ulcers of the head.
And as to the quality of bleeding them I will relate what is proper.
And it is done by causing the head of the patient to be bled, and then rubbing his nape, where the two veins are, with a rough cloth with good rubbing.Et postea ut lavetur caput infirmus cum aqua calida, et ungatur cum oleum nicomediae, vel cum suco de rubeis, vel cum oleo quodam bonum ad ulcera capitis:
Then let the patient's head be washed with warm water and anointed with nicomedia oil or with rubia juice, or with some other good ointment for ulcers of the head;
And their places are behind the ears at two depressed spots of the head.Et si uenae non apparierunt ad primam phlebotomiam, iterum stringatur collum, et iterum fricetur in locis earum:
And if the veins do not appear after the first bleeding let the neck be again pressed and the places again rubbed; seek therefore for them with your finger, and when you feel their pulsation under your finger mark the place with cautery.Et postea frictio fit in locis uenarum cum suco de rubeis et cum oleum nicomediae:
And afterwards rubbing is done on the vein places with rubia juice and with nicomedia oil; then take the blade for bleeding which is called the Incident.Et faciatur cum eo phlebotomia in locis eorum ubi sunt signata, donec apparant uenae, et apparant sanguis:Et postea ut fit ligation cum ligatura, et ut ponitur super uenas.
Then introduce it under the skin until the bleeding reaches the mouth.
Then lift your hand with the thread and skin up to the top, and cut the thread with an incision in the skin.
Let the length of the incision be about two inches or so; and let as much blood come out as you see fit.
Then tie it with threads, and leave it until it heals.Et sic fac de cunctis uenis quae in corpore sunt.
And thus has been said at the beginning of this book about the cutting and cauterization of these veins.
¶ Of bleeding from two arteries in the temples.De phlebotomia venarum in cutibus pedum et manuum.
The bleeding of the two arteries which are in the two temples is appropriate for old migraine and constant nausea, and for the flowing out of acute excesses to the eyes.Et si in his uenatis non ueniat ad os phlebotomia sed perueniat in cutem, disciendae sunt. And if from these veins bleeding does not reach the mouth but is absorbed into the skin, they must be pricked.And the quality of bleeding them is according to what I now tell you.In his uenatis ergo incide ut supra diximus.
Therefore in these veins cut as we said above.Let the sick person tightly tighten his neck a great deal, until two veins become clearly apparent to sight, and their pulse be felt under your finger.Et uenationem fac illorum secundum qualitatem morbi, et secundum sensum tuum.
And let the bleeding of them be according to the quality of the disease, and according to your sense.Then after that cauterize with encaustic.Et postea eleuat collum multum et stringat, donec uenae apparant sensui.
Then lift the skin above the vein with your index finger, and insert the venesection instrument underneath, and lift the vein to the surface.
And cut it as you did with the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to your needs. Then release the patient's compression, and place your finger over the vein for one hour.
Then put a bandage and a poultice on it, and compress it firmly from above: and leave it until the patient recovers.
And now there follows a reminder of these, and their cutting and extraction at the beginning of the book.Et postea de ambitu et de pulvere medicato loquemus.
¶ Of venesection of the forehead vein after venesection of the head vein.Et si facias incisionem uenae frontis, quia non potest habere praesumptum de pulvere medicato: et tamen debet fieri, si necesse fuerit:
Indeed the indication for venesection of the forehead vein is after venesection of the head vein, for old diseases of the face; and for migraine, and redness; and foul ulcers.Et si facias phlebotomiam uenae frontis, in quolibet de his morbis praesumens, et postea incidas: et sic rememoratur infirma:
And the quality of its venesection is, according to what I tell you.Nam de ambitu loquemus.
Indeed let the patient compress his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.Et si non posset apparere uena: postea fac ut coarteret latera collum, et faciat ut trahat ad se capitis partes, donec apparere uenam:Et si non possit apparere uena, solua sit infirma constrictione collum: et postea fac incisionem super cotum.
Then take the instrument which is called the Forceps.Et intromitte eum ad uenem, usque qua posset pertingere.
Whose form is this.
Place the prominent sharp instrument that is in the head of the fossorial tool above the vein itself and strike it with a comb or with something else in its way; and let the blood flow according to the amount you see fit.
Then open up the piercing of the patient, and tie it up until it heals.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide bloodletting instrument.
However, it should not be that the bloodletting instrument has an acute end as the other bloodletting instruments do, but rather a wide end.Nam et aliter non potest percipi venam cum phlebotomo acuto nec cum fossorio.
And she is bled according to her pulse: because the mouth is near; and perhaps the bleeding instrument will be broken when it is thin.
Of phlebotomy of the veins in the two tear ducts.
The cause of phlebotomy of the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes is because of a skin disease and redness; and because of pain in the eye and facial diseases.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that it tightens the weak neck with life.
Then you bleed them; and stand above his head.Et si in eo frangeris, et non possis facere ut sanguis eorum non cadat in oculum eius, perstringe eum cum uita et fac illum stetere: et postea fac phlebotomiam.
And it will happen that you break in it, and cannot do so that their blood does not fall into his eye, tighten him with life and make him stand: and then do the phlebotomy. And the phlebotomy is done according to the transversion a little in length, with a small phlebotomist, a little wide, for there is no flesh in the place.Et postea perstringe eum cum uita, et fac illum stetere, et fac sanguinem eorum cadere: et postea fac phlebotomiam super oculum.
If indeed the phlebotomy is subtle at its extremity, perhaps it will be broken.
Then have blood run out as much as you need.
And put on them a bandage, and tighten them for one night, and loosen them.
Of bloodletting of the veins of the nose:
But the bloodletting of the nose veins is appropriate for acute fever, and violent headache, and facial illness, as with a half-stroke, and redness which happens on the face, especially when it is chronic.
And its quality is that he tightens his feeble neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand and take a subtle, long bloodletting tool, and fix it in the middle of his nostril between that which separates the nose according to its straightness.
Because the vein does not appear there by sight and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is fitting that you go a little with the hand holding the bloodletting tool and have blood flow according to your need.
Then tie it for one night.
For indeed it is quickly restored.De phlebotomia oculorum Nasi et aurium:
Of bloodletting of the eye veins and ear:
But for two bloodletting tools of the Gui-dji there is remedy for constriction of breath and outbreak of leprosy and melancholy illnesses, and impetigo and bad sores and corroding ulcers that are called herpes estiomenes:
And the quality of their bloodletting is to tighten the feeble beneath his neck with a bandage and let the operator stand over the head of the sick person while the sick person sits on a seat.Et trahat artifex phlebotomiam una manu sua, et flectat eam ad modum crucis in medio nari, ubi uena apparet sensui: et tene eam, donec sanguis confringatur.
And let the operator draw the bloodletting tool with one hand of his and bend it in the shape of a cross in the middle of the nostril where the vein appears by sight: and hold it, until the blood is stopped.Then let him briefly bloodlet the vein with an ample bloodletting tool.
Then extract a moderate quantity of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for that purpose.
Then do the same with another vein.
Afterwards loosen the ligature and tighten the two veins with a medium tight bandage so that the patient is not overheated.
And leave it until the morning.Et si mox moriturus uiderit, et non possit durare donec matutina hora ueniat, tunc fac de hac modo:
And if he is about to die soon and cannot last until the morning hour comes, then do this:For a wound is healed.Purges enim et potus fuit: id est lympha.
A purging of blood vessels is what it is.
However, Algeberich's phlebotomy is a medicine for blood vessels because it brings relief to the mouth, and the corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, and also fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, as well as those which are in the nose, and around its surroundings.Et si non possit durare usque matutinae horae, cum sanguine temperato: uti debet et tunc dimittere eum in quiete donec mane ueniat.
And if he cannot last until the morning hour, with tempered blood, you should use it then and let him go in quietness until the morning comes.The quality of their phlebotomy is that you should make the patient sit before you, and tighten his neck with a bandage.Et facis uti de uenarum sanguine temperato cum aqua: et facis bibi eum post fastium, et post mictionem, et post vomitionem.
Then you use tempered blood with water, and make the patient drink it after fasting, and after urination, and after vomiting.Then loosen his lip, and look at the two veins, one of which is on the right side of the lip, and the second on its left: and their demonstration is through the darkness of amber.Et si non uiderint per nigredinem ambarum, sed per albedinem eorum: tunc facis uti de sanguine temperato cum aqua et vino, et facis bibere infirmo post fastium, et mictionem, et vomitionem.
And that is true: because around their edge are tiny black veins.
Therefore cut both with an oblique incision. If you are in doubt about which of them is the greater then go by the larger one and cut it.
And similarly do with the two veins in the upper lip, and usually the custom is to cut along with it, and likewise cut the two veins that are in the lower lip.Et si non faceres, ergo sanguis currit per eam: et non debes loqui de hac uena cum quolibet homine.
And if you did not, then the blood will run through it and you should not speak of this vein to anyone.
Indeed, the two veins that are under the tongue are phlebotomized for the sake of fainting spells which are in the throat and for ailments of the uvula and ailments of the mouth.Et sic facis ut in uenisonem post Cephalicae: et incide eam usque ad profundum, donec sanguis erumpat, et uenisonem currit consuetudo cum eo per labia.
And you do it just as in the vein after the Cephalicus: and cut it deeply until blood comes out, and usually the vein is cut along with the lip.And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person sits between your hands facing the sun: and lift up his tongue, and look under his tongue at one side to see one vein, and on the other side to see another vein, and the color of both inclines towards blackness.Et si non uides uenas quae sunt sub lingua: sed uides carnem albulam et nigram: incide carnem albam donec sanguis erumpat: et postea carnem nigram, et illuc incide, ubi te inuit.
Phlebotomy then both of them; and beware that you not cut your hand in phlebotomizing them.
For under the nail are arteries, and perhaps it will happen that there will be a flow of blood from those arteries.
Of the three veins in the elbow.
Now there are three veins which are bled at the elbow; and to these the custom of phlebotomy has run in all men.Quaruntur utrimque, et prima sub capite cubiti interior et externus lateris, quae vocatur antecubitalis vena.
And they are on either side; the first is under the head of the inner and outer elbow, which is called the anterior cubital vein. And phlebotomy of these is performed in two ways.Secunda autem vena sub capite externi cubiti juxta radicem braciae, quae vocatur ceu radialis, et hic ad modum fit phlebotomia.
But the second vein is under the head of the outer elbow near the root of the arm, which is called radial, and here phlebotomy is performed in this way. Either with a wide myrtle-wood phlebotomy or an olive-wood phlebotomy for subtlety, or by cutting with a knife, and it is Alnesil.Et prima ad modum cum Phlebotomo, et secando; nam qui percutient percutit utrinque in extremitatibus: sed qui inciden in medio, saepe faciunt haematem.
And the first is done with a phlebotomy and cutting; for he who pricks pricks on both sides at the ends: but those who meet in the middle often make blood. And this is its form.Pungatur ergo cum Phlebotomo in extrema, et saepe percutiant utrinque.
Therefore it is pricked with a phlebotomy at the end, and often pricks on both sides. Thus Alnesil is what it suits to section.Et illi qui saepe phlebotomantur in cubito, faciant haematem, quod percutient utrinque in extremitatibus: nam ad mediam partem non perveniunt.
And those who are often bled in the elbow make blood, because they pricks on both sides at the ends: for they do not reach the middle part. And from these there are wide species and subtle according to the breadth of the veins and their tightness. The form of the myrtle-wood phlebotomy is wide, as you see it.
And it suits to open hollow veins, full, proceeding, apparent, thick, and those which contain thick blood, turbid.Et uenarum concauitas faciunt in ea parte ubi conueniunt percutiant: nam ad mediam partem non perveniunt nec ad extremitatem.
And the concavity of the veins is made in that part where they meet: for they do not reach the middle part nor to the end. And this phlebotomy is less breadth, and more subtle at the ends.Et ille qui uoluit percutere ad mediam uenam, faciat haematem: nam non pervenit ad extremitatem.
And it is convenient for bloodletting of the fine veins that contain thin yellow blood.
¶ Of the bloodletting of the basilic vein.
The basilic vein, however, which is one of these three veins, has a phlebotomy instrument inserted into it. Because it draws blood from diseases under the throat and neck, from that which follows the breast, and the abdomen: and it is convenient for the bloodletting man to bloodlet her with a bloodletting instrument, so that he may take care and be above fear because there is an artery under it.
If therefore he makes a mistake and adds to the puncture of the bloodletting, he will hit that artery and there will be an outflow of blood.Et si non fuit expertus huius uenarum phlebotomia, uenam basiliki et arteriam inter se confundit, cum sanguine uenoso: et illa quae est contra laterem, quae dicitur uena portarum.
And if he is not experienced in the bloodletting of these veins, he will confuse the basilic vein and artery with pulsating blood; and that which is on the side, which is called the vein of the gates. Therefore it is necessary that he does not bloodlet her with a piercing bloodletting instrument; rather let him be cutting with Alnesil.
If however it does not appear by manifest appearance, then it is necessary that you move away from her and switch to another one, or seek some branch of it; or bloodlet in the place of it the arm vein.Quam ob causam phlebotomiam illius non fieri debet cum sanguine uenoso: sed cum phlebotomo secante.
This is the reason why its bloodletting should not be done with pulsating blood; but with a cutting bloodletting instrument. For it is manifest, and cut it with the Anesil bloodletting instrument, as we said.Et si quaeratur ramum eius, quia non potest secare illam: et in illa sanguis uenosus est, sicut diximus, ergo phlebotomes cum funere brachii ad ea uel ad aliam uenam per se.
If however you wish to bleed from that vein, then you must touch with your fingers in front of the bend of the arm until you can feel the pulse.
Then mark with a cautery over the spot, then the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using an Albucasis phlebotomy needle as we said above.
And be careful not to let the blow fall through the space from the site of the artery.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, that there is a pulsation at the spot which you marked with the cautery, then it is an arterial pulsation; therefore avoid it.
If however you see the blood rise in the bleeding as a boy's urine does, and the blood is bright red, then know that this is arterial blood.
Then therefore quickly put your finger over that spot for a long time, then take away your finger.Deinde secanda est uenula cum phlebotomo Alnesil sicut diximus: sic facito.
Then the vein should be cut with an Albucasis phlebotomy needle as we said above; so do this.If blood is drawn (and often it is), then tighten the arm and let it go, and the invalid must take care not to move at all, and he must remain above fear.
And he must not move it for several days until he recovers.Si autem non uellet sanguis, sed pulsat, et est pulsus arteriae: tene eam ut suprascribimus, sicut diximus.
If however the blood will not flow but pulses and it is an arterial pulsation as described above, then hold it as we have written.But if no blood is drawn and it resists you: and you do not have medicine at hand in that moment, then cut the artery, if it is clear to you.
For its ends are constricted and the blood is cut off.Et caue non incidas arteriam, donec facias experimentum per spatium alium de pulsu: neque debes inciere arteriam, donec cognoscas eam certe sicut diximus.
Or take the bark of the pistachio tree and find it; take one-half of it and press it over the spot with a suitable bandage and poultices until the next day.
Then if blood is drawn off, it is good.
And if not, then the treatment is the same as that which precedes it in the recall of the spot of the poultices from which blood flows; and stopping the flow of blood is not difficult in several dispositions because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of a ligature from the arm.
¶ Of bleeding the Dark Vein.
The dark vein is a suitable subject for bleeding, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower part of the body; because it is composed of the basilar vein and the cephalic vein, as we have said.Quam ob causam cum trahit sanguinem ex parte capitis superius, et non possit uenire ad eam per ramum Basilicam ut praecedat:
And it behoves the phlebotomist that he should be above fear from his phlebotomy; for beneath it is a nerve.
If therefore he adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, it comes to pass that there ensues upon it stupor, and the cure of it is difficult, and perhaps it is not completely cured.
And this nerve very often appears to sense.
But if it is hidden in some men, and is subtle, and does not appear: then you ought to place your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize, the incision with Alnesil, and the division of the nerves with your strength.
If it is a vein between two nerves, then find the vein in length.Et si neruus est intra utramque uenam, non debes intrare intra neruos, sed intra utramque uenam.
Of the Good Head-Vein.
The phlebotomy of the head vein is however a remedy, because it draws blood from the head and brings relief to eye diseases.
And it is proper in this vein alone, if you wish, to let the blood by pricking with a phlebotomy needle made of olive or myrtle wood; for it is safer than any other vein because it does not have beneath it an artery or nerve. However, it is appropriate for you when using the phlebotomy needle to pierce only the head of the lizard and look for a soft place; and it does not hurt if it is not found with a first blow so that one can go over it several times with the phlebotomy needle. However, perhaps an abscess forms in some men when it is not drained on the first blow, but that abscess does no harm to anyone.
Of the usefulness of phlebotomy and the precautions to be observed in using it.Haec uenarum sectio omnium est utilissima: et per eam multae aegritudes curantur, vel auerunt, vel lenientur.
The quality of phlebotomy and its incidents from it, for which you need to think about its correction.
First of all, you need to know that phlebotomy is not administered unless it is for the preservation of health and its constancy, and caution from the advent of diseases.
And for phlebotomy to be performed on one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the cephalic, the dark, and the basilic.
And for phlebotomy to be performed in the spring after fasting, in the truth, and in summer: and autumn, and winter after fullness appears.
And let phlebotomy be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed from the day.Et fiat phlebotomia in capite non pluris semel, ne obruiatur sanguis: et in brachiis bis: et in pedibus semel.
Phlebotomy which is administered to the sick does not have a set time; but when it is convenient and necessary, during the night or day, at any hour, and at all times.
Children should not be bled until they are fourteen years old.
Nor should a pregnant woman be bled from the fourth month until the seventh. Neque uero post partum, donec perfugiat mensem tertium.
Nor should the elderly, who have already surpassed sixty years, be bled.
When anyone is to be bled for whatever reason, he must cleanse his bowels beforehand with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained excrement in them; so that the veins may not be drawn upon by putrid and harmful superfluities from the intestines during phlebotomy, which injures the principal members.
Nor should a patient be bled when suffering from dysentery, that is, from nausea and vomiting; nor while vomiting as a result of drunkenness, until these conditions have passed.
Nor with an invalid who has dropsy. Neque qui habet primam hoream, nisi postea quaedam horeas remisse uiderit: neque qui habet tertiam et quartam hoream, nisi per pauca dies remittantur.
And bloodletting is to be repeated after colic pain, and vomiting, and abdominal discharge, and excessive sexual intercourse, and exertion, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and everything that dissipates strength from a bodily thing or an animal.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines; if it is possible for him to do that.
Then he should enter a bath, if something doesn't prohibit him; or he should engage in some exercise, so that the blood is subtilized.
And place his bloodletting in the chest, around the third day, as we have said; and try to evacuate his chest on that day of all bad animal accidents: such as oppression, and anger, and fear; and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excessive sexual intercourse, and things like them.
And let him have present the things whose use custom has approved from among aromatic, and fragrant, and stimulant, and similar things to the extent of possibility.
Then the bloodletter should sit above the bed in which the person being bled is lying; afterwards he should extend his arm and rub it with his hand twice or three times.Et deinde faciat periculum super brachio suo ut sanguis currit: et sic incipiat, et non ducat manu sua phlebotomam, sed sanguis perculat eum per tubam in vasa quae posuerit infra puluinem ad sanguinem.
Then he should make an incision on his arm so that the blood flows; and thus he should begin, and not draw the phlebotomy with his hand but the blood should pour him through the tube into the vessels which he has placed under the bed for the blood.Then he should tie the ligature with a bandage and wrap it twice.Et deinde faciat eum quod dicimus: et non omittat postea, sed iterum sanguis faciat in hoc modo, et teneatur ad finem passionis.
And let the bandage be moderate, for when the bandage is unequal or by the superfluity in the bandage then it prevents the course of blood; or in the softening, then also it prevents the course of blood.
Then after the bandage, the person to be bled should rub his hands together simultaneously until they become warm and the veins distend and become perceptible to touch.
Then the person bleeding should wash the spot with a little old olive oil.
Then he should put the index finger of his left hand over the vein in the place where he wants to bleed it a little, so that the vein does not escape and the blow is not wasted.
Because veins are like a fleeing chord upon bleeding; and among them is one that is full of windiness; and when you put the fleabane over it, it contracts under the fleabane, and the person bleeding is deceived, and does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is tight; therefore the phlebotomist should be firm, and pay attention to all these things.
Then put down the fleabane.Quidam uenam aperit, et non potest intrare intra eam: sed si ponat super illum locum ubi aperit phlebotomum, ubi est uena stricta, quod non potest intrare intra illum locum: et praeterit per stricturam, et per totum locum usque ad extremitatem.
And if not, then repeat that action in another place under the same spot, or above it with haste: if the place is not healed.
If it is healed, or the sickness becomes weak, then leave him for a day, or two days; and do not tighten the bandage.
For perhaps the ulcer will be drawn towards the heat.
Nor let him enter the bath.
Then he should undergo bloodletting, if he wishes.Et faciat frictiones cum oleo calido, et vino rubeo.
If the incision is small, or if blood flows out slowly and you are worried that the amount of blood coming out is excessive for your liking: then make another incision at the site according to its straightness, and add a little more to the procedure.
And do this with haste before the site is allowed to clot, for a clotted site is common among many people after a minor procedure.
If therefore you see that it has already clotten, then do not repeat over the site at all, for nothing will excuse you in this matter. And place something of the oil's dung over it, for it lessens the flow of blood.
And it is better in this instance than pure oil, and than other oils.Quod si uis facere ex faece olei pluris super locum, postea fac in quilibet locum post operationem aliquid ex faece olei.
If you wish to put more of the oil's dung over the site, then afterwards do so in every site after the procedure, something of the oil's dung.And likewise apply the oil's dung in all your phlebotomies, through which you phlebotomy veins during the prohibition of blood flow: and they make it of alfarach and sagzenea when one of these is placed over the site.
For blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.Et si facias in hac situ aliquid ex faece olei, quod sit super locum: postea fac ex ea super locum ex faece olei pluris aliquid.
And if a large clot happens at the site of phlebotomy, as it often does, especially with one who is not phlebotomized except for that occasion, or when the opening of the vein is small, then hasten and place over the site a sponge infused in water and salt, warmed somewhat: and hold it there for an hour, for it will be resolved.Et postea administre super locum faecem olei et sanguis fluens sublatur.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has come out of the vein itself, with its own complement, or from another vein.
And very often at phlebotomy there occur empyemas and protuberances.
Then put your hand over it; if you feel softness under your hand as you press on it, this protuberance is bad.
So beware that you put something over it of what we said above.
For perhaps blood will flow from it out of an artery.Et si fuit magnus pulsus, et non potest remittere, nec apud compressionem tuam super eam invenitur mollas, sed inveniuntur rigores: tunc scies quod illa eminentia est mala.
But make a plaster for him with what has astringency, that the place may harden.
Then treat him with the rest of the cure until he is healed.
And you ought to draw blood from every man according to the amount of his strength.
And what appears from the colour that is upon the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it turns red; and likewise, if you see that it is thick, then let it go until it becomes thin; and likewise, if it is sharp, then stop it until its sharpness is taken away.
And it is necessary for him who is full, strong and needs to have blood drawn out at one time, that the venesection of the vein be made large, and let the phlebotomist be wide; and the opposite of this is for him who is weak.
And it is necessary to draw him out in channels, and that the hole be tight; and it is better that what is administered in venesection of the vein be a transversal section not a puncture.Et si quaestus sanguinis excessit uoluntatem, et sanguis uenit ad faciem, tunc dimitte eum exire, nisi quaedam uigiliae sint, et facite subliminare.
And if the taking of blood exceeds the will, and the blood comes to the face, then let it go out; unless there are certain vigils, and make an emetic. And this mode of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from cutting a nerve: and it is more praiseworthy and safer than venesection through width and length.
And to whom it is usual to come upon phlebotomy syncopes, it is necessary that you feed him before phlebotomy with a little bread soaked in water of pomegranate grains; or secanabin, if it is warmed: and draw blood from him in three or four channels.
And if the complexion is frigid, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in myrrh syrup, or in scented syrup with spices, or in scented syrup.
If a syncope happens at phlebotomy, and the cause of it is the exit of much blood; then it is necessary that he take as a drink meat water and scented syrup, and use aromaticity with aloes, and liniment his chest with it; and use the rest which we said in division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.Et si quaestus sanguinis excessit uoluntatem, et sanguis uenit ad faciem, tunc dimitte eum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si apparet uigilia, donec discedat.
But whoever wishes to let blood from his arm and stop it with a second application, as is the case when there is a need for much evacuating and its strength is feeble, he should draw blood little by little according to the amount of his strength over continuous days.
But whoever wishes to let blood from his arm and stop it with a second application, and his body is strong: then he should do this after seven or nine hours from the first bloodletting.
But whoever wishes to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side to which it is leaning: he should let blood on the second or third day.
But if there is much hot blood in his body, and it is becoming acute, and causing fever to happen: you must let blood out of him at one time, and a great quantity should be extracted from him; and the opening should be enlarged until fainting happens: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy, and so that you put your hand on his pulse in the path of the blood, so that death does not happen in the place of fainting.
For it often happens that the phlebotomist ignores this and because of his negligence it falls.
And when you wish to stop the arm and stop blood with a second application, it is not right that the orifice of the vein should be closed and it becomes difficult for the blood to flow out; but that he should press on it strongly and stretch it quickly.
For this is very bad: indeed, cease from it until it is bled with a second application.Et non oportet facere uas sanguinem super faciem brachii post primam phlebotomiam: sed in die tertio faciatur de novo phlebotomia cum novis uasis.
Or remove with a sharp phlebotomy instrument that which has coagulated of blood in the orifice of the vein and place over it some dissolved salt in water.
And place over it something of teriaca alfaroch, or sagzenea, and place it with a light compression until the blood comes out.
But if indeed the vein is already closed, then leave it, and do not cut it until the clot is dissolved.
If necessity compels you to open the blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it above that place, or in another arm in another vein.Et postea dimitte, donec sedetur, et tunc trahe per aliam manum uenam aliam, vel si vis alibi;
And then let it be, until it is healed, and then draw through another hand a different vein, or if you wish elsewhere; but the arm is phlebotomized at the place of Fuscae, and Basilicae, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is that the sick person puts his hand into hot water until it turns reddish, and the vein appears manifestly.Et si non apparuit uena superius in brachio, sed est intrinsecus, tunc trahe per aliam manum ut supra;
And if the vein did not appear above in the arm, but is inside, then draw through another hand as above; Then it should be bound over it with a band with a slightly medium constriction.Et postea cum aqua frigida lave, et ponatur super ipsum compressio lenior, donec sedetur apostema.
Then wash it with cold water and place a lighter compression over it until the clot is dissolved; then phlebotomize a second time according to the transversion little by little, neither latitudinally nor according to length: and let there be an ample opening, and let your phlebotomy be where you phlebotomized over the joint of the hand a bit.
And indeed very often the course of blood is put into hot water in the time of winter.
And this vein's phlebotomy is safer for all veins because there is no pulsating vein or nerve under it.
Indeed, the phlebotomy of the right hand's Savatelle is associated with diseases of the liver.
And its quality is that you tie the Mahason of the hand with a ligament or your hand after you put it into hot water until the vein fills and shows itself strongly.
Then phlebotomize it by piercing across.
And if you hit it completely, it will not harm him at all.
And keep your hand with the phlebotomist from shaking.
For there are nerves under it naked of flesh from the fingers.
Then repeat the hand to hot water and let the blood flow in it.
For if you do not repeat it in hot water, the blood will coagulate at the opening of the vein and be prohibited from flowing.
When therefore you have taken out of the blood the quantity of necessity, then put over the vein oil and salt: so that it may not coagulate quickly.
And similarly, it is necessary to do with every bound branch.
Indeed, the point of phlebotomy out of the left hand is that it corresponds to diseases of the spleen: and similarly do phlebotomy on it as you did equally on the second.
But the point of phlebotomy out of the saphena vein is for diseases which are in the lower part of the body, like diseases of mothers, and retention of menstruation, and infirmities of kidneys, and ulcers of buttocks and thighs, and similar diseases.
And the quality of phlebotomy out of it is that a weak person puts his foot into hot water and makes friction over him until veins gush out, and ties above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
And indeed the location of the vein is next to the heel bone, appearing towards the thumb; and from it many branches go out into the face of the foot.
And indeed the location of the vein is next to the heel bone, appearing towards the thumb; and from it many branches go out into the face of the foot. Phlebotomy therefore on this in its larger branch, or near the calcaneus at its junction: for it is better and safer.
If indeed you phlebotomize on the face of the foot, then beware of nerves which are under it over the face of the foot.
And put your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize out of the cross, as if you wish to pierce it: and let the phlebotomist be Nesil.
And if indeed the exit of blood is prohibited, then repeat that foot in warm water: and let blood run into it, until it is evacuated.
If indeed the phlebotomist misses the vein on the first try, then he should go up a little with phlebotomy, for the place is safe, and you will not fear harm from it when you beware of nerves, as we said.
And likewise with the other leg's saphenous vein also.
But indeed the location of sciatic nerves, as we said, is next to the heel bone from the side of the forest.Et si quae cadit in facie pedis, et non potest remittere pedem, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper donec sciaticus transuersus sit.
And if indeed it falls into the face of the foot, and cannot send back the foot, then he should go up a little with phlebotomy until the sciatic nerve is crossed. And the treatment for phlebotomy of this is, to pain in the ankle, when it is because of warm blood.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is, to enter into a warm bath, and he hurried: and tighten the leg of it from the side of the ankle up to above the heel with four fingers, with a long slender rod: for indeed it does not appear except because of that.Et si quae cadit in facie pedis, et non potest remittere pedem, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper donec sciaticus transuersus sit.
When indeed it appears, then phlebotomize her according to whatever skill is possible for you, or according to its cross-section: and it is better, or to pierce it with an incision, or cut off its section.Et si quae cadit in facie pedis, et non potest remittere pedem, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper donec sciaticus transuersus sit.
For its location is healthier and it is very much hidden in most people.
If you don't find it and it does not appear at all to the senses: then phlebotomize some branch of it, and that is what appears on the back of the foot, and turned towards the ear: and beware of nerves, and make blood run in quantity as you wish.
Then loosen the ligature, and place on top of the phlebotomy spot some skin, and tighten the spot.
For it is quickly healed.
¶ Of Ventilation, and the quality of its use.
Chapter 98.
Wind-wounds are from horns, and from air, and from vitriol.
And ventilation indeed is done according to two ways.Unus est ex cornibus, idest, ubi ventosus procedit a parte ad partem: alius vero ex aere, idest, ubi ventosus procedit in medio.
One is from horns, that is, when the wind proceeds from one part to another: the other indeed is from air, that is, when the wind proceeds in the middle.With scarification and extraction of blood: and the other is ventilation without scarification.Quod quidem ventus procedit ex cornibus, et intrare solet per partes uulneri: et illa Ventosatio saepe est perniciosa. Now when the wind proceeds from horns and enters the wound's parts it is usually dangerous.And this ventilation which is without scarification is according to two ways.Unus est ubi procedit per partes uulneri: alius vero procedit in medio.
One is where it proceeds through the wound's parts: the other indeed proceeds in the middle.Or it is with fire.Et secundum modum etiam Ventosatio fit, utrumque modo.
And according to way ventilation is done, both ways.Or it is without fire.Quod quidem ventus procedit per partes uulneri: et haec Ventosatio saepe est perniciosa.
Now when the wind proceeds through the wound's parts: and this ventilation is often dangerous.And ventos that are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are fourteen locations in the body.In capite enim fit sub oculis pedibusque auricularum, et super uentrem.
Indeed in the head it is done below the eyes and the ears, and above the womb.Of these one is the ventilation of Alnocrati, and it is the last of the head: and Alkahil, and is in the middle of the neck: and the ventos of Alhagdahim, and are two lamina of the neck from its two parts simultaneously: and the ventos of the mind, and is below the mandible at the bottom of the mouth: and the ventos of two spatulae: and the ventos of Alachosos above the end of the tail: and the ventos of two knee-pits, and are in the middle of two arms: and the ventos of two crura: and the ventos of two shanks.
And fomentation indeed will not extract blood from the minute veins dispersed in the flesh and because of that fact strength does not depart from them as it does in the case of phlebotomy.
Nor is it necessary that fomentation be administered with fire or without fire in any diseases which come about because of fullness until the whole body has been evacuated.
If necessity compels us to administer fomentation because of sickness or out of habit, we give it at any time in the beginning of the month, in the end of it, and in its middle, and whenever we wish.
And the fact is that there are men in whom blood becomes multiplied within them until they need to have it extracted through fomentation and they experience headache and vertigo.Quilibet ergo qui habet illam indolem corporis, quae necessitatem impellit ad Ventosationem, si non uoluerit subire per uentosationem, oportet eum facere, ut per diuersas quaedam rationes uellet sanguinem in toto corpore.
Now anyone who has such a disposition of his body as compels him to undergo fomentation should not desire to undergo it, but he ought to make the blood flow through the whole body by various means.And some find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.
And of these some find itching in their face and forehead, darkness and dimness of sight.
And of these some have their wound discharge freely; while others have but little. And of these some laugh excessively, while others only slightly.
And of these some find the taste of blood in their mouth; or their tongue bleeds and they spit out blood.
And of these some sleep more than usual; while others less.
And of these some see in their dreams blood and wounds, and dead people, and similar things. When therefore we see anything of the above, and especially if it is during the third day of the month, we order that an incision be made after two or three hours have passed of that day. Now the wound of nuchae is: because it affects the gravity in the head, and what is poured out to the eyes.Et ventosas in illo loco, secundum necessitatem, faciendum est.
