On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter 68.
Often the skin of the testicles becomes softened in some men, whereby the flesh between them is softened, and its appearance is disfigured.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat it, to have the patient lie on his back, and to cut all the softened skin above the natural skin.
Then join the two edges with suturing: and if you wish, sew the excess of the softened skin at first with three or four stitches, and secure the suture.
Then cut between the sutures.
Then treat it with the care for other wounds, until it is healed and the threads fall out.
