Chapter Fifty-Two.
On Cauterizing the Corrosive Ulcer.
The corrosive ulcer is a corruption that spreads in the limb, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood. If you see the corrosive ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization by fire, heat many nail-shaped cauteries, small and large, according to what is appropriate for the place where the corrosive ulcer is.
Then cauterize it from every side until all of the corruption is eradicated and nothing of it remains at all. Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the eschar and all the corruption are removed.
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth. If you see after three days that the flesh is growing healthily without corruption, then [stop]. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupt areas.  The corrosive ulcer can also be treated with a potent medication.
It takes the place of fire, being faster-acting. I have mentioned its treatment with potent medication in the division, so take it from there when you need it.
