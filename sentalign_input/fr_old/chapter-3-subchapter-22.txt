Of the limb twisted after healing
When the limb is twisted after healing, and the fractured bone is visible, and the shape of the limb is ugly, although it does not lose its natural function: do not believe the fools who say the limb must be broken anew, and many foolish physicians have done this in our land; this method is criticized, and causes great harm, and sometimes death; however, if the callus and twisting are fresh, they should be washed with warm water, or cooked softening herbs, such as mallow leaves, roots, and melilot, and similar things; and make a softening poultice, such as well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of mallow, and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and apply the poultice; or take fat figs, and mash them with cow dung, and similar medicines that reduce the hardening.
And sometimes the callus is removed by continuously and long rubbing with moist hands. And administer movement to the limb every hour.
And if the twisting is old and hardened, like a stone, and needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut down to the bone, with a light subtle chisel; and put care and effort into the treatment.
