When the tears from the eyes are old and habitual and are on the veins, or next to the arteries that are on the outward appearance of the head; and it is seen that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make the cautery that I mentioned at the beginning of the water descending to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries in the hinder part below the two bones; and if more is needed, then cauterize lightly above the eyebrow with a small cautery.	When tears are constantly in the eye and arise on account of the arteries and veins visible on the outside of the head, and you are sure that they are from cold thick phlegmatic superfluities, burn him with the very cautery that I taught for the beginning of cataract, namely, a cauterization in the middle of the head and two on the temples, and two on the back of the neck below the two bones; and, if you are compelled to add more, one cauterization on the side of the outer corner of each eye at the end of the eyebrow, with a small cautery.	0.9005139
