 CHAPTER TWO.
On the incision of the occipital arteries.
 When a person gets painful defluxions into the eyes or chest which become chronic, and medical treatment is ineffectual in this case, then section of these arteries will be the most efficacious treatment.
When you decide on section, you should shave the patient's head with a razor; then rub the place with a rough cloth to show up the artery; then bind the patient's neck with an end of his garment; then you will observe where the artery is pulsating (the sites of both are the depressions behind the ears) for it is uncommon for them to remain hidden, except in a few persons.
Then do you mark with ink over both; then cut with a hooked scalpel, cutting down to the bone; the incision should be lateral to the head.
Or if you prefer, introduce the scalpel beneath the artery and make a thrusting cut up at it.
The incision should be of about two fingers' breadth.
When cut, the artery gives out a pulsating jet of blood spurting intermittently.
If the artery is not discernible, you should measure three fingers' breadth from the ear, than mark with ink, and cut down to the bone.
The quantity of blood that should be let is six ounces on the average, but often more blood, or less, is withdrawn; all in proportion to the strength of the patient and the fullness of the arteries as they appear to you.
Then examine the wound and if there remains on the bone any part of the membrane cut it off to avoid a haematoma.
Then bind up the wound with a bandage of linen cloth and dress with ointments till healed.
