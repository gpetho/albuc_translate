 CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN.
On the cauterization of a cold liver.
 When there is pain in the liver from cold and humidity or from thick vapour, so there is a severe disturbance of its natural constitution, and the patient has been treated as prescribed in the appropriate section but with no effect, the patient should lie back, and you should mark with ink the places of three cauterizations, in this form and exactly of this size below the costal cartilages, where the elbow reaches.
Let there be a finger's breadth between each pair of cauterizations and let the burning be straight along the length of the body.
Do not press the cautery hard with your hand.
Let the thickness of the skin you burn be half its thickness, not more; and let the patient be standing on his feet during the cauterization.
 Alternatively he may be recumbent with legs outstretched and arms raised.
Figure of the cautery.
You will also be able to do these cauterizations with the edged cautery when you have craft and facility in the art.
Be careful lest you go too deep with the cautery and burn the whole thickness of the skin and the abdomen and penetrate to the intestine, for the skin there is thin; bear this in mind.
