Oh children, you have completed this book of mine, which lies at the heart (literally 'the end' or core) of medical science due to your praise and through my expositions and declarations; I see that you understand this treatise divided by operation/surgery.
When the operation is prostrated in our region and time, entrusted to me due to my knowledge of it, I see nothing but small descriptions in free Ancient texts; these I correct and adapt them so that their intentions are clear, and thus lengthen understanding and refine art.
Here comes the sentence to translate: "And I have seen that you understand this tractate in accordance with its second part regarding explanation and demonstration as well as abbreviation; for these are necessary forms of tools used by cauters and other instruments, which cause necessity.
Here is the line by line translation of the medieval medical treatise:
Through Aqua of Hippocrates who knows his name is power, may in the small workings it does mainly in the art of medicine.
May we already have told you of that in the entrance to this free space; who do not know what we have told them about anatomy, will fall into error and thus harm themselves unnecessarily, as they might from hearing only some aspects of these things which are formed within this science and extracted through it.
Here is the line-byse translation of this medieval medical treatise:
And another doctor ordered that the patient drink a stone from a homely place where it had been processed within him and was large, so they drained this stone through a tube of the bladder, and thus the homey substance expired in three days.
When you call upon that (a substance or entity), and because of the greatness of the stone and the disposition of the bladder, it comes undernethy where death will occur.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another doctor took his salary from our landlord as payment for surgery; and came with a black instrument that was used because there was a fracture in the patient'dict leg, which he set without looking at it (breathing deeply into the wound), on dirt, pillows, or chairs of strong structure.
Here you return the ligaments according to your wishes, and fix them in place with straps during certain days as directed by us; this is when the thigh and buttock are outside of the socket joint, leading to dislocation.
And you called upon him (the doctor), and provided instruments to remove the ligaments, achieving relief and easing of your pains.
Even though decay has been confirmed in the limb, so it cannot be restrained and will not stop roaming within while under the malady'supreme condition (presence of illness).
Here comes another doctor who pierced an ulceration, and it became inflamed within days; meanwhile, the cunning of him grew towards becoming his lord (or master).
The cause is that the skull needs to be treated for melancholalgy; not because it comes into contact with everything around them, but rather, it's the member where they have been held throughout their life.
For this sentence in the medieval medical treatise, here is an attempt at translation into English line by line with consideration for its somewhat archaic language structure:
Here comes the first sentence to translate: E yeu ja he exsitat aquo en tot loc de aquest libre en le qual venc opperacio en la qual es error e temor; per que necessari es a vos que guardetz aquo e layssetz aquel, per que les folhs no atrobo via a parlar e a vos desonestar.
Therefore take up your weapons for solicitude and protection from God, and let your illness suffer defeat and cessation of pain.
Here comes the translation of each line into English:
When gouty pains occur in some of its manifestations," or "When signs of gout appear in some forms: Not a physician suffers from melancholy, for such doctors cannot be named.
And you have already read this book for the second time three chapters.
Begins the division of free space, and first from the primary section. The ordered first chapter within the body weight, in terms of instruments and iron tools for caustics, what is required therein.
La division of the second section. The Second Chapter on cautery and perforation, as well as pills, poultices, extraction of herbs and similars for those purposes, has been arranged and ordered according to the forms of these instruments.
The third part of restoration and displacement, as well as treatment for twisting and appearance to these individuals; the table ordered within their bodies under the feet, and forms established by instruments.
At that point begins the assessment of how well those treatments and herbs affect his body's health (or "cauterize" in Latin refers to heating or burning something as a form of treatment), focusing on their quality, with explicit restrictions placed upon such cauterizations.
Thus the conversation about the quality of health for those treatments and herbs is lengthy and detailed (suggesting an in-depth discussion on their effects), subtle according to knowledge, yet secretly guarded; they speak greatly among themselves about it, but there's disagreement within them. To me enough has been communicated—the prolongation of this dialogue would not benefit my understanding due to these internal disputes and secrecy surrounding the information (implying that despite hearing some parts of their discussions, I don’t fully grasp everything because they are reluctant or selective in sharing what is known among them).
Thus it is said that the treatment applies universally throughout all components of matter or substance (indicating a broad application), with exceptions to two complexes—these are parts at the base/end of his body's structure. It implies these particular areas might require different attention due to their foundational and terminal roles in bodily composition, which could influence how treatment is applied there versus other regions where it’s universally effective (pointing out that while a general approach works for many parts, special consider
In the tail and dry parts of matter there is disagreement; some argue that treatments are beneficial for those areas due to their quality and lack of moisture, while others counter this viewpoint because it's unsuitable in cases where these properties—quality being goodness or excellence, combined with a state of desiccation (dryness) —are present. It leads them to believe that if the wet part associated with those areas is cauterized and dried as treatment, this would be inconvenient for maintaining health since it's against nature: quality implies refinement or purity while dryness suggests a lack of something necessary (usually moisture). Thus any artificial attempt to correct the wet part by means such as heating might not align with natural conditions and could prove detrimental rather than beneficial. Here, there's recognition that treatments must be appropriate for each specific situation; what works or is advisable in one case (the tail/dry parts) may contradict another approach necessary when addressing different symptoms associated elsewhere due to opposing natural conditions—highlighting the
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Through his speech, it has been told me that at times I have already discovered some things myself.
Even though there is no way to excise the one already assessed and subjected to cautery exergy in today's exercise of instruments, we understand the complexity of human composition and how diseases manifest within them, as well as their causes and accidents; also acknowledging the time span for these occurrences.
May also in other complexities there is not fear, and mostly in the chilly phlegmatic humors where doctors are already agreed upon these matters, without concern for bleeding while performing cauterization on those very things.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May the medicine ignite for that which has lain in his body and bring it to life thereof; strengthen also its ill member with difficulty of healing, and drive outwardly from within him as well.
May the focus, due to its sublimity and nourishing substance, does not make it excessive; already we understand by experimentation and long-term service in studying this art about truth of causes—and thus you are excused from lengthy discourse here during our pause. And now that I am at your leisseon within these moments to share my secret knowledge on the focus, which demonstrates through surgical intervention for removing diseases and its philosophic elucsion demonstrated in speech will strengthen your bones (or teeth).
And wise men understand that it is best in early spring for performing cauterizations and intervals of rest.
Even says that cautery is convenient at all times, in such a way that the harm caused by water retained within it after application of the cautery disappears, and mainly if for pains or necessary painful sensations, which do not suffer delays due to fears about what comes out during its expulsion; this greater potential damage entering over time is worse than smaller immediate injury.
So do not sit on your thighs or feet; ordinary people and simple physicians only estimate them in relation to this illness that heals through caustics but cannot be completely removed at once, resulting in these consequences.
The cause is not due to what they eat for water (possibly referring to fluid intake or a dietary imbalance), and cauterization is only done in the place of medicine that changes complexity and dries out the humours which are causing pain.
Even though there may be excessive use of the lancet in medicine due to its necessity and grandeur commanded by one'thy lord, it is essential for treatment with caution.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Even though vulgar speech may be the remedy used in medicine and is directly related to healing without involving external sources that I do not understand, as they are beyond medical knowledge or any other cause for which caution must be exercised with these instruments of treatment.
E the cause is contrary to water; and I understand that cautery (medicine) for some illnesses is only used when administered by a physician's hand at the last resort, and this intervention addresses the root of the problem directly where it originates. And when it comes time for the last application of medicine as understood by common sense and various doctors' practices, then:

The cauterization will confer humidity and coldness on the accident wound of which you suffer due to sodium chloride (salt) in excessive amounts along with body fluid accumulation, caused by lying down too much time causing edema, constipation or similar issues. This leads to pain such as joint discomfort, gout from urine retention and dental/gum problems; these are common maladies associated with coldness in the body which can also result in paralysis (paresis), hardening of limbs (sclerosis) or stroke-like conditions.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: initially command the patient to expel what must be removed through medicine via vomiting for three or four days, according to the intensity of the prolapse and the age of the individual and their customs.

When there is chronic and long-lasting pain throughout the body, using swords and scrapes along with chairs and cupping devices, as well as electrical currents (possibly referencing various forms of traditional therapies), primarily if any such treatment has already been conducted on that portion; moreover, consider it only when there is a strong calcification in the nature of this swelling—do not harm greatly or cruelly. Should you have previously cauterized with an instrument upon which some form of these treatments was applied (implying perhaps using similar tools for different therape extraneous causes), now apply another such treatment to that specific spot, holding their hands in the process as a precautionary measure against unintended consequences. Return that above the patient's head for cauterization, within which the intestine is cut apart. Cut the tongue and expose its quantity as we have counted and sealed it with a cauterizing tool at the back part of the head wherein lies that which is being called upon by you, namely, this location in which suction (aspiration) takes place—this is where. And lift your hand so high, and do not touch the abdomen, for it inflicts great pain different from that of other caustic procedures on the head.

From your given Latin text, the English translation would be as follows:
When severe pain occurs in the head or when it is protruded outwardly at the neck, extract remedies with the physician' extricating tool and administer another treatment as described for diseases; otherwise, cauterization will be performed here using two tools: acute combustion medicine or iron.

Return the pause over the location of pain, and hold your hand—so that it is not dragged out (which has already happened), turning slowly with velocity.
If the amount of blood that is extracted through the speculum inserted into the vein prevents your hand from being hurt, hold it there to ensure that the artery does not get cut and bleeding occurs, thus preventing bile flow outwardly.

When treating ancient migra the poultice that we have discussed for healing, and what has been mentioned about its treatment of diseases; without properly applying these treatments or failing to administer them as prescribed by traditional medicine (either external cautery or internal caustic), occasionally leaving a residue from previous cauterizations. Place this poultice over the area where pain is present, along which long line it dictates its extent; and rest your hand upon that spot for some time within these strikes of iron—meaning you are applying pressure directly to the site causing discomfort or ailment:
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuous movement of the jaw joint which grinds teeth (bruxism), and that the looseness does not tighten up nor affect those nerves involved in causing this condition, so as not to provoke spasms.
If it is about the custody and caution of the flow from where the artery begins, there is fear in its origin, mostly to that which does not know what makes it happen and does not study it; perform the operation at once.

When you treat that particular kind of torture and cleaning away urine and stone passages, without discomfort in your care, then when curing the patient's bloated abdomen with three cauterizations: take iron from the hairpin, use a small piece for its temple as needed, and lime joints between two lips.
And apply pressure with the hot cautery where the ill-conditioned parts are located; there it will only soothe when that sick area appears healthy again.
The method of cauterization is that you apply the instrument for cauterizing directly on the tip of the sharp knife at the end of the extremity of the right hand, and in the temple; its length corresponds to the height of your arm, holding it inside until enough has been applied to burn out what was extracted from the bone hole.
This is how it's done with a pointed cautery, and this form belongs specifically to the practitioner of cupping (chuan pao). Here they sit nowad0to perform their art. Mayhaps I subtly place that which has scarcely come upward, and remove from the body what is excessive growth.

Here "cauterizes" suggests using heat treatment on designated spots along their heads. It appears as though this medieval approach involves targeted thermal applications, perhaps for curing diseases perceived in that era through the manipulation of body temperature and localized bodily response to such interventions. The specificity with which different head sections are addressed indicates an understanding (or presumption) about their roles or properties concerning health within And there is space between each of these instruments, and pay close attention to this instrument'dict water that flows from it.

So, we must clear the mind of this person with regard both to past and present remedies that have been prescribed during times when melancholy was considered grand (significant) or tolerable in terms of medical practices before addressing excesses beyond accepted cures as outlined at its division. This suggests a holistic approach where historical understanding, psychological factors like lethargy ("melancholy"), and current remedies are all taken into account to treat conditions considered outside the standard scope or deemed too extreme for conventional medicine of that era (phrenology is hinted here). The text indicates an integration of
If it is an infant who does not suffer from the medicines administered, apply liniments and poultices to maintain mindfulness for a day or so at least by careful feeding of good foods (indicating that dietary adjustments can be as crucial in healing as direct treatments). This advice emphasizes attentiveness not just towards the application of remedies, but also their timing and quality—significantly acknowledging nutrition' extraction from a medical text for holistic care. The use of liniments (topical applications

Also burn wicks over each point thereupon formed above any part (top) of this person's skull where it has been previously suggested for treatment with heat or burning agents—a clear reference in medieval texts that certain parts of the body are targeted specifically to treat various ailments, here likely indicating an understanding and manipulation of symptoms through localized thermal interventions.

The provided Latin-like phrase can be translated as: "For the drainage of water from the wound." This sentence suggests a medical treatment or procedure for addressing fluid
When you declare the presence of water in the wound as stated by your senses during division, it begins and gives relief to the patient'dictio through a poultice applied atop which ensures that all moisture is contained within its bounds for healing purposes. Here "aygua" refers to bodily fluids typically found exuding from wounds (likely serous or pus-like fluid), and addressing this condition would have been essential in medieval medicine as well, emphasizing containment ("guardar") of the moisture within a controlled area for proper healing. This line indicates an understanding that managing drainage is critical to prevent further complications such as infection or excessive loss of bodily

This line translates to: "And it orders the patient's head, and cauterizes that area with a caustic applied where there is dampness in the skull; additionally, if both drains of water are present at two places on the head or just one place (a tongue), then apply as many times necessary to each respective spot." Here "cauterize" refers to using heat or chemical agents directly over affected areas such as skin lesions that contain moisture. This reflects an era when cauterization was a common treatment for wounds and infections, aiming at drying out the offending area (in this case involving dampness potentially indicative of abscesses or other fluid accumulations). The specificity with which different draining conditions are treated underlines medieval medicine's attempt to tailor treatments according to observable symptoms. This treatment undersc0ns

This passage describes an old medical practice where urine was considered to contain harmful elements like hairs from outside that needed removal—likely in preparation for some form of treatment or cleansing, potentially related to syphilis with its characteristic chancre and accompanying symptoms including hyperemic sores (inflamed areas) around the nails. The instructions appear outlandish by modern standards but reflect a historical attempt at treating infectious diseases like STIs before antibiotics were available, using rudimentary tools for extractive procedures or as

Furthermore, when pauses are placed on the bite mark in a lambskin or water vessel, the lead adheres to the fistula location and heals it marvelously through curative magic (healing power).
If the fistula is healed by the water we have applied from cautery and treatment, then all is well; but if not, it is necessary to administer pus removal and reduce the fistula on the nose as soon as possible in its proper place.

The provided text appears to be from an old medical treatise discussing
Regarding the treatment of teeth and softening of gums,
When the veins are softened by humidity and the teeth become enlarged, treat those with medicine without applying pressure; then pause at the head of the malady in the thighs so that you can apply fire to the cautery shaped for it as quickly as possible. This ensures that when you press on the swelling over the tooth and insert into this caustic instrument, the mouth' extruding abscess is brought by its heat from the focus of the dental infection back up through the cheek tissue where treatment can occur effectively.
Return your hand (and return), and apply the points of the cautery as many times as you wish.

When tooth pain is due to inflammation or infection (fever), if the treatment does not comfort as per medicine's care instructions, then cautioning measures are taken twice: either burning at cow borders ('borders of a mouth') with cautery tools, or on the spot where discomfort occurs.
Cauterize the border that you grip on cows and flasks within the hearth of iron, and grasp and wrap it over the extremity of the torch being consumed by fire; hold onto this border as well as any other at bay with a cord or rope to prevent its ignition.
Return the intestine or hernia back into its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from protruding until the heat of the focus reaches the state of the teeth.
If you wish, submerge wool or cloth below it there, and place that above the sore tooth, and over that which is already lit within the cavity of the affected tooth until the metal reaches it.
May the cauterization performed on the focus be that you attend to either iron ore or steel (the materials used for cautery), and if any swelling occurs in the chest, it should not reach the mouth of the malady.
Return the cautery to its shape, and place it on your teeth so that the cautery is heated up; let there be a few uses when the pain returns in your mouth or today or tomorrow.
When that instrument of the cautery moves and widens (the patient'sin mouth), holding it there for an hour, this is how the use of the cauterization proceeds.
And if you can perform it as directed by what is necessary for cautioning (cauterizing), do so accordingly with your ability.

And if you have applied the caustic substance to this specific point within your stomach, and wish for additional points as desired—apply cauterization here too; also ensure that whatever treatment has been previously administered is concluded before proceeding with further healing. This passage advises a sequential approach where any pre-existing caustic application on the abdomen must first be neutralized, after which additional localized points can undergo cauterization following your preference for quantity and extent of treatment within that specific area (stomach). It highlights not just an individualistic or case-by-case methodology but also a layered approach to caustic application where timing between procedures is crucial.

Of gout and joint pain treatment.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And when gout due to cold excess is healed without further attacks of pain, the applied poultices are not renewed.
When you are treating that particular excretion in the circulation of the knee joint, it involves using caustics within and outside the treatment area for therape extrusion control.
This is where such a tool of this kind exists:
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed instrument for puncture. If pain enters the joints or other conjoints, and motion causes them movement inside, it is necessary that we burn this over any one of three or four points with our caustic at these places for treatment.
If you have the necessary lancets for these lancets, then apply them to that required one without pressing your hand on it beforehand; simply send forth with the instrument of the catheter.
If pain enters both shoulders, then administer the points for which we have previously mentioned in our chapter.
If the pain is only in the waist and thighs alone, then it's called sourness; when it comes into circulation like a rolling flame, make points along those two lines.
If there are residual pains in the joints, then points will be made on the circumference of each node and around the nipple.
If pain reaches down into the hips or muscles on certain days, then you will burn all of their joints with cautery.

When there is an opening in the joints and points are directed downwards towards the navel, it begins with applying pressure as you instructed for your patient to eat locally available materials on their own body today using gentle causes so that the fissure inside of them does not worsen. Here "rompuredura" refers to a tear or opening in this context; hence cauterizing such breaks is necessary, particularly when directed toward sensitive areas like joints and possibly hernias (implied by mentioning 'belly'). The text suggests that the practitioner should apply pressure with specific directions ('layssart' – likely refers to a type of bandage or support) made from what’s available locally. This approach is intended as immediate self-care, presumably following traditional home remedies consistent in medieval times for dealing with such injuries before any form of surgical inter
Follow the intestine within your body along its path towards your chest and command it to hold itself in place where there is an opening or a hernia appears, using tape as needed for support (referring possibly to applying a bandage).

The practitioner suggests that if further intervention beyond pressure and observation is required due to an opening or hernia, they should use tape as necessary for support —

Observe carefully the fire of the intestine at the time of your cautery, to ensure that it does not spill out onto the thighs or cause a greater harm.

When pain persists in the upper body for a long time and does not relieve itself with care from physicians, it is said that caustic treatment at points on the skin will provide relief through deliberate scarring or burning (cauterization). Here "Capitol .xlvi." likely refers to an ancient Roman medical text where this remedy for tumors might be discussed.
Both large and small members (body parts) should undergo caustic treatments according to their size and developmental stage; areas of the body affected by tumors are treated accordingly with cauterization techniques for local pain relief or removal. Here "Capitol .xlvi." likely continues as a reference in ancient Roman texts, where such medical procedures might be described more extensively.
So if the first caustic treatment is sufficient (bo es), but otherwise repetition of such treatments may be necessary; according to custom for these pains, points are made on a limb that approaches its cavity so that subsequent cauterizations can occur within it. Here "Capitol .xlvi." likely continues with further details or instructions from an ancient medical text about the procedure and principles of repeated caustic treatment as part of holistic pain management in Roman medicine.
Continuing to 'Capitol .xlviii.' implies we are moving on

Ultimately place the cautery inside until it is imbedded in the bone, and thus are the displaced scars moved away from there so that thick vapors can exit out of them; then caulk over the wound as prescribed.
If leprosy has already spread over the thigh and shows signs of manifestation, then cover it with those cauterises you have in your head; apply them to the extremity of the nose, two on each leg (where worm infestations occur), two on both lumbar vertebrae, one large for thoracic vertebrae, another over the shoulder blade and a second covering various ankles—two per ankle with cauterises at hand; cover all joints of legs/feet entirely as well as any toe present therein.
Guard your nerves that are above the ankle so they do not burn these.
Some treatments involve applying a pointed cautery to the bones of the pelvis and another on the mouth of the stomach, as well as one for the womb (uterus).

Translation: And then you would also perform the complete cauterization of it, removing entirely all traces of decay and not leaving any cause for further illness behind at that spot within which full removal is desired to eraddict (meaning completely remove) every trace of corrosion. Here, medieval doctors were advised or instructed on thoroughly cleansing
Translation: And allow it three days of rest on the cauterized locations, with oil mixed within which all scars shall be entirely removed and decay fully eliminated from thereafter at those places where complete healing is sought after. This suggests a treatment regimen in medieval times that included not just immediate intervention like cauterization but also allowed for recovery time coupled possibly with the use of ointments or poultices designed to aid wound repair and eliminate decay over multiple days, indicating an understanding of post-treatthy healing processes.

From the treatment of ulcers and their healing derived by means of pressure points on the head.
When the old man comes carrying catharsis and continues doing so, and at times the humors of the malady expand, causing their face ulcerations and hair loss due to wounds from inside vessels stemming from various parts of the body they have departed; moreover, here is wisdom for these accidents that materials and catharsis do not come solethy except through blood flow in those veins.
And the best cure for these is: to command the humors that constitute its nature, and inscribe on that spot where it lies in the forehead'se location a small crack; thus insertion occurs within bone (and entrance into right temple by left jawbone; entry into bone itself), until the bone is revealed.

And when blood flows out of the ear or appears like these causes that do not fit in the ear, hold the ear towards the sunlight and if you see blood coming out, administer its removal and perform cauterization for healing wounds once they have been stitched up. Here comes the first sentence to translate:
If it is not expelled internally, then apply external removal using the subtle instruments referred to here.
If there is a bump (probably referring to an abscess or localized swelling), be it so; otherwise, administer its removal gently over time using small and repeated applications of pus extraction.
So if there is not an opening (forum-getada), then make and insert a reed into the hollow of the artery, seal it tightly with wax and oil that has been softened by heat so that only the reed remains intact. When drained with cold air from above and below it is gathered strongly due to what we have collected together today.
If there is no treatment for this condition (the term 'foro-getada' might refer to some form of therapy or intervention), then take half the lamp oil or parts from that which are pressed by leather straps, pause it at the end of the limb and cover it carefully. Return that into the obstruction of the artery and remove thence any excess moisture from it.
And if it is the cause of all things we have mentioned before, then take care to treat that which comes forth immediately with caution or restraint measures for inflammation or spasm.

The patient then inserts their hand dipped in this chilled mixture into the part of their genitalia corresponding to that area with stones or small boulders above them; they jump onto these placed objects for treatment. Thus cease your touch upon the rock where all water has been drawn out, which means that one should stop applying pressure or handling on a specific spot (likely referring to an area of discharge) until all the fluid has drained away from it.

Mayhem originates from the extraction of evil spirits in the artery, when you treat that water which we have mentioned earlier in division and flow during distillation processes without accompanying your treatment with sunlight attention; thus, watch over the artery to ensure healing.
Therefore if there appears any cause of worms here, extract that with gentle hands or small tools, may it not appear; otherwise take a catheter drawn up and inserted below the area for this is its form. And insert the delicate extremity into the artery according to the quantity that suffering may cause in the malady; and draw out blood from it with great suction, doing so repeatedly until all parasites are expelled within their holes (or wormholes).
May if you do not obey my instruction, then you will swell and close in the circuit of the catheter with wax used during our session; administer these remedies that have already been applied to ancient parasites in their treatment, thus removing them from the tract of distillation.
And if it is your effusion that you are addressing, through which the remedies enter in this instrument of yours, here they take form.

When you treat burns acutely as described and not healed yet, they are in no way cured here but rather divided over the ulceration to be matured; remove completely all the moisture where it is trapped inside so that bone may emerge." This translation attempts to convey a complex medical procedure from medieval Latin into modern English. Here's an attempt at translating each segment:
And when you discover the bone and it is in decay or ruin, then this becomes its form of a support for which these are.

If during ligament stretching it is softened, then that which causes pain will ease off.

This phrase translates to: "That illness, which is called waterlogging in the body's resemblance to being washed away and not that." In this context from medieval medical literature, it appears they were describing a condition similar to what modern medicine might refer to as edema or swelling due to fluid accumulation. The term 'alconati' indicates an understanding of excess water in the body affecting health ("malaut
This complex Latin medical phrase can be translated into English as follows: "It is the action of letting outward whereby a seeping humoral excess occurs on an applied device (likely referring to some form of diagnostic or therapeutic apparatus), and you should lay your hand upon its head, taking hold at those two extremities that show signs whenever illness comes near through these portals. You must dry it thoroughly with the hands left therein; do not let any moisture remain—let no water enter from outside (presumably into this device or area being addressed). Hereby you are to eliminate the external light, and thereby expel humoral excess as soon as possible once detected inside.
If it does not fall into its place (likely referring to a body part returning or descending as expected), you understand that there is water involved (possibly indicating fluid accumulation). Here

When in the nose various forms of flesh are nascent from which no cause arises that assembles into scorpion or polyps, and this illness is likened to these pains represented by such beings; it is called polypus—this condition named for its resemblance.

And of it flesh is blackened or putrid in hue; and from the same there emerges a yellowish substance that makes its way out into places where meat does not reside, which means outside (or beyond) normal tissues—a discoloration signifying decay. Herein lies contrast: within these regions of affliction no ordinary flesh
Thus in these places where no deceitful flesh or blackness exists within them (suggesting an absence of cancerous growth), make the womb move between your legs and expose it to sunlight, while you draw blood from those regions—this indicates a treatment approach using light exposure possibly for detoxification purposes as per medieval medical theory. Herein lies contrast: outside these affected areas no harmful flesh exists that requires such intervention (indicating the belief in cleansing or curative power of sunlight on purifying afflicted tissues). Extract that from the main parts of the body where you understand all flesh is suspended; if there's a cause in your patient for which abscission (separation) may be possible, then extract what you have understood from these causes using one of the delicate instruments available to facilitate this action within them.

When on the surface of both incisor and molar teeth, there are sharp points or ridges; along these edges, yellow (citrine) or green stains can appear due to decay that reaches up into the gums. These discolorations occur when dental plaque progresses beyond what is visible within the mouth cavity, leading to deterioration and subsequent pigmented lesions on the teeth where they come in contact with inflamed gingiva (gums).

The text details concerns regarding dental procedures wherein not only must care be taken to remove the affected teeth without causing additional pain ("dolor"), but also ensuring that any accompanying discomfort does not hinder recovery. It underscores a holistic approach within these treatments, suggesting an underlying principle of restoring balance or sublime substances for healing purposes during dental extractions (eradicacio de lu).

Some days it is cured by water that has been subtly applied with caustic and incision, whereby the treatment takes place in this method: recipe for steam baths using yarrow, sage, rue, Arabian scars, chamomile, rosemary, broth, and similimum herbs to all of these causes or some of them. All are submerged into a vessel filled with water; there is bubbling over the top layer where an instrument made from rammed stone according to this treatment method rests on it for fomenting purposes. The poultice may be silver, or another metal.
And place it within the mouth of the malady until the breath rises to the palate and causes the uvula to become dimmed.
Here applies pressure on that moisture remaining within where it has become dry, and ensure you do not perform this treatment while the patient is consuming food or drinks; otherwise, adjustments will be needed for the application of stones (lithotripsy), which should only occur after obtaining consent from the stone itself.
May it not be that you do not have this instrument with you? Then take a can and place the mouth of the malady outside its exterior boundary by making an enclosure using hay, so that the mouth of the malady is comfortably covered; for then the smoke from burning hay will prevent the mouth of the malady from being burned.
This treatment is good for health.
In order to provide an accurate translation of this medieval medical treatise text with a line-
From the extraction of thorns and any other causes that are stuck in the gouty area (gout refers to joint pain often associated with uric acid crystal deposits). Here, "Capitol" appears as a heading or reference within this context which might denote page number
Continuing regularly stuck in the gouty area, possibly due to thorns or nails on the foot, or any other cause. Here "Motas" could refer either to repeated irritations ("motions") like walking frequently with embedded objects such as splinter
And therefore you remove the water that is obviously present from above it (the visible affected area), placing your tongue with an implement by the sunlight, to confirm if this fluid is indeed in the gouty condition ("gula"). Here "cove" means cover or concealment; removing layers such as skin blisters often seen together with severe joint pain associated with uric acid deposits. The use of sight and touch (via a tongue instrument) aligning with medieval medical practices for diagnosis where the doctor would observe symptoms directly to determine their cause, suggesting an early form of clinical exam
And if the water is not visible and it's concealed in the gouty area, then make a slurry with malady urine that arises when food decays in the stomach; or drainage of marsh mud (likely referring to some form of natural clay), rasped pea shell pieces, pebbles from loam soil—all applied forcefully and firmly. These are used as part of a treatment process that involves introducing these mixtures through the chest wall into where spines or thorns have been extracted; afterwards those same materials will be pushed back (transgussed) under them, so once they've come out at their location in relation to what was removed from your body. Here "foro-getada" implies a method of internal drainage possibly similar to cupping therapy or the use of enemas for purging; and this ancient practice would involve manipulating substances into one’thy chest cavity as part of an amputation's aftercare, suggesting that medieval medicine sometimes resorted to combining practical remedies with spiritual rites. The text describes a multi-step treatment which includes inducing vomiting (perhaps seen as necessary for cleansing), creating specific concoctions from natural materials gathered around the home or nearby environment—and then reapplying them therapeutically, indicative of holistic approaches to healing in that era. May take a snake and bind it with faithful rope, or may extract the intestine and cauterize therewith on tablet and spit as medicine; or use a pore and apply thereto also to remove things from their throat.
If not through examination of these causes have we ascertained them, then use a chisel according to this form.
And if it is a large mass that enters into its cavity, the one you insert therein for ease of drainage.
And lift his head up on their shoulders, and make sure that the touch of your hands is at the neck or backbone area, so he can breatde to you again with ease into breathing air and exhalation for what I have asleep him (the doctor).
Even though the malady enters therein and identifies its cause location with signs of pain in that place, by virtue of their knowledge it invokes them to draw out the instrument accordingly according to how much they have prepared within this threshold (preparedness).
The provided text appears to be an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise
From the extraction of sanquiguasuga (presumably referring to gallstones) attached to the gallblad0r:
When the bloodletting fluid that we have discussed in the division of cure and medicine does not comfort you, consider then turning to the gallbladthy (a term possibly referring to bile or related organ) within the area where discomfort is felt on the side opposite the sunrise, provided you already possess a tool prepared for this purpose.
Then if you find a splinter or small movements beneath carefully and gently extract it.
If it is not possible to remove that, take a concave cannula and insert it into the groin of the patient; place a heated iron pin in the concavity of the cannula, and expel as many drops (so long as the sycgenesis is dead and stays away from the inguinal region) to prevent the swelling for the entire day.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If there is no water to wash away the medicine that we have prescribed, then cleanse (or purify) the abdomen with a cloth or naphtha as used in steam bathing for this purpose.
When it is necessary (If), points must be made over the surface of the foot with a pointed instrument (a sharp tool).
And when it is necessary (If), performing an operation for absorption of that substance involves grasping the vessel containing hot air and its cover; insert your tool into this container trap; remove from underneath heating, placing above where gas enters through a small hole—this opening being sealed with another object. Then lift out beneath warming until you feel it has reached (reached) below wound's surface, at which point the patient lifts their mouth to bite on the end of the cannula; and hold tightly so that absorption through heating does not occur within what one knows as "the operation site," wherein now heat penetration has reached it.
If not already done, then perform the subfumigation movements repeatedly, and prevent the malady from drinking, eat salty and alcoholic foods, and do not drink water, as it is necessary that this regimen be followed.
This is the form of the tool with which you take out when seen, and it seems like forceps used times upon times, but without any curve in them. The provided text is in Old Spanish or Medieval Latin-influenced language similar to the ones mentioned (Latin, Italian, and others). Here's a translation:

The text translates to English as: "Therefore various in piercing and section for their specific signs of madness (humoral imbalance), where one is due directly through abscesses themselves, from which we extract the moisture." Here a reference is made that gout or certain types of joint pain may present with 'abscess-like' manifestations requiring intervention. The term "perforacio" likely means piercing (as in surgical), and it seems to relate directly to obtaining fluid, possibly synovial fluid from an
The Latin text translates to English as follows: "Secondly, these locations are where acids cause abscesses elsewhere in the body (with some specifics occurr0149 for head and limbs); each type of accidental scalding is different from one another - with scalding at joint areas being distinctively separate from general acid burn. Each kind herein requires surgical intervention." This passage outlines several scenarios where acids cause abscesses, differing by location (head vs extremities), and concludes that each type of injury necessitating urgent medical attention involving possible surgeries to manage the conditions described. The mention of 'scalding' suggests a discussion on burns possibly related to humoral imbalance or other pathologies in this medieval context, which may include
When there are some apendices that have not been pierced but belong to the progression of illness in those areas, or their complement.
So other appliances that are thrown when they come together and do not mature according to their complement, similar to those applied at joints, which become a part of the body'0thin space as it moves within this fluid (the humors), damaging ligaments or nerves in that joint; if perforation occurs before full ripening here, injury will occur elsewhere towards the main member; and when dealing with appendices where maturity is lacking. If you pierce during immaturity at these places of originating pain within the body (the colon), it disrupts digestion instead – that which causes this localized inflammation or fistula, one not healing therein. May you know the hour of the puncture for the abscess, and so it is when it ripens.
You understand that when the cessation of pain and fever occurs, along with the reduction in speech and heartbeat, and the hardening of the head due to apendicitis, as well as other symptoms.
When you know where the puncture entry site is, near recent or incoming infection spots for drainage purposes of abscess and swelling treatment.
Perforation occurs through the length of the flesh or body part and in places where muscles, nerves, ligaments are located, as well as areas that do not reflect; use puncture according to which member it is being reflected upon in these reflexive spots.
When the abscess is in the flesh, then we must perform its incision inside until it has been confirmed that digestion of the patient' extruded matter secondly completed; and if you pierce through this at that time, both legs will become hardened by dullness and painfully thick lips as well as deepening within.
May you pierce through according to the direction of flesh or bone as needed, or according to what part of the body needs it.
When administering a small puncture, and for large or wide incisions according to the size of the apastmae, do as follows:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
From those who are seated and have three angles; they sit like the feathers of a pearl or with the shapes of joints' appendages:
From them in which it is administered—round and crescent-shaped doses—and seem like these to the patients:
May those who cannot be pierced with their surface-level spines (like lizards), have only a puncture made shallowly above the spot where it is possible to penetrate them.
When the abscess is large and has gathered pus already, do not attempt to extract it all at once from that hour; they take out part of it daily, return what was removed into another area today, remove a larger portion tomorrow, continuing in this way until extraction through fistula formation.
Mostly if the malady is caused by overcooling or a female prenatal phase, or in infancy or old age when vitality declines and animal spirits move towards exit from disease, they depart for outside forcefully leaving sickness behind them; you must intervene to treat it.
Guard with great care and place your instrument in the one through which you pierce these implants, making sure to avoid any impurities; consider if there is little or flat pus within it, then attend to him accordingly as directed by ancient remedies or contemporary treatments. If instead the abscess is large and cracks appear on the site of incision, cease all operations in each trauma where we may come into contact with you.
If in the abscess it has detached a part of the colon or if that area has been concave within its circuit, then cover it with fine cloth or linen as soon as you have applied pans or gauze; and keep this moist until the third day. Then process both treatments to cure what comes out during treatment (i.dict from the wound dressings).
If you experience bleeding during your operation, then administer cold water and wring them into the places where bandages are applied; pause there over the location of the blood flow that continues spontaneously.
If the flow of blood persists, then take care that you follow your regimen and medicines which I have recommended in these sections of our book and division.
If it is winter time and the site of abscessation is a place where nerves are located, then you wrap them in oil and vinegar for treatment, applying those over these locations.
If it is summer and the locations are fleshy, then cover them with water and oil or vinegar and wine as we have said before; thus you protect what enters into their body until they heal according to our discussion today.

The phrase "curacio di curazione dell'eminentia dell'umbilicus" in English can be translated as
The eminence of the umbilicus is pained by causes—either due to cracks in the navel that are on its surface (i.e., potentially related wounds or fissures), where leeches may lie if there have been other ruptures, or because blood vessels and arteries flushed from their place when it is contracted; also pain can occur due to constricted winds within the body as described hereinabove.
If there is a split in the cistern and of the skin layer, then the appearance of ulceration resembles that of the body' extraneous colors are like its own coloring, which can manifest as lemon-like pain; it varies depending on different situations. If it is for the escape of the intestine, you have noted where that which we possess has recounted to us with great forcefulness, and once observed; return now—and when this situation occurs again, immediately provide baths and vigorous treatment.

And when the operation on them is considered if the prominence of their navel is due to gallstone, vein or windiness; they fear and tremble as taught in the academy where I have previously explained about operations with cautery for stone and vein.
If the prominency of the navel is due to the intestine or membrane, then order that which holds it tightens its grip on said area and remains extended; command at this time for your staff (doctor) to attempt throughout the entire circumference of the navel where you have touched with a touch, placing themselves between the patient'sin hands. Also position yourself above their stomach in relation to these hand positions within the circle of the navel that was previously touched; and encircle this area using spinal cord (or midline), over which your staff must be standing or seated as appropriate for each case, ensuring they maintain proper posture. Additionally position a guardian figure (possibly an assistant) in their circuit around unction areas above the navel with bowels; and place control under said hands of that individual to prevent slippage during procedure application.

If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them into where it pierces and expands the flesh; once inserted, slide them in and take care that what is inside those linens goes down for cleansing purposes.

The given line from the medieval medical treatise in Latin, which seems to discuss issues related to surgery or wound healing (given terms like "prepuci," referring perhaps to a foreskin), can be translated into English as follows:
Movements worsen this illness in my joints and above all, it is swelling of fatty flesh.
From that one is evil (or harmful), and from others are not evil or harmliminal:
No malignantly (Not harmfully), where you suspend and separate the thin membrane under which that whole contains its moisture; place some over there submerged in Egyptian linseed oil, and another for healing within it while it is anointed.
If the gallbladdig is black in color and evil (malignant), then make it with pointed cautery for its liver and reason, respectively.
If the foreskin is present on the head of the penis (circumcision not performed), and one part of it has been cut off while another remains intact; as long as you hold that which was cut, until solidification occurs within; then attend to what remained uncut at that moment. And when curing this fracture on the prepuce, there is no certainty that it will not break again.
And examine the testicles and foreskin blackness and swelling; therefore ensure that you clean up all of what has already darkened and is at risk to become corrupted or rotten, and apply liniments made from crushed fresh rye bread flour and berries pounded and ground.
Return that healing care for what has been inside is necessary now.
May it be necessary for fluid from the sanction (blood), then administer moonlight cupping according to this method.
Quarly cauterius juvat duas dispositiones incensa, est motus sancti et pulli quo corruptum sumtur.
If the head of the gallbladthy is corroded and destroyed in an instant, then place a lead pipe into the abdomen's flesh to allow bile through it via that channel.
In the attachment of the prepuce at the base of the foreskin (and this adherence is not removed around circumcision; and when you have an adhesion due to dirt or scab) cover that hardened area within which the prepuice lies, dissolving its ligament completely and removing the cap of the foreskin entirely.
If it is difficult to desire those exquisitely, then cover your spine and penis with some substance for a cause from the head of the pubis and the foreskin; so that when you delicately perforate through its subtlety, there will be no harm.
When you separate the foreskin and head of hair (under it), which already has become entangled in humidity due to its proximity, thus preventing other urine from sticking as well.

In translating the given line into English, we get:
Circumcision is not a cure for diarrhea: however, when it comes from our operation and of our willfulness, or in children, we must assign them to the better treatment course with light medicines as necessary.
So they say that ancient times did not practice castration among free men, nor do so today for legal reasons and only out of experiment, which causes the majority of artisans and barbarians to abandon circumcision using new razors and knives; thusly utilizing steel pliers (ligament) and scalpels made from iron.
E you have already tried all these methods and found no better improvement with knife or thread in the mending of wounds, where bleeding comes from below (undernethy), beneath the scrotum when two tunics are worn together, and quickly rises to the surface (above genitals), leaving you vulnerable to other injuries and pain.

On the care of retained urine in the bladder.
Hold urine in the bladder is considered a disease due to excess humors caused by stones or kidney congestion, and seem similar to those mentioned for hand treatments during division of care.
If there is not enough water that we have to use forcefully as a tool for extraction, then take an instrument of silver or subtle lion capture (which has fine detail like the length of a pen and finger), with delicate wings similar in size to a palm and thumb. The handle of this device should be placed at the top of their head.

This line underscores the importance doctors placed upon choosing suitable catheters—perhaps
When acute inflammation or ulcer is present in the bladder, or when it becomes congested and obstructed by a prostate enlargement (benign prostatic hyperplasia), where urine flow is impeded, one must distill waters and medicines therein; thus they call for an instrument resembling catheterization to address this issue. Here the medical practice involves using tools similar in purpose or design to natural processes like water filtration combined with remedies derived from those same elements—a treatment method that symbolizes a fusion of healing practices and practical application aiming at restoring normal urinary function while respecting traditional medicinal principles where intervention mimics the cleansing power associated with rainwater. This passage illustrates an approach in medieval medicine
sino que in the outer part of it is silent, so it is closed. And in that way three troubles arise from one division, twice a time.

We have here divided the stones and their curative properties for medicine purposes; distinguishing between those formed in rivers (fluvial) and those from urine bladder storage areas (vesicular), as well as understanding these differences concerning health benefits or medicinal uses of each type. This suggests an early comprehension by physicians that different environmental conditions, such as where a stone forms—whether it is carried downstream in water bodies like rivers ("fluvial") and deposited thereafter with sedimentary processes; or formed within the bladder due to mineral-rich urine (vesicular), have unique characteristics. These distin0

And this is what he presents as clear evidence and a concise exposition – suggesting that the author believes their description or study of urinary stones ('uric calculi') offers definitive proof
Therefore he states that the stone formed in the bladder mainly occurs in children ('infant'; 'lu' indicating his observation or knowledge); and from what exits of urine (the stream) looks like water upon its subtlety, appearing within those sands; hereupon it is dressed up for use – akin to making preparations with these stones found near the place where children expel them. This implies an understanding that such bladder-formed stones are common in pediatric patients ('enfantz'), and they might be collected or used after being washed (or 'dressed') by some method, possibly for medicinal reasons – with water playing a role as both the source of these formations inside urine storage areas like bladders ("vesica") and potentially also in their cleaning process before use. The term "malaute fregua la sua vergua" could mean that malevolent entities ('maleficiens') are chastised by water, while 'motas veguadas pen' suggests a cleansing or purifying act performed on the stone
And it is when health recovery of those children within that have reached twelve years, and cure in the womb becomes difficult. May in young people move through these liquids herein flowing.

Return into its proper place is what this body part takes after being descended within it: e splits in the abdomen between the belly and intestines (not at their location here), above the left hip bone; and its section is over that stone and does so as a transverse cut, ensuring that the section becomes wide and stitched according to how much of the stone's size there in the abdomen can be allowed without exceeding it. This may mean surgery will not take place due to lack of space or if they cannot remove what is already inside (presumably a blockage within the intestines).
E understand that there is any stone from which the patient' extrusion originates; it makes treatment difficult by water (presumably an excess of body fluids).
From that fluid is likened to lion'thyng and it roundish; made of the body's humors for medicine extraction.
So if it is that which you have turned or spread apart (especially referring back to joint pain mentioned earlier), adjust in the crack/gap.

If you cannot do so over that one (referring to the aforementioned condition), then increase slightly the disruption of it and if you see fluid outflows around it, break apart those flows with concentrated sulfur dissolved in vinegar.
May the stone be one of them (indicating that there is only one small stone present), then you will draw it to the mouth of the bladder and place your hand over it here; also, lead a little bit more of water towards it; as if they were mere drops of urine.
If there is much pain, it is ignorance that you have immersed the large section in, which causes harm to the bladder for one of two reasons: either because something stays within or continues to ascend from urine distillation, and thus the location is not fully consolidated.
May you administer the removal of it from within that has come out or in the case of a bone breakage inside where those instruments are placed to extract it, so they can be taken out through wounds.

If the stone is small and located in the bladder, where it lies within you, then urine extraction is prohibited; as a result of this treatment, patients who are said to have passed stones often complain that they continue passing them. At this point, you already extracted the fluid (urine), and now hold on tightly with one hand using a hollow iron tool (catheter). This instrument represents its form:
From outside the womb, gout is in a pipe (or tube).
Return your faith promptly and place it in that stone for as long as possible until it does not return to the bladder again.
And insert the iron into the wound quickly so that the puncture tool enters at that point. Here you gradually insert the probe in your hand into that small stone, and as long as one from another part is entering it, then the urine flows out immediately.

Not necessarily is the need for an iron screw immediately after carving it into stone (the bone), but rather to prevent its return back in urine; and another ligament above does not come until when you remove that specific metal from around the bone, then this tendon returns to place and reclaims earth/ground. The passage discusses treatment methods for a fractured or dislocated limb where surgical intervention might be needed (carving of an iron screw into stone), suggesting instead some form of at-home care that involves stabilization without immediate invasive procedures, using physical means to manage the condition until proper medical attention can take place. The concept implies a balance between immobilizing and allowing natural healing
When you lift the iron screw above (away from), which elevates or supports the tendon in its regions thereafter; if necessary when taking it away—do so with care and completension, returning to earth/ground as we have discussed herewith together.

Then apply that present to him and command him to compress all the humors you have sent, from inquiry about the stone in his anus until consumption at his navel; this causes concern if the woman is vaginal and wants what's inside of her down into her belly.

This excerpt describes a hernia as an accumulation of moisture in the scrotum where semen (represented here by "humiditat") is contained within the testicles ("codena dels genetius"). The term 'cipa' seems to refer specifically to this area, hence it being called simply 'the cipa.' Here we understand a hernia in medieval medical thought as an issue related to fluid retention and its effects on male reproductive organs
Some believe it occurs in the peritoneum where nature intervenes when there is already semen present (as mentioned earlier); and this area between the scrotal skin ('cipac blanc') contains what we've described as 'the cipa,' which they assert isn't simply moisture but something else, likely a solid or semi-solid substance. This line from medieval medical texts contemplates differing theories about hernias—specifically the notion that not just fluid is retained in this space between male genitalia and scrotal skin; instead of being merely wet matter (humor), it could be another form, possibly related to pathological solidification within a man
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: The generation of this hernia is through debilitation which you cause in these areas (hips), causing them to become weakened, and some will be channeled outwards due to impact or striking upon these regions.
This moisture has movements of colors; whether it is turning to lemon yellow or scarlet like blood, black dungy clay, or white foam—this too I speak about now.
When the joints for which this addition of water is needed are these: if it's in the clear white place we mentioned earlier (likely referring to a specific body area), then rheumatism starts receding during prolonged sitting with its shape resembling urine, and blood appears.
If there is moisture in the patient' extranodular region (referring to an area outside of their body), then let it be removed and as such, he/she considers this other humerus or limb unnecessary for his bodily composition.
If the moisture is between the navel and the white line of the bellybutton (which may refer to a specific anatomical area), then apply pressure with your fingers on that spot.
When you wish to ascertain the color of humidity, look for the moisture that has entered and preceded its form; then observe what comes out in its appearance within the wound entrance.

The arrival of this hernia occurs due to a process by which the cords (budels) extend over the stomach's interior surface as described in its abdomen, so that when these cord extensions come from their breaks or ruptures nearer them. This sentence is articulating how certain anatomical changes might lead up to hernia symptoms and diagnosis according medieval medical understanding—specifically referencing the 'cords' of internal structures possibly referring to intestines, expanding over a weakened area in the abdominal wall ('stomachs interior surface'), suggesting a vulner
This rupture occurs either in the cord or due to exhalation of it; these fragrances worsen them for various reasons: through blowing (percussio), coughing (sputum expulsion - perhaps not precisely termed 'sautz' here, but possibly implying a forceful respiratory action like sneezing or violent coughing as means to release pressure and relieve symptoms of distension in the body): either by blowing out air sharply (percussio), through spitting up phlegm during coughs ('sautz'), loud noise inducing strain, elevation from any severe cause such as being lifted improper
The term 'aqueous' (water-like) when the cord is stretched out due to extension causes it only mildly or not at all over long periods, and does not worsen its condition; moreover, within a brief timeframe (not specified but implied), one may find relief by placing pressure inside these areas nearer where the cords are located. Herein lies an approach consistent with medieval medical theories—where external manipulation of body parts like applying compressions or positioning could alleviate certain conditions such as hernias, reflective of early understandings before modern surgical techniques were established to treat abdominal protrusions (herniation

The treatment for the scrotum (referring to male reproductive organs). In English: The remedy for inflammation or pain
The scrotum in healthy men is softened by applying poultices made from the fats that are between it; and they take care of its observation. In English: The condition of a man's scrotum improves when gentle applications, such as ointments or creams derived from natural fatty substances found within (between) them, are used along with close monitoring for any changes in the area.
Therefore it is necessary that one attends (to the care) of him who makes urine about his swolthy, and places all over the scrotum which has been softened on its natural counterpart; and ensure to align lips with stitches for proper closure. In English: It's important to pay attention when someone produces excessive sweating associated with an enlarged or 'swolty' testicle (possibly referring to a hydrocele, where fluid accumulates around the testicles causing them to swell). The treatment involves applying softened fats from within over their natural position and using sutures if necessary for closure.

May it be that in the patient there is an inserted artery and a flow of blood has been achieved; if so, separate or dry out that one, or perform cautery on it if necessary to induce diuresis (the removal of excess water from the body).
May you have inspected the vertebrae of the gout or all, and thus saved the veins in the collarbone; once done so, adjust your lips to be sutured over the spine' extrusion site without touching it there itself; after aligning them with their natural form shape using stitches, apply firm pressure on that area for a few days until healing occurs. Also provide care and attention in those places where fixation has been done so they may recover properly.
May if the child already has pain in their bones, then you will strike that area; and if there are fragments of bone inside them, remove all those pieces which you can from them; but if it is not within your power to enter, allow water for the child to absorb so they self-repair, and be separated out and taken away.
If the child is freshly born today, then sprinkle dust on that which was recommended for you. If in the patient there is a leak (fistula), then cure that part with water to which memory will return for healing purposes at their head.
If it is percussion of the lancet or cottle, and at times you reach depth, consider perhaps if the air infiltrates when blood comes out from beneath due to pleurisy (lung inflammation); know that the pus (pus) itself can be life-thseeking.
If there is no depth and the fluid has recently come to its sanction within him, then you pause in his chest for the first hour after sunrthy coverings begin (likely referring to morning), without stretching that which prevents it from being retained deep within him and returning to the heart; perhaps a lubricating ointment applied can assist with these movements, allowing them until later today.
If the ointment is not at your disposal, then rest in the chamber of mud and water to draw out moisture that comes from the humidities; let the gout sleep on the mud so as the body' extricated fluid can flow through it properly.
May you have passed through the swamp for three days or more and did not experience spasm, illness of the chest nor constriction of breath, now use whatever other good measures are available to you; then take care of that cure and also attend to any further healing until recovery.
May it be that the healing of him is allowed, and even now he has been bound tightly, so prudently advise you that already there is a fistula formed; therefore attend to this matter with your knowledge as chief physician.
If the pain is due to a fissure in space or cavity and it'thy simple on the surface of the skin or back, then cure that which has come after stitching if large, or powder if small.
If there is pain in the bone and if those intra-articular stones have already been separated (i.dict), then apply force to remove them using a lever/tool from that joint. If they are not separated, let them be placed inside that the vermin may escape out of their reach.
From other accidents affecting the other limbs, health is maintained by what we have said here today.
From "the illnesses of the stomach.
The discomdictio which you have in your stomach is great, little, or migrating.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And so the best interruption will occur there, for in that place it is difficult to reduce the hernia, just as with the diseases of these organs mentioned hereinabove.
Even knowing that stitching of the abdomen is performed with four kinds of threads, it may be necessary to use common stitches for other diseases on the body as well.
When two other stitches communicate with each other (and possibly also with the ones on their abdomen), it is as they are within or near that particular seam of the belly.
When each person is exposed or declared (recommended/advised), here it goes for you now in English, line by line translation of this medieval medical treatise text would be as
So say that when the swelling is small and there' extrinsic cause of hernia in it (external factor), then healing becomes difficult; either because due to disruption with breathing as we have done, or if the balloon-like expansion caused by cold air. Here 'petita' refers to a minor issue that can be resolved simply through appropriate measures such as those mentioned ("disruption during respiration" and "expansion from exposure to cold"). The overall context of this medieval text suggests medical advice on handling hernias, possibly relating to treatment methods considering environmental factors like breathing or temperature.
So when the humidity is present (implying a moist or wet environment), take care that you scrape away what submerges in water alone – suggesting some form of treatment involving direct application to affected areas, perhaps soaked cloth with healing herbs like comfrey and arnica applied directly. Here 'ayssi' refers to the conditions (humidity) when action is taken; ‘aquo’ translates as wet or humid air around you – a factor affecting treatment choice which could involve moistening of remedies ('sponga ho drap') with healing plants like comfrey, arnica and possibly rosemary. In medieval times without advanced medical knowledge, this text implies practical home-based treatments using natural elements combined in specific ways to manage conditions such as inflammation caused by cold or humidity – a practice not uncommon for the period before modern medicine developed
And when some measures have been taken in which the secretion has stopped, it is better than water alone for the resolution of inflammation.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine in the place where it has been elevated and swolgy with water; this allows for its gentle return to the body due to a slight cause.
May it be that the interior is released from this treatment, and then you will divide the rupture into small parts with an instrument for which they have been inserted injections.
The initial text translation into English would be as follows:
Of the tool, its form is as follows:
One sharp blow of the axe (or tool), and the other not sharp, along with a subtle touch that is not like bone fragility—this edge becomes blunt quickly.
And when the vermin is increased and comes out of the intestine, it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible on top of it, which would be better.
When the disruption is extensive and occurs in the lower abdomen, then you make the hernia protrude into your patient's thighs, and place cushions under their legs; if it is located above the stomach, put a cap on the head of the person and lay pillows atop.

And ensure that it is not extended with suture so that recovery (consolidation) is not hindered.
Here is the translation line by line:
These surgical needles are placed carefully in the small wounds; it is enough for their stitching either one of these or that which surrounds them therein.
May the second stitch be common: and it is that you insert needles into the four extremities (hands/feet), from the chest downwards, using a fine-pointed needle with both delicacy and thickness.
When the needle of that surgeon'thy hand has penetrated these four extremities, reduce it from where you are handling it to make sure the wound cloth fold goes up into its own cavity below part split by your hands cuts and thus ensuring sutures tightly bound as with layers of cloth.
When there is a pause between any stitch of the body'dictum (likely referring to surgery or an incision), it concerns the amount of the bulk, that part of the body being referred to in this
When there is a pause between any stitch ("sutura") of the body's fabric (implied met
When there is a pause in the suturing of this body, it concerns how much bulk (the size or swelling), which was previously inflicted upon an individual within whose stomach stones were lodged causing significant internal disruption; these obstructions had been present for forty-eight hours. As such interventions are required to relieve pressure and address the issue at hand, you must reduce that portion of the body (the affected area) wherein the gallstones have become encysted within it due to prolonged obstruction in their native bile duct ("mieg loc"). The term "reductiu" here implies a medical procedure aiming for decompression or removal.
The following is the line by line translation of the medieval medical treatise:

Thus healed, you shall not need other medicines when simple diseases occur.
If you fear that the vermin may communicate in injury to the principal members of the body, then submerge wool in cold-pressed oil or vinegar and apply it within the spaces between joints where bones meet each other; also place some on the legs' surfaces and others undernethy.

These give proximity to the main limb and its likenesses.
So this is what the sentence translates to: And that which of these fistulas according to this illness are diseases difficult to cure and do not receive care; it engages work for itself, occupation due to lack of knowledge.
If there is any depth to the wound that does not reach these places mentioned herein, and you wait for its healing while believing in it yourself, then attempt with iron or arsenic (as remedies), if the fistula closes afterward, seek out whoever treated him.

Herein lies knowledge on how one might treat fractures according to medieval medical practice:
May those who restore the fracture of another limb postponed when not restored to the table for repair according as it bends, and is repaified according to its twistiness; this is error in their work, great fear—if they were straightening arightly, then these Ancients would expand freely without restraint from water.
Yet they have not seen any doctor for it, so it's reasonable that there has been nothing done about it.
Capitol second: When you break a bone in the head.
Las spices of fractures are movements, and their forms are various, and the causes are distinctly different: for one type of fracture is caused by impact on a space (percussion), which enters into both bones, as if it were entering through the mouth to reach the chest; hence this particular spice is named. Or when an indentation incises some part of the body and incises the flesh without passing inside below that place: herein lies another type of fracture called lifting absolute.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
This fracture or invasion has already reached the periosteum of the bone where it lodges now; or is within the face of the bone and its dust (i.dict humors).
And when it is about a bone fracture, it occurs in the subtlety of the hair strand small and for this reason we call this particular kind of fine-line fracture.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Mostly it hurts in the bones of our joints when they are covered with phlegm (or effusion), as such:
So for all these hard-set fractures, they are set apart with splints as if separate stones. When all this fluid returns to its place, in that location.
With all these spices for detection regarding those and to investigate their attempts at restoring corrupt flesh upon them,
A special vein is discovered through observation of the bone and it's withheld here on this body until there appears a black fracture breakage.
When treating fractures consider the accidents of humour imbalance, and when these signs indicate distress as if vomiting from cholera, or extension, loss of understanding, abscesses, syncopes, acute fever, medication and requests of those affected, all such do not lead to healing.
If an accident occurs due to improper flow (of humors), then you begin treatment for it.
The cause is that the plague comes into your meal together with it and water in the days of winter, hence you should study its location on the bone during the twelfthy day entirely.
If it is in the summer days, when you press your cheeks with your hands throughout the day, they become rotten due to the pancreas (the organ mentioned here could be associated with digestive functions), and this causes accidents that have been recommended for us.
If the fracture has reached the brain covering (panniculus cerebri), and it is composed of small bones and cartilage, then cut out what was broken and put together again as recommended for you.
When you raise the head of the patient suffering from inflammation, and examine over their shoulder bones according to what is customary in your practice for such illnesses, making them lie on their back with respect to the hips.
If you have to detect the bone and apply sanction or pus cauterization now, then hold back what fluid is flowing from it in water and oil infusion until the purulent matter rests; this will ensure that there are no more discharges of pus. Start at the location of the affected limb and incision.

Not so it is called absence of urine but these are the ones that stop the flow in the bone'se edge where the upper part meets the lower end, a rounded extreme or margin on this place seems like an inner circle small enough to prevent submersion and passage through the bone.

If the bone fracture does not penetrate into the periosteum, and what is left of the bone becomes its face, with roughness and subtleties present therein, take care that you remove those roughnesses and eliminate those subtleties using tools prepared according to their various sizes so as to be able at all times within this place administer medications or treatments suitable for each patient's location precisely where they are needed.

When the nose fractures, or breaks. (This translation interprets "trincar" as a verb related to breaking
Know that the nose is not broken but fractured into pieces which were placed sideways; these two bones form what was formerly part of the nasal cartilage, and it causes twisting (deformation) and subsidence without actual breaking or crushing injury to be done. This sentence describes a situation where someone may mistakenly believe their nose is completely broken when in fact only parts have been displaced sideways—likely due to trauma that affected the nasal structure but did not result in full breakage of the bone itself, as indicated by terms such as "cartilaginosa" (related to cartilage) and specific symptoms like twisting ("tortuositat") or sinking below normal positioning ("sinuitat").
May it break one of the limbs' parts, then place a small object in your nose and encircle that fracture with said item between your nostrdict (nose), keeping it there until you return their nose to its natural shape. And if it is needed for your ease, and that you do not harm the groin of yours through this operation on them,

If the jawbone is separated into two parts, then you must administer extension of those pieces until it's possible for them to come together again.
If consciousness is disturbed and you hope that they will come out of the mouth or silver/gold nail made with precious metal, pause over the broken jawbone cratered in place, as well as on both layers of the cloth doublet, including a linen gauze thread stretching along the length of the mandibula; and apply that underlayer where it fits into your garment's lining. Do this until not destroyed by you (the patient).
And command the humors (body fluids) that they rest and calmness, stopping food from being absorbed by the liver bile stones.
If you find that the figure has been altered in some way, then take care of it and remove whatever is causing this change today; rectify what already exists from its location here and place there among powders such as chalk or albumen (egg white), flour made from rice, which will provide relief for your body.
And when that bandage is placed and adjusted on him, and the position of his bones remains unaltered, so he who does not enter it will recover fully strengthened from this fracture; such breaks are mended in three simple stages.
If another flogging occurs as an abscess treatment, then apply what we have mentioned before for these previous treatments within the patient' extraneous membrane until it is healed and that ulceration removed.
If the fracture is of bone, consider whether it has been separated or dislocated; then remove those displacements with whatever tool you find suitable for drawing them back to where they belong in the body'dictory positioning during recovery.
If the poultice of the patient is dry, then increase it with more lint according to your need.
When you have removed those stones and are no longer suffering from them remnants, if there is still space left in the belly for treatment with purgatives (if needed), apply it to that part which was previously designated; thus healing will occur as desired.

When the wing is broken, it's time for medical intervention (likely suggesting a fracture in need of restoration). Translating this line into English
Carefully examined is the broken wing of the player and that fracture has been classified into one of three grades or types. Here's a possible translation:
When it is broken, separated or divided into parts not adjacent to splinters; and for its repair in such cases, lubrication may be applied within the fragments (which indicates a non-aligned break), making restoration difficult if at all possible—or when fractured as with children.
When the operation in that case occurs because of a broken clavicle, it is to make sure there are two ministers present: one holds the attendant' extricated arm (tengua), and the other extends the collapsed chest where it was injured (furcula trencada).
Return the bone as it is within that where its form according to what covers it should be, and let there not be little elevation or indentation in it.
If indigestion extends, then stop the thrust of your malady'setup with a cloth or woolen pad as needed; and raise and contract the shoulder blade according to what you need in order to unblock it within yourself through clutching (holding tightly).

Here comes the first source sentence to translate: E the minister presses on the muscle of him at the joints until the bone of the shoulder blade is elevated above his shoulders, and then he corrects the fracture and applies it with those bands.
If you feel sharp pains in the shoulder and neck area, it is advisable that a blade be applied to that spot and removed from there easily.
If it is retained in the bone, then you will make an incision of yours on one of those instruments which have been prepared for this purpose, and place a pause quickly at the shoulder joint' extricator; its form consists of either wood or iron.

If the disruption of the bone you have inserted when extracting the splint is wide and there are signs of an abscess present, then tighten the wound edges with stitches on the broken bone.
If the displacement is slight or there'sinfection that requires treatment with caution, then apply poultices and powders according to the quantity of the wound gap.

If the stone is concave in some parts of the scalpel, then you grip that indentation with your thumb and index finger to press it down like a lion' extrusion (suggesting firm pressure), and adjust the blade accordingly for balance/equilibrium.
Return strength from below upward, away from the spinal column's compression and herniated disc within so that it is not worsened by its location.
Consider the ligament each day; and every time it is softened, apply another application of oil to strengthen its joints if they have become swoln in their place.

And when this number is completed, you will then break down the ligaments (ligamento), and understand that they are secure from those bones with which I started not to fear their destruction or breaking apart. This implies a healing process where after certain exergy-restoring actions have been taken—like applying pressure through an instrument over several days as mentioned earlier, followed by addressing the ligaments without risk of damage (as they are deemed secure), ensuring that rehabilitation proceeds in safety and effectiveness.
If you proceed to the location of the bone and apply pressure with pads (padding), then stop and hold it there, as we have said regarding the healing fracture in the humerus joint socket affected by immobilization therapy if necessary here—indicating a specific procedure for treating such an injury. The emphasis is on applying gentle but firm pressure with padding to aid in bone realignment and stabilization, followed potentially by additional measures like casts or splints as needed ("if accideys," suggesting immobilization might be considered). This would typically occur during the manual manipulation phase of treatment for a fractured humerus socket.

The restoration of him is that his spleen be placed above the two legs and a cushion between the shoulders; properly tend to the muscles, adjusting the back so as not to exceed two curves, being subtle in both operation and dance according to all possible art known at this time which suits well with returning the figure of bone.
Here comes the translation: Apply pressure with bandage and tape on this area, cover it with cloth as you do so. Understand that if there is a fracture without displacement here, secure thin sticks or splints of bone/wood beneath these parts (legs), binding them together; after feeling the spasms subside for some time, tighten further on this tendon to properly align it with its joint. Continuously assess how well-bound that ligament is at all times and when softened by pressure, continue applying tension therewithly.
If it is necessary to provoke the dismemberment of that which corrupts or pricks therein, causing pain in the locale, then you must break and remove the impurity (implant), correcting what causes such suffering by managing its nature; if sometimes directed towards the face, adjust the constriction within so it may heal.

When the coast fractures, it does not occur in large spaces which are between them but rather near their joints; and from there, we understand that these dislocations do not directly affect those parts to be thrown into adjacent cavities due to such cleftnesses but because of water channels so cartilaginous. Upon learning of his mind not being afflicted by its own inquiry, I understand that he has insight into himself now.
The restoration is to be done as best possible according to the patient' extrication manner and timing; immobilize and bandage the broken bone at the site if required by that person.
If the fracture of the backbone is declining into parts, it causes severe pain and piercing sensations, similar when you cry, and due to this cause your bones become weakened (as if held by a woolen garment); difficulty in breathing occurs along with coughs, fevers, nausea, vomiting of motion; these are conditions that require difficult treatment.

When feeling painful sensations therein, know that it is unlikely to be cured at this stage of application. In matters concerning dispositions leading towards death, caution must prevail.
If the humors are moved in those and cause pain therein with piercing or constriction, then you will know that bone of the body is saved and maladies guarded by blood for cure.

If you have fractured the bone or any cause that has already separated from it, then press on the spine and touch the bone itself; if there is a large wound, suture with thread (surgical stitches), and take care of its covered parts until healed.
May your bone ends break (fracture), and the fissure of blood is what you insert into the left side's hollow in the belly; doing so close to where it broke on the other flank as possible with a lance, applying pressure above this wound site if needed for bleeding control. Also apply firm touch over dressed (bandaged) and armor areas that have been touched by these instruments; similarly tighten your grip therein accordingly when handling them.
If you feel broken pieces in it (the body), then touch that area and hold it steady, and heal the child as follows: follow what has been done before for recovery until they are cured.

The restoration of him/her is that you stretch your hand over where there'thy body part lies, which forms the figure of them (the patient).
If the break is in just one of your limbs, then you should apply that which has been applied to it by means of an arm bandage until it forms back to its normal shape naturally.
If the fracture is long or already descending into parts, then you shall speak to the malady within your belly as it becomes prepared for the restoration of that fracture. And when you have applied the plaster to that area, pause over it with a splint made of wood or bone, and press firmly on the point where there is no fear of a fracture puncture nor removal of the spine.
When the cavity is filled with water that occupies it equally as far as the constriction allows, and commands the hump to lie on its back or over its chest side,

The provided text appears as an excerpt from medieval medical writings
Regarding the treatment of a hip bone fracture (presuming "os" refers to the hipbone and "coyssa" corresponds with thigh or gro
The hip bone (os coyssa) has been displaced and is declared to belong to the foreign body when it enters suddenly, thus suggesting that immediate surgical intervention may be required for its realignment or removal. In modern medical terms: The dislocated femur (hipbone) requires urgent orthopedic attention as a potential case of fracture-displacement due to trauma/sudden force applied externally leading
The treatment is performed as follows: One suture threaded through the fracture site and another immediately adjacent to it (proximally), both tightened around the hipbone, with a bandage applied over abdomen and face for support post-repair/immobilization. This description indicates that external fixation methods may have been used historically before contemporary internal stabilizing techniques were developed; sutures would be tied to secure fractured bone fragments in place while surrounding dressings provide additional stability during healing.
The doctor then extends the suture to its corresponding position on the bone fragment as soon as they reach it within the hipbone's socket (os), ensuring proper alignment and immobilization for healing during external fixation treatment methods used historically in such cases without modern internal hardware.
If external manipulation is needed for the thigh (cueyssa), then one suture threaded to its corresponding position on the femur fragment should be tightened around both leg segments and hipbone simultaneously with another immediately adjacent, thus ensuring that when extension occurs at these points of fixation in line with each other across all three structures—the cueyssa (thigh), calcanheira or patella if mentioned earlier, and the femur itself. This procedure indicates a manual technique for external splinting using sutures to maintain limb alignment while awaiting further treatment options like casting or internal fixation after assessment of

It appears that the text you've provided is a medical description in medieval Latin or an early form of Spanish with some similarities to these languages. Here is my attempt at translating your line into English:
When you apply warmth to the joint of two bones in the arm, and by this application there is restoration as well for both arms together, then that which acts upon it is considered an operation itself.
If two bones are joined together, then the cushion becomes all parts of them.
If the bone is trembling under pressure, then the cushion becomes parts of Dent's area.
If your bone is fractured thickly and quickly, then reduce that piece immediately; these are the causes beyond your control.
Accordingly administer stretching and limping exerthyze of the joints as per that direction.
Mayhaps if the bone of the thigh is broken and has splinters inside it, make the extension swell up and apply pressure with your will to aid healing.
In the cushion there is a cause for operation on the arms, and when you insert nails into it and perform the entirety of the operation, then take hickory shafts that have been paused just in time before causes previously stalled outdoors (i.e., due to weather or other reasons), which are used as tools with white palm leaves for this task; apply them only to those places where there is a small growth, and do not use hands unless necessary, the length of these according to the cushion's size, all within it until just before entering.
Envelop a cloth over each garment according to the length of it, and pause one on the division between the thigh cushions (one under another), and the other around their chest within the pus located at the base of the foot.
Return the limbs' pins to three locations of pain and at nighttime, where this positioning is forbidden for either left or right side movement, which serves as good support.
And a bolt of wood is administered according to the length of the cushion, and it's placed under the cushion in order that this one retain its motion.

Regarding the break of the calcaneus (heel bone) and the bones of the foot, including metatarsals/phalanges:
Although the toe does not suffer complete fracture; some bones of the foot may experience breaks and do not break in their positions but rather exhibit sprains within joints' arrangement.
If the bones of the foot have been broken and sometimes those very same bones are raised above each other on prepared earth as a result, then ensure that the humors (or fluids) do not rise within the foot' extruding pain or swelling.
And place your hand over the part where it is lifted from those bones, and apply some lime to them so that they are pressed back into their respective places until returned.
Return and apply pressure downward (and upward), applying an enema to the patient's abdomen using a small basin with two lids attached, holding their hands.
And strength that is in the arm must be stretched outwards, so you have wrapped it up and addressed other possible reasons for which a patient might seek help.
When three or four days have passed, then you should loosen the bandage, as it is necessary to crush and reset broken bones or joint dislocations, at which point these operations become concurrent with carrying loads (as in "coneysses").

The ligament will be turned over onto this dressing and attached firmly to the patient's chest, secured in place without noise for several days; ensuring that it remains quiet during these seven days.
When food of the malady is little paused (consumed), and then enters into rest (digestion), it leads to healing for that person.
Return (or restore) the food given is moderately or sufficiently increased and exergy engaged in motion; thus if it remains closed and does not soften, then healing will occur.
May it be if the joint is dislocated due to humidity that you induce in him or for another reason, then administer three kinds of treatments as described in the manual on cauterization.
If all this pain is present and the ligament and joint are not fixed for seven days, then after some time both the bandage and strain will be reduced on it, and that arm which cannot rise to its respective parts, you know well that the nerves of your limb (which run through or extend within/towards the muscle), either inscribed internally or softened externally with ointment, have never remained fixed in their place.
From the dislocation of that which is painful in the hips and breastbones or parts behind, reduction is by force and extension until return (meaning the joints are put back into place).
In that other constriction, it is given care until healed.
If you worsen the fever in the limb and slow down its movement, then make sure that such gravity is relieved until it returns to its original state of nature.

Regarding the treatment of hip dislocation:
You understand that the hip joint is dislocated with difficulty and appearance; it's dislocated in all parts, mainly at the part leading backward from there, and when you adjust the dislocated hip as needed (touch or manipulation according to whatever form it has been dislocated), then this becomes manifestly evident: now its concave joint is apparent, which means that your arm cannot bend here nor touch this very muscle.

When the restoration of him is possible, it means that his chest should be expanded and arms extended, and the doctor's hands are over the hips or thighs (and possibly on their back), pressing at the joint between their hands to return them to place.

If sprain does not submit to reduction, then apply vigorous extension and motion forcefully.
It is that two servants stretch their arms outward and hold them thusly to prevent excessive extension from occurring.
Return its arm completely turned over, placing it fully under the patient's chest with cloth or sinews (ligaments).

Some of the joints in your body are displaced (refers to a dislocation), and realignment is more laborious at these junctures than others; yet if immediate reduction occurs upon displacement, indicating an open or fresh fracture with periosteal reaction ('aposemat'), such cases can be managed effectively. This translation acknowledges the complexity of treating joint injuries where quick response times are crucial and complications like a specific type of bone injury needing different treatment considerations (Here, 'malassen' seems to signify displaced or misaligned parts).
The reduction of the dislocation is that you hold the thigh'marrow above a table and extend it from there; then let your doctor or hand rest on the imminent joint area, and push it back to its place.
Even if it is considered that the palm rests on the belly of him/her, then inflate and reduce his/her thighs over a table; and if dislocation has preceded, place her position so that her abdomen lies beneath this object inherently upon which meticulous care can be provided for impending joint connection.
And if it returns shortly afterward, all is well; but if not, that part becomes sore and begins to loosen its attachment, and you may not intervene until the days have passed.
Mightily the joint according to its curvature; and there is not a cause in Maelwuth but that it becomes softened, and cannot strenghten itself anymore—knowing that the nerves are twisted or spasmed, and you will strengthen them with purposeful cauterization at this place, providing some water to confer.
So when discomfort returns and we apply the one recommended by us to it (the ointment/remedy), let your rest on top of this, for days; furthermore, cut off its excessive part as well while exercising is done with you every day.
May it happen that the patient' extrinsic movement ceases and there is a decrease in their body weight or moisture; then you should provide them with water (aygua cauda) and cold measures (fregas), until they are relieved.
Given that this text is similar in structure to Latin with elements of Italian,
About the treatment for displacement." (Here 'curacio' could be translated as "treatment", and 'dislo
Some movements may have caused the joints to become misaligned throughout the body. ("Dislocation" refers to an injury where two parts of the bones in a joint are no longer aligned properly.)
When a joint of one hand or abdomen is dislocated (meaning the bones have been forced out of their normal position), apply pressure to realign it and gently manipulate back into place until return ("dislocatio" means "dislocation," with applied actions for correction).("Pouses tieus") might refer metap each time they are moved or returned.
Support the head of the limb and suspend that portion where it was dislocated; leave them supported for two days ("dislocacio" refers to "repositioning after injury," with an instructional action on care).("Deves la part a la qual es dislocat") translates as “that part which has been dislocated.” This suggests rest and immobil
Support that portion and extend it while still keeping the limb elevated for as long as today ("engualha" refers to immobilization or holding in place, with an instruction on continued care). This guidance implies maintaining a position of restorative support without movement until recovery.
When night approaches (when it gets dark), take that portion and alternate between resting during the day ("nocte") as described earlier in this narrative, and engaging with movement at night; do so for days until fully healed ('streit'). This sentence suggests a treatment plan involving alternating periods of immobility followed by gentle exercise (movement therapy), applied over several days leading to recovery. The term "alcus dias" can be translated as “healing days,” referring not just the passage of time but an expected healing process guided through periodic activities and rest, tailored for a patient with joint

When it seems like fluid is coming out at other body parts as well.
Given that "Capitol" doesn'se seem related directly
The provided Latin-like text seems to be discussing a medical condition, likely concerning the vertebrae of the thoracic (or possibly lumbar) region:
When one or more of the thoracic (or possibly lumbar) vertebrae becomes dislocated completely and subsequently move out of place there is not immediate treatment; until then death comes from shock to the internal organs, often referred to as 'the bowels'.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Thus it is swolthy at the back and there's no lubrication.
May the cure for them be that you also contemplate if the green sickness of youth is not a cure or healing for all of it.
May enter through cauterization or palpation to these areas, they have learned the ways of treatment in detailed speech; may return from there and open up where necessary according to their proximity for better understanding—this is what I speak about today, having used various tools available at that time to show them how.
From those it is not healed but that which you apply directly in their two places, as recommended by water;

The minister holds the staff and it is not fixed in a hole; another minister holds the other in that form.
Envelop the bandage over the head of the malady and tightly bind it with strong threads, extending up to where you need on the top part that covers the patient's head; secure this in place for the patient' extraterrestrial body parts (limbs), securing cushions under their legs as needed. Tighten all bandages firmly and tie them together at another barrel-like structure, which you need to support the weight of these alien bodies ("pes").
Here comes the translation: And have you stretched out your minister (physician) to reach the part of the beam where they are working on it, but do not make them overly tight as we previously mentioned.
The doctor pauses their hands on the spine for strength to return it into place and adjusts their weight within that space as well; this is done while maintaining contact with one hand over the spine, which provides support back in its cavity using another body part or cushion.
If it does not return by this method, take a table of which the length or width is three feet, and dig into the place where we have previously mentioned that there should be an opening for the malady in between (the legs), at the location corresponding to the extremity of the table. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you wish to turn the quality that has been revolved around your head; and it is necessary for you to keep the top of your waist on the ground at the back end of two sticks, which are each as long as one arm, and place the top of your head between them so they form a triangle with a palm-length space in between; now that quality has already been found within any stick where it is moving upwards (as if ascending), and at some point on land it rests firmly to prevent being gouty.
And take a staff in which you twist it between the two sticks of each pair.
In the limb there is a disruption where it forms wood of such length that its width equals water turned over; and in the two other pieces, they seem like that one.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And for each turn and position of the thighs you must appoint someone to hold it in place, and have a doctor adjust the spine as we've discussed.
And place the spine back to its position, and fix it in this way, while bleeding is stopped with albumen poultice (made of egg white), and bandage applied; cover over the algid stone-tablet whereupon my teaching lies - three books or more are enclosed within these pages, whose length corresponds exactly as to pump liquid out from depressed area around spondyl.
And return it (the intestine or hernia) back to its cavity, and introduce the malady'supremum(nutritive fluid/humor), into which it will heal.
If there is any indication in the place at the end of healing, it means that medicines have been applied to moisturize and cleanse for a long time as recommended (which has already been administered here), namely limestone layer placed on this location.

Sapiens that the hip joint and muscular connection only so slightly becomes dislocated, without wounding those waters which you would otherwise harm at other smaller body connections with less curvature." translates to "You who understand that the hip joint's slight misalignment is just a minor dislocation without damaging the fluids surrounding these areas. Unlike injuries caused by displacing fluid in more delicate, concave parts of the body during other movements or conditions.
E the joint of the wide is dislocated according to four ways, it can be dislocated at the parts inward, or towards the inside, or forward, or behind;
Mostly it is dislocated at the joints and rarely in front of or behind them.
E when the dislocation of his limb occurs among its parts, as you adjust the bandage on the healthy joint, it is applied long and tightened up with pressure to restore strength from where it was injured, so that the displaced joint does not bend backward under tension or attempt to sprain further.
When that which causes the displacement of him is due to accidents happening elsewhere in his body parts, it means these accidents are contrary or opposing those occurrences causing the dislocation.
When the name of that person to which dislocation has occurred nearby spreads outwards through their cushion placed below, and if it proceeds further away from there without being able to move onward towards those parts at this time; his urine is retained within him and a drop occurs in place, making them walk with the sole of their foot.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: When you have loosened dislocation at the posterior parts of it so that none expands its joint (no expansion or bending), nor can such a thing double what is already engaging, and this cushion placed undernethy is short like another's, which keeps their hips in place.
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and if the dislocation is old and ancient, already treated by your previous reductions here at Rome according to its disposition—not in all treatments; hence do not look for any improvement therein now.
In that where the dislocation is recent and one of the four species of dislocation, then take up what has come out to straighten the joint and extend it towards the limbs above and below, as well as to both right and left sides; once done, no other treatment will be necessary.
May, if it does not return in this attempt, then the servant who prepares must act strongly and extend the cushion under their limbs from where they were placed for a while; or hold them themselves tightly with what is bound above that rests on the underside of said cushion. Another servant extends the bandage over therefrom up to those extremities, touching gently so as not to disturb it further; and another secures firmly by means of rope (or leather strap), holding tightly at their limb's tip.
When there is extension from the limb joints towards the chest or between the shoulder blade and lower back of the thorax, it implies that movement may be causing pain in these areas.
If all of them experience extension within a period until the malady is lifted and rises above their place on earth, then so be it.
This particular type of extension affects all four parts as well.
And if the dislocation returns with water that we have discussed, be well; but if not, it is necessary for all special waters needed for their own treatment.
In the patient's reduction, when it is dislocated, and its displacement occurs at joints, causing the hernia to sit upon their backbone; hold the ligaments over the area between the waist of the thigh where the head meets that place from which they bend forward; extend the ligament on the part of the angulated shoulder towards either end point of the shoulder blade.
And another servant applies pressure to the limbs of him/her, and compresses firmly in all parts downwards strongly until that place returns (goes back) to its original position.
This specific is of yellow pus that heals this body part, which other substances do not reduce it.
May it be excused upon you and not obeyed in this particular form of healing care, where the two pills taken at mealtime serve as a link between both legs and feet through ligaments and tendons, ensuring strength for those parts together with them.
Whenever any part of a patient' extrication length is four times their body size and the groin cushion extends as much as two parts in that same measurement, it means:
Return the scrotum positioned on the head of the staff and placed in the middle (of its length), which corresponds to two cubits from the ground, as measured by one's foot span.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Command a strong young man to reduce the head of the hernia and have another youth suspended above it, whereby the other boy presses upon its strength until it returns to its proper place quickly.
In the reduction itself, when it is dislocated from behind, where the hump of the belly presses upon the buttock as per our recommendations in this manual; and its sinews are placed properly on the hollowed part of the belly and over the chest.
Here are the translations line by line:
Each minister extends to his/her area; and the doctor holds on with their mouth according to art.
When dislocation occurs towards the parts below (downwards), it is necessary for the cushion to be extended downwardly, and this second method describes what I tell you; the doctor places his palm's fourth finger on the lower thigh area, supports one hand there while extending with the other, resting that same support at the location of dislocation (downwards), where it is stretched.
If dislocation is at the joints behind, do not allow that humidity to spread outwards and rise onto the ground—have someone who has stopped it in its tracks stand over a solid foundation; there should be another person holding his hand if he is dislocated from the parts further back, as we have stated regarding two anchors for support. There shall be no pain on his face or ligaments when extended outward, just as described hereinabove.
When compression is applied with a table over the location where joint pain occurs.
So when the reduction is completed as instructed, and "the name of the reduction" does not worry you, then extend cushions from undernethy (patient's thighs), once done so adjust hips and pause-embrace them; this way ensuring that broadband/wide part doesn’t protrude in any section. Keep these bands on for three to four days straight.
Return the sinew and bandage to its place, compare one cushion with another.
And if you see those crazy ones in a state of seizure, then understand that the dislocation has already been fixed, and so let' extrusion come out (from Latin: "dislocatio"). The translation seems to be describing a medical procedure where upon noticing someone with convulsions caused by what could have been a joint injury or sprain ("crazy ones"), it is recognized that whatever had dislocated has now returned into its proper position, allowing the disp
And if you discover any cause of suppuration (which indicates infection and pus formation), then return to treat it by applying an emplastrum thereof (an external dressing or bandage) according to your first technique, and leave that for three days. Here the text seems to be giving instructions on how to deal with a wound that has become infected ("suppuration"). The advice is likely drawn from traditional medical practices of applying an emplastrum as both protection against infection spreading further into deeper tissues (as indicated by
Then lift that part up and allow it to walk on crutches for as many days until comfortable (translation suggesting a period of immobilization with the aid of crutches). This indicates after treating an infected area or following any other medical procedure, patients are advised rest and limited mobility – here specifically using assistive devices like crutches to prevent

The thigh is out of joint three times (translation unclear but seems to be referring to multiple instances or recurrences), it has been dislocated both above and below the knee, as well as forward/backward movements; nowhere else are there no more occurrences. This statement from a medical context implies that after treating an initial joint dislocation with certain procedures (which seem undefined but may include manipulation or specific exersitary actions), further episodes of misalignment ("dislocations") have ceased, suggesting successful treatment at the time in question. The instructions likely come from historical medical texts on handling and correcting a thigh's disp
The name of the displacement is that you command the bowel to apply its cushion in the thigh area; be aware, it gets dislocated.

And it is for this reason that her couch rests upon the thigh at its elevation, not laboring.
Return and apply that bandage to the thigh area, attaching it securely with strips of cloth for three days or four, then remove those.
And do not use the humoral fluid of walking for more than a few days until it is healed and comforted.
May as well the reduction of your condition be excused from you, then apply strong extension to the tendons mentioned in the previous treatment for your joint'dictions.

Regarding the treatment for a tarsal dislocation, here's how one might interpret and translate that line considering its context:
The heel occasionally is twisted due to slight motion or displacement; the sprain of it occurs in any joints or extremities.
The translation of each line from Latin-influenced medieval medical text into English would be as follows:
May the cure of his return be easier and more comfortable, so that it is extended for ease of movement as well as being kept within until he returns.
When in the treatment of him when he is dislocated again, make sure you straighten his thigh correctly and hold that hand strong and valuable from behind the two legs at the place where it rests there.
Return yourself the tender thigh of the patient lying supine on the bed and your left hand to their belly button area in the location of the navel, where you have already provided comfort with a cushion for them both.
Return the arm to your left for two steps, and return it again with an extension of the arm on its left side; press the hand bone against the back of the cushion you have there as part of three turns.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and it occurs when they have eaten recently (after meals), according to what has
And thus lifts the chest of the patient into position on their bed gently afterward (carefully), and you are at the footstool/bedside restraint.
Thus if the patient returns to health in one or two follow-thy days of treatment and their foot does not become swollen again, then all is well; but otherwise, continue the operation until that return occurs.
If you are not allowed to reduce it with the water we have prepared, then the hernia will complain above your knees on land, and a tightly woven mat is placed there; between the thighs of yours, and you already enveloped him in cloth so that he does not expose himself.
Return the minister of mercury to their thighs and have another minister extend the patient'se skin or bandage above it that rests on the back of the knee; similarly, expand each appointed official against his extension part so that Mercury will not be drawn out from these parts tonight.
Here the doctor applies pressure on the displacement and another servant holds onto healthy parts of the body until the displacement returns to ease.
So when the dislocation returns and it is declared to you that there has been restoration of your body, then apply strong compression bandages and bind tightly this limb with its sinew attached to the cushion.
When you fear or protect the nerves located behind your ankle, to prevent them from being forcefully pulled and led astray on that part of the foot.
Return that thing for two or three days, and if it is made softer by the ligature, extend it further outward.
Return that item there in the morning or afternoon and prevent it from entering for forty days. May it not be the case that if one goes into this space, there is no guarantee that loosening or rupture will not occur here and they do not receive treatment care; return them to their proper place immediately.
If you apply a poultice to the wound we have described previously (in this account), administer it in the location where applied and leave until repletion occurs.
Based on the provided medieval medical text'dictions in an archaic form of
The phrase "Capitol .xxxiiii." appears to be a citation marker rather than actual content from the treatise, likely indicating page
The translation of this line from the medieval medical treatise is: "When that which has been dislocated is thrown back only a little, and it's not difficult to set right again." Here, doctors are describing an initial conservative approach for addressing a partial shoulder (or arm) dislocation. It suggests simple repositioning if possible when the displacement of bone from its joint is minimal and can be corrected with basic man
The translation for this line is: "If the dislocation occurs in the joints of your arm near the shoulder blade (shoulder), then carry out a procedure whereby you lift up your malady or hernia, with one hand underne0r on its position over land's tabletop/ladder and keep it there as if carried." Here doctors describe an ancient technique for treating dislocations by manually manipulating the affected body part to restore proper alignment. The phrasing reflects a time when medical understanding was intertwined with physical actions rather than modern surgical procedures, suggesting that
The translation of this line is: "Treat the positioning of your feet and pause there where you imagine it at the joints; apply chalk to that part underneath which lies a hernia, so as they can return what's inside with caution until retention occurs without appearing in prominence. Here doctors are advising on how one might deal with suspected inguinal (belly-button) or similar types of internal protrusions ("vertuts") which may become dislocated, using chalk to stabilize the area and facilitate a return to its original position within the body cavity. The emphasis is likely on non-invasive methods for managing

And when the limb returns as we pour, then apply the regimen that dissolves putrefaction and heals what is appropriate to it according to the ointments dried out by the spirits.
If dislocation occurs and there is a crack in the separated bones, then you must set their position again, making sure they have what was mentioned earlier about these simple waters that were described at those locations of them.
