The Ancients said that when a cancer is in a site where total eradication is possible, such as a cancer of the breast or of the thigh, and in similar parts where complete removal is possible, and especially when in the early stage and small, (then surgery was to be tried).

Then attach to the tumour hooks suited to it; then make a circular incision all round to include the skin with the utmost thoroughness so that not the least root of it remains; let the blood flow and do not stanch it quickly; but put pressure upon the place and squeeze out all the thick blood, either by hand or with any instrument you can.	Then apply hooks to the cancer that suit it. Afterward, hollow it out from every part along with the skin, according to examination, until nothing of its roots remains: and allow the blood to flow, and do not cut it off quickly; rather, press the places and wipe away all thick blood by hand, or with any possible instrument.	0.8730066
If in operating you get a very severe haemorrhage from cutting an artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops; then dress in the usual way until healed.	But if the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein causes you trouble, then cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops. Then treat it with the remaining remedies, until it heals.	0.75357103
