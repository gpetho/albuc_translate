Sebel are red veins that are covered over the eye, and take away the vision and weaken the eye always. It is necessary first to see if the eye in which sebel is present is strong, and there is no other disease except sebel; then remove it in this manner: command the patient to place his head in your lap, then suspend those veins with the hook according to his wisdom, and let the hook be delicate and double according to this form:	Pannus is a network of blood-vessels spreading over the eye so as to interfere with the function of sight and, in the course of time, weakening the eye. You must first examine, and if the eye with the pannus be strong, with no fault other than the pannus, then the pannus should be gathered up. This is done by bidding the patient put his head in your lap; then, as skilfully as you may, pick up those blood-vessels with one or two hooks. The hooks should be of a gentle curve, like this.	0.735507
And let there be two hooks by degrees in one body according to this form:	Or there can be two hooks joined together on one handle, thus.	0.5452885
then take those veins with small forceps, and wipe the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye; and be careful not to injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this procedure at noon before the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you do not cut anything but those veins; and when you have done this, distill green and red eyewash into the eye to destroy what remains of the sebel.	Then take up the blood-vessels gently with the fine scissors, and wipe away the blood constantly, till you see all those blood-vessels removed from the eye, and the blood wells forth. But be careful of the eye lest you damage it with the points of the scissors. Let your work be done in broad sunlight at midday; and be very steady in your action so as to cut nothing beside the bloodvessels. When you have finished, instil the red or green lotion into the eye to destroy by its caustic action the remnants of the pannus.	0.8646127
And if you cannot gather all of it in that hour, then make a plaster on the eye with things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for some days until the pain is soothed and it is assured from a hot abscess, then restart according to this manner which is described before until it is healed; and this is the form of the forceps:	If you are unable to gather it all up at that one time, apply a plaster to the eye such as will allay the pain, and leave him* for a few days till* the pain be eased and there is no danger of an abscess. Then repeat the operation in the same manner till it is healed. This is a figure of the scissors. [	0.80122626
