On the treatment of knotting in the scar of a fracture.
Chapter 21.
This knotting often occurs in the scar of a healed fracture.
Especially when near the joints, it distorts the shape of the limb.
It may even prevent the limb from functioning naturally.
Therefore, if the knot is recent, apply medicines with astringent properties, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar substances.
Take some or all of these, mix them with astringent wine, egg white, or vinegar, and apply them over the knot in tow, binding them tightly.
Leave the binding on and do not loosen it for many days.
Then loosen it, reapply another, and repeat until the knot disappears.
Or bind a lead plate over it firmly.
Lead has the property of removing all such concerns from the limbs.
If the knot has hardened into stone and is constricting, and there is an urgent need to remove it, then cut it from above and remove the protruding excess, or shave it down with certain rasps until it is gone, and treat it until it heals.
