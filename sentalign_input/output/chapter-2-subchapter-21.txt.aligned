And if the eye shows great prominence, pierce it with a fine spatula that reaches deep into the eye, and drain the albuginous humour and lower the eye, and enter it immediately; then drain it until it is healed.	Then you perforate it with a fine scalpel going to the depth of the eye; and an albuminous humour will flow out and the eye will shrink and return at once. Then bandage till healed.	0.7870745
