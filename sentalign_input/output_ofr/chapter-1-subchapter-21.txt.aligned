of the pain of the teeth	On cauterization for toothache.	0.41346213
When toothache comes from cold, where there is cold or a worm, and medicinal treatments are ineffective, then cautery is necessary in two ways: cautery with butter and cautery with fire.	When the toothache arises on account of cold, or if there be a worm in the tooth, and medical treatment does not avail, then cauterization should be undertaken. There are two ways of doing this, one with butter, the other with the cautery.	0.8401722
Cautery with butter is such that you take cow's butter, and melt it in an iron or brass spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the tip of a tent, and soak it in boiling butter, and apply it quickly to the aching tooth and hold it there until it cools; and do this often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish also soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and apply a hot iron until the heat reaches the end of the tooth.	Cauterization with butter is done thus: take cows' butter and let it boil in an iron ladle or pan; then take cotton wool, wind it round the top of a probe, and dip it in the boiling butter and quickly apply it to the aching tooth and hold it there till cold. Repeat this a number of times till the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. If you prefer, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and put it on the aching tooth, then on top of that apply the hot iron until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.	0.92961335
The cautery with fire is as follows: you take a rod of iron or brass, thick enough so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth; then heat the cautery, the shape of which will come later, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand there until the cautery cools; do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.	The actual cautery is administered thus: take a tube of bronze or iron with some thickness in the body of it so that the intensity of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then heat a cautery whose figure will be given shortly, and apply it to the tooth itself and hold your hand until the cautery gets cold. Do this several times over; the pain will certainly depart the same day or the next.	0.9035784
And the patient must fill his mouth with good butter immediately after this cautery, and then spit it out; and this is the shape of the cautery:	After this cauterization the patient is to fill his mouth with good butter and keep it in for a while, then spit it out. This is the figure of the cautery.	0.78659284
