of abscesses of the womb/uterus	On the perforation of eruptions occurring in the uterus.	0.44882536
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb/uterus, such as canker and stony abscess and herpes and corroding ulcers and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and several other illnesses that I mentioned in the division/classification.	From time to time there occur in the womb various kinds of tumour, such as cancer and the stony tumour and ulcer and abscess and gangrene and fistulae and varicosities and cracks and warts and inflamed tumours; all these diseases I have mentioned, with their varieties and their symptoms, in the appropriate section.	0.7434635
It is therefore necessary that I discuss in this treatise the hot abscess that occurs in the womb/uterus, which is not among the abscesses that collect pus; and if you want to know how to proceed, observe if the abscess is acute at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it.	But now in this treatise we must mention an inflamed tumour of the kind where there is a collection of pus, and the manner of its opening with the knife. You should inspect it, and if the pain of the tumour is acute from the outset, with pulsation and inflammation and fever, and, if it is visible, you see that it is red, then do not be in a hurry to open, but treat it with applications helpful for suppuration till these symptoms have subsided.	0.75800824
And if the wound is deep in the womb/uterus, you must avoid cauterizing with iron, but treat it as we have described in the classification/division.	But if the lesion be hidden in the depths of the womb then you will have to abstain from operative treatment but carry out treatment as spoken of in its place.	0.6281021
