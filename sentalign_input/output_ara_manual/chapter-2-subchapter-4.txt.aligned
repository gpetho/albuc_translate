On the treatment of a constant flow of hot tears to the eyes.	On the treatment of a chronic flux of bitter tears into the eyes.	0.86553454
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the vessels on the outside of the skull, and nothing from medical treatment with medicines has been beneficial, and you see that the patient's face has reddened. And he feels a tingling in his forehead like the tingling of ants, and his eyes are loose and moist, their lashes eroded, and their eyelids stuck together from the sharpness of the tears.  The ancients were compelled in treating this to this procedure, and they call it "treatment with the sword." It is that you order the patient to shave the hair on his forehead.	When lachrymation is chronic and arises from the external vessels on the cranium, nor does treatment by any kind of medical remedy have any effect, and you see the patient's features flushed, and he feels a creeping in his forehead like that of an ant, and his eyes are wasted and moist, and the roots of the lashes itch, and the eyelids are burned by the bitterness of the tears, the Ancients were compelled to treat it by this operation which they called 'treatment by the sword'.	0.83230066
Then you make three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead, and the length of the incision is about two fingers. One incision is parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second is a little distance from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third is on the other side.	You bid the patient shave the hair of his forehead; then you make three parallel incisions across his forehead a little apart; and let the length of each incision be two fingers' breadths; the first incision continuing the line of the nose in the middle of the forehead; and the second at a little distance from the temporal muscle; and the third incision on the other side of the forehead.	0.8479328
And beware of cutting the two arteries that are on the sides, and keep your hand away from the joining of the jaws.  Let the distance between each incision be the width of three fingers pressed together. And have with you prepared pieces of sponge or many dry rags with which to wipe the blood.	Beware of cutting the two arteries which are at the sides, and keep your hand away from the mandibular joint; and let there be a distance between each incision as of three fingers joined. Have ready by you some pieces of sponge or a number of linen towels to wipe away the blood.	0.9343762
Then you insert the sharp, two-pointed scalpel, which is pictured here. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, you peel with it all the skin between the two incisions, along with the membrane that is on the bone.  Then you also do this from the middle incision to the third incision. Then you take out this scalpel. And you also insert into the first incision another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and smooth, not sharp, on the other side, and this is its picture:.	Then introduce the double-edged scalpel shaped thus through the incision near the temple to the middle incision, and with it pare off all the skin between the two incisions with the periosteum; then do the same from the middle incision to the third one; then draw out this scalpel and introduce into the first incision another instrument which is known as 'the knife-shaped': sharp on one side, smooth and blunt on the other, thus.	0.8738128
And you turn its sharp side upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin and its smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision, and you cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.	The sharp edge of it should be turned upward to the subcutaneous tissue and the smooth edge toward the bone; then push it on to reach the middle incision and with it cut all the vessels passing from the head down toward the eyes, without letting the incision come through the outer skin.	0.8355266
Then you do that in the middle incision to the other incision, and after a moderate amount of blood has flowed, you squeeze the places where the clotted blood has been cut. Then you put in each incision a cotton wick moistened with wine and oil or vinegar and oil, and place a compress on it.	Then do the same from the middle incision to the third. After a moderate quantity of blood has flowed, express the bits of blood-clot from the place and pack into each incision a pad of teased-out cotton wool. Over all put a pad soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar and oil, lest an effusion occur.	0.8672863
So that a hot swelling does not occur, and on the third day you loosen the bandage and use frequent washing with lukewarm water, then you treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and all the other things you treat wounds with, until it heals, God willing.	On the third day loosen the bandage and rinse with plenty of tepid water and afterwards dress with balm of basilicon with rose-ointment and other treatments for wounds, until healed.	0.79087937
